This database is an alpha testing. It allows for you to search across the entire Volume 7 collection of data. To search, type a query into the Descriptions section and you will see results that contain that string match. Note, that this is case-sensitive. Since this tool is designed in Python with Pandas and RegEx (Regular Expressions), you can do Pandas-based queries.

To search for multiple terms, for example, use a | in your search. To search for COSAS and kicked, therefore, you would do the following:

COSAS|kicked

Note the lack of spaces

The Strict Search On will make it so that all terms that appear in your search must be in a single description
