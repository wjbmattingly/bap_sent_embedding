            "Good Morning everybody.  You will recall that yesterday we commenced the hearing and then an application was made by both Messrs Rudolph and Terre'blanche, the applicants, in relation to the Ventersdorp incident and that thereafter we proceeded with the evidence of Mr Terre'blanche in regard to the other incidents in respect of which he applies for amnesty.\n\tWe dealt with the evidence concerning the Van Jaarsveld incident.  I think it would probably be more convenient at this stage, Mr Terre'blanche, if we just - I am sure it will not take long, deal with the weapons incident and then get back to the Ventersdorp incident and then we will deal with the two of you together instead of going back to the Ventersdorp and then back to your own application later.\n\tSo if we can, at this stage then, proceed with the application relating to the weapons and essentially this application is a chamber matter really, because it doesn't involve any form of gross human rights violation as defined in the Act, but we would appreciate it if you would just give us some information relating particularly to a description of the weapons used, the amount and type of weapons and the reason why they were in your possession, perhaps, and anything else that you wish to tell us about that.\n\tSo if we could proceed on that basis and I would remind you that you are still under your declaration to tell the truth.",

            "Mr Chairman, during 1982, the AWB got hold of some weapons.  In court it was said at the time, that the weapons, the ammunition of which I had never seen the identity, but as was described in court it was parts of AK47s and would I suppose one or two pistols.  These weapons, members of the AWB got it from a member of the,  Mr Kees Moos, an erstwhile member of the AWB.  I became aware of that when later it was shown at a house in Delmas and the allegation was made that the ammunition was up in a cupboard and parts of weapons were stored in trunks.  \tThe idea with regard to the getting hold of the weapons was to keep those should the erstwhile government capitulate in the same way that the white colonial governments, in a very short time span, handed over their power to a majority government and the fear was voiced by members of the AWB that the same fate could be that of the whites in South Africa with a very fast taking over of power resulting in chaos, that as is the case of the Belgian Congo, as was the case with the Belgian Congo and other places, murder would take place and people would lose their lives.\n\tI was confronted by this situation and even though I - and that was also said in the Supreme Court and it could not be refuted, to say that I should get rid of these things, it was a trap because the man who I obtained it from had, it was a Dutch person, Mr Moos, who also fled from the country.  I received it from him, because I didn't trust him.\n\tBe that as it may, the weapons were taken to my brother's farm and I became aware of it when it arrived there.  We then buried the weapons with the purpose that should we need to one day protect ourselves, our property, homes, as in the case with the Portuguese in the Congo and to have it at hand if there was no order in which to protect ourselves.\n\tThat was also our defence in the Supreme Court and the verdict of the judge was that we would in any case not be allowed to possess those weapons even though the intention would be to use it in order to protect ourselves.  We therefore had the weapons in our possession illegally.  We had those weapons in our possession. \n\tThe judge did say in his verdict that we, to a great extent, were the victims of circumstances.  I reconciled myself with the idea at the time that under those circumstances it would be well and right that the weapons should not be given, handed over to the police but for political reasons we were to keep them should the history repeat itself and we are being confronted and being put in chaos and evolution by other forces.\n\tI humbly submit that I do qualify for amnesty for the possession of these weapons.  It was the organisation, the AWB, who accepted responsibility for those weapons.  I, as leader of the AWB, finally accepted responsibility.  We kept it there and it had to stay there until a situation would arise that we would perhaps need it in a situation of chaos and warfare.  That is my side of the story, Sir.",

Where he got those weapons from, I do not know.  He told us that he had bought them.  The weapons were fetched from his plot by a one Mr du Plessis from Delmas and a one Mr Jan Groeneveld from Pretoria.  The weapons were then transported to Delmas to the Du Plessis' farm.\n\tI was then called to Delmas, upon which I was told that they had weapons in a cupboard, that they were came from Mr Moos.  I then gave a directive that we should get rid of them.  That was never doubted in the Supreme Court.  The person who was responsible for removing those weapons then again said in court that he did not know how to get rid of them and that he then took it to his good friend, my brother's farm where one of them buried them.\n\tIt was two trucks were filled with weapons and like as I have said before, pieces of ammunition.  The weapons in most cases were dissembled.  There was also ammunition.  I then came to my, went to my brother and this person to his farm upon which I agreed that we should not transport it any further and therefore we buried it there.

If I could just refer back to the tarring and feathering situation again during which an historian was tarred and feathered.  I would just like to mention that often, especially with regard to the statement being read here yesterday, quite often people stand outside of politics in a specific career, but because of their knowledge and the opportunity play a large political role and could move political thinking in a certain direction.  Churches do the same as well as historians.  Professor Heyns, because of standpoints he took, gave a specific direction to politics and played a large role to the extent that everything points to the fact that it was political activists who also killed the professor.\n\tI would like to mention those two cases and I would immediately like to add that it was not the style of the AWB to, either within the act of politics or those people getting direction in politics, to kill those people or to in any way harm them bodily.  The furtherest the movement went in our case was to tar and feather the person without there ever being an intention of doing bodily harm to him.\n\tComing to the Ventersdorp situation, I would also like to have something to say on that.

            "Mr Chairperson, I have just received a piece of information, if you would just allow me to read through it, it won't take a minute.\n\tChairperson, no, as regards Ventersdorp, I just want to keep to the standpoint that the intensity in the whole matter was that Mr de Klerk should speak.  We wanted him to appear here and to talk.  We wanted to put questions to him which we believed would bring him great political embarrassment.  We wanted to prove that in places such as Ventersdorp, the rural areas, that he was no longer acceptable.  \n\tYou will remember that Ventersdorp was then already a seat for the Conservative Party and that he had defeated Deputy Minister Wilkins there in the previous election.  We wanted to challenge Mr de Klerk.  It was a few of his, some of his promises which he never kept.  We had the situation of growing squatter camps in the surrounding areas, but what is most important is that we wanted to destroy him politically in Ventersdorp by giving him a - the fact that we did not trust him in Ventersdorp, that we had lost all confidence in him and that he was no longer acceptable as President and as leader of the country.\n\tI also want to say that, as a result of the arrival of the police and the dogs and the Defence Force and the arrogance which the State President had already dealt with before this situation, before the election, as a result of the media's constant publication that conflict was looming between the AWB and the State President, the inciting of, the interest that was created and the high octane publicity that it received affected not only the AWB but all members who were not members of the National Party.  ...(indistinct) prepared these people spiritually for one or other form of confrontation.\n\tI also want to mention, which I did not mention yesterday and that is that the member of the Assembly of the Conservative Party, Mr Fanie van Vuuren was between the first three of people who walked to the hall where Mr de Klerk was.  There were many members from the Conservative Party and other parties and that members of the Conservative Party and members of the AWB had armed themselves with sticks etc., with which to hit the dogs who were set loose upon them.  That is true.  A situation of war was created by the media.\n\tI also want to emphasise that I did have a letter in which it was said that a delegation would meet Mr Amie Coetzee and General Malan who had come to see them in order to make arrangements that these people would be allowed to ask Mr de Klerk questions.  This was at my request and at the request of Mr Rudolph.    \tUnfortunately, I reached, this document reached me very late and on receipt thereof, because I had decided to hold my own meeting at the town hall, Ferdie Hartzenberg and I from the Conservative Party, Ferdie had held his meeting that afternoon already.  I don't know whether he had left Ventersdorp but at seven thirty I decided that I would hold a meeting, which we then did.\n\tHowever, when the document reached me, that they were prepared to talk, I regarded this as the ideal opportunity and as a breakthrough because I wanted to be in that hall.  I think that I was prepared to meet Mr de Klerk politically and by means of arguments to defeat him there.  On my way to the hall the masses shouted that the would go with and no-one, as was testified, could prevent these people who were not only from the AWB, from also asking questions. These were very extreme circumstances and then unfortunately the incident took place which I mentioned yesterday and I will reply to any questions that you might still have regarding this matter.

            "Thank you.  As indicated yesterday there was this application - as indicated earlier, there was this application to have Mr de Klerk subpoenaed.  I would like, at this stage, just to make the ruling on that before we proceed with the matter.\nR U L I N G\n   Both the applicants have applied for Mr F W de Klerk, the former State President, to be called as a witness and to testify as a witness in this matter.  They have both expressed the belief that the actions taken by Mr de Klerk were the proximate cause of the so-called battle of Ventersdorp, and accordingly that it was he and the members of the forces acting on his behalf who were responsible therefore.  They have both stated that Mr de Klerk should be compelled to testify at this hearing so that they may put questions to him and so that he may explain inter alia why he \nvisited Ventersdorp on the day in question and also to explain the actions of the members of the Security Forces on that day.\n\tSection 29 1(c) of the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act number 34 of 1995, that is the Act that establishes the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and which governs the conduct of these proceedings, provides that:\n\"The Commission made for purposes of the holding of a hearing by notice, in writing, call upon any person to appear before the Commission and to give evidence or to answer questions relevant to the subject matter of the hearing.\"\n\tIt is clear from this that the decision to subpoena a person to testify at a hearing rests entirely with the Commission.  Before such a decision is taken this Committee must be satisfied that it is both essential and necessary for such person to testify in order to enable it to arrive at a just decision in regard to the granting or refusal of amnesty.\n\tWe, after consideration of the information placed before us, including the submissions of the applicants and the written applications, are of the view that the evidence of Mr de Klerk would not be essential and necessary in order to enable us to arrive at a just decision in this matter.\n\tOur duty is to determine whether the applicants have satisfied the criteria set out in the aforesaid Act for the granting of amnesty, namely that the acts committed by them were acts associated with a political objective as defined in the Act.  That they have made a full disclosure of their own participation and that  their applications comply with the requirements of the Act.  We are satisfied that such a determination will be able to be arrived at without the testimony of Mr de Klerk.\n\tIn deciding whether the above criteria have been satisfied, it will not be necessary to establish which side involved in the conflict was guilty of causing the conflict.  This is not an investigation into the causes of the Battle of Ventersdorp but is an amnesty application of the two applicants.  The applicants will neither be prejudiced nor compromised in the absence of the testimony of Mr de Klerk.\n\tWe accordingly rule that the application to have Mr de Klerk subpoenaed as a witness in this matter be REFUSED.  \n\tWe have been informed that Mr de Klerk did receive notification in terms of Section 19 4 of the Act, and that he was informed of his rights to attend this hearing and to adduce evidence if he so desires.  Obviously he has elected not to attend or to adduce evidence.   So that is the ruling.  \n\tI would just like to stress that this ruling in no way prejudices your applications at all.  We just want to hear the role that the two of you played in the conflict and are just looking forward to a full disclosure and we feel that, with regard to the third criteria, namely that your applications comply with the requirements of the Act, that has already been fulfilled.  That is a technical matter relating to the submission of your application, the completion of them,  times etc., and they are in order, so it is just a question of the political objective and full disclosure.  And as I have said, we are of the view that we don't have to hear the evidence of the former State President, to determine whether you participated with a political objective and whether or not you've have made a full disclosure.  In this regard, it is not necessary for us to make a finding of what was the cause of the battle, who was the guilty side in the battle etc.  I hope you understand that.\n\tSo, I think then if we can then proceed with what actually happened on the day in question and what the roles were that you played in that so-called battle.  I think, in this regard - I don't know if you still want Mr Rudolph to commence with the testimony as you indicated earlier, and then we will continue with the testimony of Mr Terre'blanche.\n\tMr Rudolph, I would just like to remind you as well that you are still under your former declaration to tell the truth and then if you could just tell us what happened on the day in question and particularly the part that you played in it.",

It was then already clear that these changes, or that the changes would not leave South Africa unchanged.  Seen against that background the AWB decided to go to Mr de Klerk's meeting with the objective of putting the demands of the Boere people.  Media speculation and public interest created a climate for confrontation.\n\t\tOn the 8th of August 1991 -(excuse me for a moment, I want to make sure about a point.  Thank you, Your Honour.  I am not sure but in my application it says the 8th of August 1991).

The applicant tried to get past a police cordon but was arrested at the hall where the meeting took place and held in a police van until he was charged later that evening.\n\t\tAlthough there was a shooting incident and people were killed, the magistrate found that the applicant had already been arrested and therefore could not have had any part in the events.\n\t\tWith that I want to tell you that my involvement or responsibility, that I am not trying to get away from my responsibility with that statement.  The applicant was charged with conspiracy and public violence and found guilty.  The crime which the applicant was found guilty of which the applicant still denies was a crime had political objectives and was the main reason for the application for amnesty.\n\t\tThe applicant appealed against the sentence because reconsideration did not exist.  The applicant keeps to his conviction that he had a meeting with the Cabinet Minister and was illegally prevented by the former SAP to attend this meeting.  The appeal has since been rejected.\"\n\tAt the hearing, Your Honour, I used, made use of my right to give an explanation to the court.  As I had said that I was not guilty, I will use my civil right to explain this to the court.  And at this stage I also want to say to you that perhaps it is not in such legal terms as preferable but this is the attempt of a lay person.  If the charge sheet includes a crime then the person who has incited the crime is absent at this hearing.  His name is FW de Klerk.\n\tIf I was involved in anything which is referred to as common purpose on the charge sheet, then that purpose was to appeal for a place in the sun for my people and my religion and for the reinstatement of my peoples' freedom on the land which was taken from our forefathers by Britain.  Such action I do not regard as illegal, even less so that it was done with criminal intentions.\n\tIf I had a common purpose with anyone, then it was not to commit a crime, but in order to protect our people against the criminality of the government, led by its chief leader who used the police illegally to further its political purpose and objective, namely the destruction of any opposition against its policy of abdication.   Mr de Klerk's purpose and objective was so big that he did not want to allow any political opponents at his meetings but he was prepared to have his own people killed in the streets and he directly or indirectly gave such an instruction.\n\tTo anyone who has the experience of the Goedgevonden incident in Ventersdorp and what happened in Ventersdorp before this and who shares in this experience, it should have been clear that Mr de Klerk has before him too, Jan Smuts, will have no doubt to have his people, people who oppose him, to have been killed.\n\tIn opposition to this I tried to warn and tried to take precautions by suggesting specific action.  The public life sets high demands to those who are called to act on behalf of a cause.  Those demands require personal safety, position and status to be placed on the alter of the nation.  One cannot say that you are a leader and then doubt when the struggle, when faced with the struggle.\n\tWhen one is in the position of leadership and when not only the honour of your people but also its continued existence is being threatened and you are moving to a place where you have to act on behalf of your people and your religion, where you have a meeting, not only with a Cabinet Minister, but also with the future of your people, you do not allow yourself to be interrupted by misleading ... (end of tape) ... for the continued existence sets a high price.\n\tTherefore, I could not disrupt public calm.  I am a registered voter in the constituency of Ventersdorp - at that stage I was.  At the time of the event I was an inhabitant of Ventersdorp.  During my stay in Ventersdorp, the town was, had peace and calm while I was present there, which was most of the time.  FW de Klerk is not a registered voter in the constituency of Ventersdorp, nor was he a resident of Ventersdorp.\n\tDuring his visit to the town, accompanied by a large contingency of policemen, there was no peace and calm in the town.  The unrest is then therefore clearly to be placed in front of his door than in front of mine.  I did not disrupt the members of the community.  As a matter of fact, if the history of this time is one day seen in perspective, it can be said of me that I protected those specific rights.\n\tI am not the one who did not acknowledge the rights of the  members of the community by refusing them attendance to the public meeting.  I was not the one who denied the rights of the public community by trying to prevent them by means of violence, from keeping a meeting with Minister Amie Venter in front of the town hall.  I was not the one who made, who disrupted the lives of the people of the community by placing barbed wire there and using police dogs to attack them.  In this regard it would have been much more suitable to use the commander of the SAP during the Ventersdorp incident and to call him before court.\n\tI did not affect the authority of the South African Police.  The SAP has no other authority than to restore and to maintain law and order.  It does not fall within that authority to erect barbed wire, use teargas, bullets and vicious dogs and to take a stand against people who, for peaceful reasons, want to state a civil case.  Such action is tyranny at the highest level and it calls against, it shouts against everything that is democratic and civilised and such a State deserves absolutely no continued existence and I am very glad that that State has been destroyed.\n\tWhat is said to me in this statement is therefore not true at all.  If the State is to say that it is a crime that it is a - to fight for the survival of the Boer people and to be counted for those people and stand up for them, it is proof of only one thing which is that that State is rotten in its core.\n\tWith regard to the charge sheet, the following:  I did nothing which could substantiate me firing at the police with a firearm.  During the incident I did have a firearm on me but I never fired at anything or anybody, not even when I was provoked twice and I was assaulted by the police.\n\tI did not fire with a firearm at members of the public, I did not fire at anybody or anything, but I do know that members of the South African Police did fire at members of the general public and some of the members of the public were shot dead by the South African Police.  So in this matter the court implicated the wrong person.\n\tI did not assault members of the general public, on the contrary, I can say that members of the general public during this incident were assaulted by members of the South African Police.  In fact I myself am one of the members of the general public who was assaulted by the South African Police.  I still bear the consequences of that in that since this incident I suffer from headaches and my right arm was injured.  I have not assaulted members of the South African Police.\n\tAlso with regard to this charge, the wrong person again is in the, is being accused.  They have attacked me, I have not attacked them.  I honestly must tell you I cannot understand why the investigating officer wants to prosecute me.  I never - I find it senseless to fight vehicles in any way.  I haven't damaged property.  I did not want to break through a police cordon.  In my official capacity as Secretary General at the time I had an appointment to meet Mr Amie Venter in front of the hall.\n\tAny person who wants to avoid a member of the public to make an appointment, is acting irregularly.  I see the police cordon as nothing but an infringement on my right as a member of the public.  I haven't in any way damaged police dogs.  I have the right to protect myself if somebody instigates a vicious dog to attack me.\n\tI deny that I have worked together with anybody to commit a crime.  In the Ventersdorp episode I did see signs of conspiracy but on the side of Mr de Klerk and the South African Police and on their side Mr de Klerk, the South African Police, the South African Defence Force without conspiracy taking place beforehand, we would not have a very unpopular political personality.  \tA Police Force with barbed wire, an armed Police Force with infantry and vehicles, we would not have that simultaneously at the same place.  I am not guilty of an offence as is being made out in terms of Section 3.  I was on my way to the meeting of one FW de Klerk, to exercise my civilian right and responsibility and I also had an appointment to meet a Cabinet Minister in front of the hall.\n\tDespite the efforts of the police not to allow me to my right I did move up to the hall where I was assaulted for a second time by the police.  I was not allowed to attend the meeting, I was arrested and I was illegally detained.\n\tI am, as I have already said, a registered voter in the Ventersdorp constituency and at the time I was living in Ventersdorp.  I have a democratic right to attend a meeting as a leader of a registered political party and to listen to the abdicating State President.  Mr de Klerk was at Ventersdorp in his capacity as State President and if that was not the case I would have liked to have questioned him about that if the State was to call him as witness.\n\tYour Honour, could I then at this stage just ask, there are certain exhibits then which will not be relevant.  I would nevertheless like to hand in the document so that you could then later use it or do you expect me to rather go through the total document?",

            "Thank you very much.  I would like to say to you, if the afternoon before the meeting of the, - was present, you would have seen the person who gave evidence before you, General Malan, and in which you gave a verdict and I have no problem with that.  I believe that General Malan should have made a good impression on the court, but it was placed on record that there was tension between myself and General Malan. And I respectfully submit that if you were present that afternoon, you would also have come to the conclusion to which I came, that General Malan and his people, because they wanted to fight, were prepared to treat people very badly to say the least of it.\n\tI have seen the glowing of war in his eyes.  You saw him at the coals of the burnt out fire, and it was astounding if one looked at the role of the police that old friends such as Brigadier Scholtz and those people who were house, friends moved past one another in order to contact one another telephonically while it could have been sorted out in a different way if we were prepared to look one another in the eye.  I refer to this Your Honour because you have that document in your possession.  \n\tI expected Brigadier Scholtz to at least - because he was a friend of Mr Terre'blanche, I thought that he would go to trouble to go to Mr Terre'blanche's house.  He was well known to us, he wouldn't have been an enemy.  I would like to tell you Your Honour that if in the process I bent over backwards to - when Brigadier Scholtz gave me the message, to be more accommodating instead of telling him that I could not get hold of Mr Terre'blanche and it was water under the bridge, that whole incident could have had a different course.\n\tI think then that I have done my duty as the Secretary General of the AWB.  I haven't done it properly when I haven't tried to get hold of Mr Terre'blanche.  That however is water under the bridge, but in front of the post office in Ventersdorp I knew that the police became those people in the hands of the people who referred to that voice of the people, but they did not realise that it was a symphony of freedom and the ringing out of gunshots would ... Long ago other people also wanted to hear the voice of black nationalists and today that voice speaks louder and, Your Honour, one of these days it will be the voice of the government.  That is what I said in court.  \n\tIn Ventersdorp I was under the leadership of the AWB and then I further said about this matter, Your Honour, never the situation with regard to our nation was darker.  We had lost our freedom for the second time in an exhausting war.  We have lost so many people in the union.  We became a member of the - however it didn't make an end to that war, the Republic of South Africa would also be in the same situation.  That Republic didn't bring freedom, in fact it only brought about further problems.  A late ...(indistinct) Premier and State President Mr Vorster, during the war, was arrested and held by a government who regarded him as somebody they did not need but he became the Minister of Justice when his people again put the Mandelas and Sisulus in jail.\n\tToday those same people are getting ready to become the government of tomorrow.  Our road is a road of struggle.  I mentioned these dangers to the court in order to demonstrate that the law plays an important role in the development of a nation.  People standing today in court may tomorrow have power in their hands.  In other words what is going wrong today could be correct tomorrow, what is right today could be proved wrong tomorrow.\n\tIn saying this, I do not want to say that you should not proceed in doing your duty.  What I do tell you is that if you look at the community's interests, you should also take into consideration that it is fluid and in our case that there is division.  I also tell you this because I asked you before that when you listen to all these, you should not look at it as though we are ordinary criminals in order to murder people, rape people.  In fact the same motivation was the motivation which motivated people here and internationally to the position of coming into power.\n\tThe fact that the government refused to speak to its opponents does not make that but a heavy penalty cannot silence you.  In my time I could tell my political enemies behind the walls of the jail, your ideals grow even further and it becomes larger in life and therefore you don't have to look at me.  The best example is Mr Nelson Mandela.\n\tThe meeting at Ventersdorp which caused this was a meeting that was held by the State President.  If people worried about the course of things, there was no better man than the State President to allay those fears.  Prior to that there were problems with the squatters at Goedgevonden, squatters who took the land of the Boers because they were being threatened and they became the minority in their own country.  The only place in the world where there is a comparative example is in Palestine, where the Jews came in and the result was that to this day there is not peace there. \n\tIn such a situation, no peace is possible neither in Palestine nor in Transvaal.  A problem that needs to be solved is the position of the Boer nation in South Africa.  The government is speaking to the ANC and even minority parties with regard to a new dispensation and it is being pretended as if the Boers do not exist and as if it doesn't matter.  I want to say categorically that I experience among the whites that there are more people supporting the Boer State than communists supporting Joe Slovo, but he is in Kempton Park as an important negotiator while the Boers want freedom.\n\tThe day will dawn that these walls will also be evidence that there were farmers or Boers who tried very hard to bring about freedom.  A place where it should be done was in Potchefstroom, but Ventersdorp in the commando hall, it wanted to stop the State President and with the role name of Rex, they wanted to keep their opponents away.  \n\tIn the case of Mr de Klerk, it was Rex vs the Truth.  Mr de Klerk had to seek refuge in a Casspir.  He didn't - another matter that needs to be solved are those Boers in the, on death row.  Mr de Klerk was at Ventersdorp during the darkest crisis in our nation's history, when all of us doubted where the road would take us to.  He preferred not to allay those fears.  It wasn't allayed.  We will see it again and it will be even worse that Ventersdorp but for that Mr de Klerk has to stand farther.  The fact that I am not a member of the AWB does not mean that I have stopped my fight.  \n\tAnd then I would quickly like to refer to another document which I held at Mr Cyrus Vance who is not of importance here.   I further said in desperation, I had to correspond with the ANC.  In this regard I also sent a letter to Mr Mandela as an indication of the fact that I wanted rather to talk instead of to shoot.  I couldn't speak to Mr de Klerk but because of the temporary situation with regard to Mr de Klerk I would rather speak to Mr Mandela, which is an indication of my approach.  \n\tThen Your Honour, I also said in that court, as I have done yesterday, and I would just like to repeat it quickly.  In conclusion, I would like to quote quickly with regard to the flame in my chest, paining in my chest, so that you can know that it is not only in my chest but also in the hearts of other people.   We are part of history.  We are part and witnesses of this and if I know you would understand it.  I would like to quote from a court case which took place in 1962, in October which was the Rivonia trial of the current State President on 22 October 1962, and in that Mr Mandela said:\n\"Government violence can only do one thing and that is to bring counter-violence.  If there is no dawning of sanity on the part of the government, the dispute between the government and my people will finish up being settled in violence and by force.\"\n   The same could be said about the Boer people.  He further says:\n\"Whatever sentence Your Worship sees fit to impose upon me for the crime of which I have been convicted before this court, may he rest assured that when my sentence has been completed I will still be moved, as men are always moved by their conscience.\"\n\tI then concluded by saying, Your Honour, the ANC's fight was a fight against apartheid, against a social order in order to gain the vote.  My fight and that of the AWB is a fight to put right the problem at Vereeniging.  That will always burn in my heart no matter what I am being sentenced.  It cannot stop it.  I thank you.  That is what I said there Your Honour.  \n\tI would like to conclude with that and I would like to conclude by telling you that what we have done here, at least I and I also know my colleague here next to me did the same, was to say to you that there is not a difference between the fight of the Boers and that of the other people in front of us, which took us to Ventersdorp was the freedom of the Boer nation and the Boer people.  That will stay alive.  And if I told you that I do not recognise the current government, Your Honour, I would also like to say to you in the same breath that the previous government for the same reason was not acknowledged by me.  I thought that we could perhaps in all honesty tell you what motivates us and like my good friend here told you yesterday, I stand here for one simple reason and that is that I would like to clear my record.\n\tI am not a criminal, I never was one, but if I am being regarded as a criminal when I pleaded for my nation, then it is a crime.  And my people - if I go to bed at night I tell myself it was not I who shot people dead and killed people, it wasn't me who caused people to be bitten by dogs.  It wasn't me who tried to belittle the fight of the Boer people and to intimidate those activists.  I thank you.",

In fact my weapon was in a briefcase with my documents.  That was my briefing order to ask Mr de Klerk questions.  I did not have any weapons on me.  \n\tWhat happened that night, the AWB was not responsible for.  The AWB tried to prevent - because we were prevented from going to that meeting, people were killed by order of De la Roosa who misused the police in order for political gains.  In future, this should never happen again, that people in senior positions, when they want to promote their own political motives, use the State machinery and our security forces in order to build their political image and even go so far as to endanger peoples' lives.\n\tIn conclusion then, neither Mr Rudolph nor myself could get any  political gain - sorry, financial gain from this and that there was no motivation about personal hate and revenge in any way.  It was politically motivated and that in the end we have been convicted as criminals, without having the privileges of the criminal where they could at least enrich either one.  We did not assault people who we have been cross with or wanted to do that.  We did not even have that satisfaction of somebody who assaulted somebody else because he proved himself as being in a superior position.\n\tI leave this case in your hands.

I suppose you have been confronted in the first opportunity here that it was about real Boers, Christians who fought against a watered down compromising government, which once again has been proved in this matter.  They used the South African Police and the South African Defence Force to save themselves whilst they could not come up with a political solution and never went to the nation or the other nations and opposition who were living with them in the same country.\n\tThis was politically motivated without any serious human rights violations.  And we belong to the Boer nation which was through the Covenant of Blood River, in which we confirmed that we are bound to the God of our fathers.

As it is custom in the, customary in the political set up that meeting should take place in order to discuss that meeting with regard to Mr de Klerk's visit and to do planning.\n\tI must tell you, Your Honour, that that was in August.  On the 18th of March I was freed and released after a hunger strike of 30 days.  I had stomach problems and from time to time I could not attend those meetings.  It was a long time ago, but I do recall that amongst other things, matters were discussed, those matters which should be asked of Mr de Klerk if we could get access and how that access should be negotiated.  There was also the possibility being mentioned because we knew the National Party would use the police and how they went about things, that we foresaw problems and how to combat those problems.\n\tI know that a lot was said about the fact that the AWB had a first aid tent and equipped it.  Your Honour, prior to the Ventersdorp situation shots were fired at farmers at Goedgevonden and people were injured, but it was a practice over a number of years of the AWB to, during such meetings, have an emergency tent because we had people who handled weapons and knopkierries and batons that was planned there because that meeting at a stage had to be rounded off where I was not present.  It was to be discussed how Mr de Klerk's visit should be handled.  \n\tOne thing is for certain and that is that the leader insisted that we, unlike the other parties, should not prevent Mr de Klerk from having his meeting, that we would allow him to have his meeting and then give him a motion of no confidence.

Not all those present were AWB's and if there were some there who came there with knopkierries or as night guards that was them.  What happened there was that we lived in times of turmoil, worse than today and people had to travel long distance with weapons.  If you left your weapons at home and it got stolen, you had problems, if you left it in your car and it was stolen, you had problems, and there was a question as to whether people would be allowed to bring along their weapons.  Mr Terre'blanche insisted then that if weapons were being brought there, they should be licensed weapons because we accepted that the police would have blockades along the road.  That was the reason for the presence of the weapons there.\n\tI would like to say to you, however, even if you were to count all those weapons and put them together that appears in the court case as well and you were to look at the evidence of General Malan and then later at the summary of the magistrate, you would see that there was an arsenal brought by the police to Ventersdorp.  And if a brief were to be given that weapons were to be brought along and it is understood from that that people had prepared themselves to use those, I would like to say to you that the evening at Ventersdorp the leader of the AWB, chief leader, because there were more leaders, but the chief leader of the AWB actually man alone went out to the streets when shots rang out and he said: \"for heavens' sake do not shoot\".  For any reasonable person who could deduce from that that the AWB went to that meeting to shoot I would like to say to you that the AWB proved them wrong.",

If you will allow me I will provide you with the details at a later stage.  As regards the other people, the people who did not agree with Mr de Klerk, in that week arrangements also made by the Conservative Party and the Farmers' Crisis Action and Dr Ferdie Hartzenberg then had a meeting of the Conservative Party before Mr Terre'blanche at the town hall.  So there were many people, it was not just AWB people on the whole, but when we walked there were a whole number of people but the people marched together with the AWB with the expectation of gaining access to the hall because that was the impression that Mr Terre'blanche was supposed to leave them with after I had told him that there had been an invitation to meet with and to speak to Mr Armie Venter regarding access to the hall.\n\tI just want to say further that the AWB people were there in uniform or most of them were in uniform and I think that we accepted responsibility for those people.  The fact that some of the people who were killed, who had been wearing khaki clothes and who did not wear the signs of the AWB, should serve as an indication of who could all have been present.

            "I am not an electrical engineer but I do understand how electricity works.  Allow me then to just start at the beginning.  At the offices of the AWB, there was a person, a certain Mr Stoekie.  In the court case Mr Stoekie alleged that a discussion between the leader and another leader was heard regarding the lights which had to be switched off.\n\tI personally was confronted regarding a discussion six months later when a reporter asked me how I saw the struggle of the Boer people in future and I said that we would have to do it not from the public stage but under cover of darkness as liberation fighters do it throughout the world.  This was held against me in the court case that I was supposed to have put off the lights.  I know nothing about putting off the lights, but the man who said that he was an enemy of Mr Terre'blanche and he heard him talk to another member regarding putting off the lights, was as far as I know also an informer of the South African Police, because what had happened was that the police went to the power station and waited there for people, but as fate would have it a funeral procession from the Transkei passed by at that specific moment when the struggle was erupting and they entered Ventersdorp and when they saw these masses of white people - because you know this is the problem we have in South Africa, I hope this will disappear that white people are afraid of black people and black people are afraid of white people, and when these poor people entered Ventersdorp and they saw these masses of white people, then one of these taxis drove into a power box.  At one stage - the police were there at that stage and Mr Terre'blanche, accused number one, went there to see if he could rectify it and see why the lights were off, but that this fuse box had been knocked over and resulted in an electrical power failure.  He was unaware of this and while he was there he was found there by policemen who asked him what he was doing there and in the process arrested him.\n\tSo, if there was a calculated attempt at putting the lights off I cannot tell you, but I can tell you that there were circumstances which indicate that the knocking down of the fuse box could have been the cause of the short-circuit or power failure.\n   I can also just explain that the person who worked at the office, Mr Stoekie, was also the man, the first witness who was called by the State as an accomplice, and he testified before the magistrate in that hearing that I wanted to shoot down the helicopter of Mr F W de Klerk and that the meeting had stopped me from doing this.  While General Malan who was not in favour of me testified that no-one could have known that Mr de Klerk, that evening at Ventersdorp, would have arrived there in a helicopter.

On the contrary, in these three cases, as far as I am concerned, there was also a lot of humiliation, financial losses were, we had financial losses and that which we have done, we did in the spirit of our conscience and a deep responsibility towards our God.

Firstly, certainly there was no proof that the tarring and feathering of Professor van Jaarsveld was not a very strong political motivation, that the mere fact that Professor van Jaarsveld indicated a new direction in his position as Professor of History and which he had to do with the youth, gullible youth and to such an extent he abused the realities of the Covenant that after the attention drawn by the AWB on what was said by him, his text books were even removed from schools.\n\tOne thing is sure then, it could never have been a personal attack of revenge and that the AWB acted without substance was indeed proved by Mr van Jaarsveld's family and their legal advisors, in which they even admitted that the attack on the Vow of my forefathers was done, but also that he indeed was so far from the standpoint of the Boer people that the Security Police approached him about a paper he delivered on communism.\n\tI mention this because that mere fact also supports our political motivation very strongly.  Therefore, for political reasons we saw politically motivated that the person, Mr van Jaarsveld, tried to change history and to leave a nation disillusioned and take them away from their God and to tear them away from their vow to God, tear them away from that which was sacred to him and which comprises the biggest part of its culture. \n\tMr van Jaarsveld, his family, thought to make a personal attack on me as well as that of the other 39 tarrers and featherers.  Mr van Jaarsveld in his submission that he read to the world, used the opportunity given to him by the court by even doubting my relationship with my God.  Mr van Jaarsveld accused me also that I did not for the sake of my conscience did what I have done but that I did that in order to promote my political career in the AWB.  That in itself is proof of the fact that there is a strong political motivation.  Mr van Jaarsveld said that it was only merely politics, but in the presence of a Boer peoples' God I have to confess to you and admit that it was not only politics per se, but that there was a strong motivation because of my religion and my responsibility as a Boer to protect the dignity of my God.  Nevertheless, I do believe humbly, that I adhere to all the requirements for amnesty with regard to this specific matter.  \n\tWith regard to the weapons, I would like to draw to your attention that these weapons, that there was never any evidence that these weapons were required to in any way gain from that.  Those were not acquired and put under my control were sold for money or any other gain, those weapons were left at Witrandjiesfontein and it was left there should they be needed because of political changes, political instability, which could lead to chaos, revolution and disruption.  Those weapons were indeed buried by the AWB but we never took them out again.  They could probably still be in the fertile soil of my old family farm.  Those weapons were taken away by the Security Police when it suited them, when they wanted to stop the young, up and coming movement which could be a strong opposition to the government.  That is why Mr Moos who, without a shadow of doubt had strong ties as was also said by myself to the Security Police was sent out of the country without ever returning.\n\tI believe, humbly, that the weapons there were kept there and were not handed over to the SAP because we as political opponents of the government, could not trust that government.  In fact, we saw that government as a government who would like to change the course of history and it would like to end the sacrifices of the nation.  Therefore, my humble submission is that in that case, I adhere to all the requirements for amnesty.\n\tIn the third instance, with regard to the Battle of Ventersdorp, it is perhaps not to be disputed that it was about politics.  In that case, we certainly had the best example of when something is done by being motivated by politics.  Such a transgression, offence, could never take place if Mr de Klerk did not force himself down and he tried to gain, not the AWB.  He would look stronger and he would show, prove to the world that he would go to the Boers and that he would not give the Boers the opportunity to exercise their democratic right to place Mr de Klerk, to draw the attention to Mr de Klerk.  He believed there was a stronger person and apparently he did not care about the corpses left behind in the streets of that town. In my evidence I proved, and I think it is relevant here again, that shortly afterwards he was not again going to a place where it was just as unpopular, this time round however, Boipatong, black community.  Mr de Klerk, once again, had to leave the audience.  He once again had to flee from the public and behind him in his terrible abuse, as in Ventersdorp of the South African Police and the Defence Force, once again leave dying people behind in the streets.\n\tI believe with regard to the third application that it is simply not able to say that in this case I do not qualify for amnesty.  I, Honourable Mr Chairman, also because I am not a legal man, I perhaps at the wrong stages made applications to you which should take place, but I would once again like to point to one thing and unfortunately I have to repeat myself, I once again want to say that these cases took place during a time when the National Party of FW de Klerk ruled and was in power.   Our approach towards that government was that we indeed regarded the government as a bad government and a weak one, as party political opportunists for whom it was about own positions in most cases, as a governed without principles to which we could not trust the governance of this country, as an arrogant government who was prepared to allow people to be killed for the sake of his own honour and positions.  To allow people to be killed, people of their own nation, but also to allow people of their own security forces to be killed as long as they could prove a political point.  \n\tIn opposition to this government, the AWB stood and the AWB's political purposes were directly against the party political opportunists, which could even use power of the Roman Dutch law in order to promote themselves. \n\tI therefore believe that in all three of these cases, my application to you is justified, that I would have the opportunity and that this Committee, being given the opportunity as a law abiding citizen in a country, my beloved country, having given the best days of my life in order to maintain law and order in the South African Police as an ex policeman, who at a stage was even elected.  I was even elected to be responsible because of my talents for the safety of the State President and that of the Premier.\n\tDespite the fact that at that stage when I was a member of the unit, the guard who was responsible for the security of the Premier and the State President, my political motivation took me away from politics.  I resigned and politically, without violence, I started fighting that infamous government and to the best of my ability I, the de Klerk, Vorster and PW Botha governments, I fought.\n\tMy ideal was directly against government policy.  I was in favour of a Volksstaat where the Boer people could govern themselves in freedom.  I, in my policy, never made provision for the addiction of any nation.  The AWB policy spelt out clearly.  We were looking for political borders to give freedom to my nation and any other nation.  I wanted to lead my people to worthy, to a nation who such as in the case of the British, Germans, the Israelis, whoever.  As I saw it at the time, the Zulu, the Xhosa as well as the Venda, that policy did not give protection to the political opportunists such as de Klerk and his other politicians.  \tI was prepared to even show my disgust outside of the acts of the country, as was the case with the tarring and feathering, the illegal weapons, the Ventersdorp meeting which at a late stage all of a sudden we were not allowed to attend.  \n\tI place this application in your hands and I am grateful for this body, so that it can be recorded because history is busy to write mercilessly about the actions of all of us who were here and I would like to trust and I record it.  I would however, and I know that it is not my right to do so, I would like to make an appeal to this Committee that while this Committee - the biggest task of this Committee is to bring about reconciliation and peace but above all, truth, to ask that what happened in my case, that people coming with allegations and insults are not allowed that they, untested, give it to the press who is still in the hands of the previous government, give them the opportunity to do exactly the contrary of what this Committee wants to achieve, to write that and I refer here to Mr Desmond Thomas(sic), his report in Beeld today.\n\tIf you would like to heal, then little men such as Desmond Thompson being to lie, allow to heal and to break, instead of healing to break down and to publish irrelevant evidence as to what is actually happening in your Commission.\n\tThe TRC says today whether it accepts FW's evidence, ET attacked the TRC about tarring and feathering.  That was his main report.  He never learnt that the freedom of the press is there and that he should be allowed by the State, or he is allowed by the State in this Committee, and that he achieves the freedom or has the freedom to tell the truth.  Mr Tutu cannot be so stupid and his level of intelligence so low that what, as not to see what is relevant.  And that the tested evidence under you and Ms Patel, leading the evidence, so as not to report that but use this to, in terms of his old pattern, who could write about so many better things, still drives in and causes differences.  I will report Mr Thompson to the Media Board in the same way I have done after a media speech in Pretoria.  I would just wonder whether we couldn't come up with a mechanism that this Committee should not be used for sensation-seeking lies by people who still have their own political agendas and who still hate the Boer people, whom I belong to as was the case with the days of Mr de Klerk.  \n\tI thank you for your patience and I would like you to forgive me for having abused your time.  Perhaps it will be a good thing for the sake of future reports with regard to your amnesty committee in the press.  I thank you.",

The evidence shows that the police officer who describes his pistol as a .22 calibre is wrong.  He also denies that he said, when he took the baseball bat, 'give the thing that I can hit them with it'.\nI deny that today still. \n\tHere the court gives preference to police evidence and in this way the magistrate continues and then he says, in the second last or third last line:\n\"I do not believe that his denial is a purposeful attempt to excuse himself.  I think that the impression gained by the court as a witness, is that he would not stop to acknowledge that even if it is not in his favour.\"\n\tI believe in regard to the matter of total disclosure or full disclosure which Mr Terre'blanche, my colleague, regarding the Ventersdorp matter, I am in agreement with him.\n\tAs regards the political objectives, it is so that today we are in another time-frame but I also told you that my political motives are exactly the same.  However, in the time that we have had to deal with the new government, on numerous occasions we have seen a different approach for which I am personally very grateful.\n\tThat time at Ventersdorp we were pressed for time and we had to take action.  Mr Terre'blanche told you about the role played by the media in our denigration and which denied us the opportunity to state our case properly.  This is a tactic, not only used by the National Party, but other organisations as well and is as old as ...(indistinct) \n\tMr Desmond Thompson is a man who has been writing about politics for a long time and as was true of the National Party mouthpiece, held us up as Nazis or fascists.  Just as the same people held up black nationalists as communists, we were regarded as Nazis and fascists when we differed from them.\n\tYou were in this court yesterday, the Committee was here, I was here, but the media tells us about yesterday's events.  \n\"Rudolph and Terre'blanche wore khaki clothes.\"\nNow I would like to say, if I wore khaki clothes yesterday, then Mr Desmond Thompson was drunk.  That is the situation which we are faced with and which the press has created because when one wears khaki clothes then I am a Nazi and a fascist.

I also tried to convey to you that our struggle, a struggle of the Boers, the Boer people and nationalists will continue until we die or until we have scored a victory.  That political objective which I had at Ventersdorp, I still have today.  I had envisaged no gains, I have no political ambition except for the fact that one day somewhere, there will be a place in the sun for the Boer people and that the liberation flag, the Vierkleur, will once again fly over our country, the Transvaal.

            "Thank you Honourable Chairperson.  I will start in chronological order as the events took place.  However, before I start on the merits of, or my submissions in respect of the different events for which amnesty\nis being sought, I would however comment on the applicants' position that they have likened their position in society in a sense to that of the liberation movements.  In a sense the flip-side of that submission, Honourable Chairperson, is that neither of the applicants were subject to forced removals under the previous government.  They were not subjected to the inferior education system.  They were beneficiaries of the apartheid system in respect of the separate development policies.  There were questions - not the questions, there was the policy of job reservations and better employment opportunities and most importantly, the were not disenfranchised under the previous regime, Honourable Chairperson.  Accordingly, they had the right to mobilise and wield whatever political clout they could muster to achieve their objectives, that in fact a limited democracy reigned supreme in the country during the time in which these offences were committed.\n\tBe that as it may Honourable Chairperson, I would like to move on to the question of the application in respect of Mr van Jaarsveld.  It is my respectful submission in response to Mr Terre'blanche's submission, that he relies on certain ex post facto facts or information that has come to light in terms of the submission made by the late Mr van Jaarsveld's son, in relying on their political motivation at the time.\n\tIt is my respectful submission Honourable Chairperson that the applicant is not entitled to rely on evidence and information that came to light after the incident had in fact taken place in order to support his political motivation at the time.\n\tMy second point in respect of that incident, Honourable Chairperson, is the question of whether one is motivated by a difference and a religious dispute, whether that amounts to a political motivation in terms of our enabling legislation.  It is my respectful submission Honourable Chairperson, that it in fact does not.  The applicant has said time and time again that his attack on Mr van Jaarsveld was in fact motivated by Mr van Jaarsveld trying to change history and more importantly was to tear them, was Mr van Jaarsveld's motivation to tear them away from God which comprised the bigger part of their culture.  If that is indeed the motivation, Honourable Chairperson, where does one then draw the line?  Can one then not argue that everything in life where one, that everything in life is in fact political that it affects your culture to a greater or lesser degree.  To use an example, let's assume that under the previous government an applicant stands before us having committed an offence against someone of a different sexual orientation and his argument is that heterosexuality is a part of his culture and that is what he wanted to preserve and that is indeed then his political motivation in that he wants to support a particular way of life.  Can we then say that this is the brief of this Commission?",

So there is that political element in it.  It is not just a question of somebody who is heterosexual and somebody who is not and somebody being offended by somebody else's sexual orientation.  There is no sort of political element there whereas in this case, as the applicants have testified, they felt extremely strongly about this and they saw it as a threat, a threat to what they believed in politically, also of course religiously, but there was that political element.  And Mr Terre'blanche did concede in his argument, he said there was a political element, but I concede that there was also a large measure of religious motivation because in their ...(indistinct) it was difficult to separate the religion from the politics in that particular situation.",

            "Yes, thank you very much Mr Chairperson, I would just like to again repeat that my total political conviction rightly or wrongly is being driven by my education emotionally and my belief in the living God.  I thank you in reaction to the statement of the honourable lady, it did say that there are groupings to whom politics are of great importance.  Nobody will deny that it is a killing game politically, which took place for 600 years in England.\n\tI am referring to the Irish who are Catholics and the crown.  To a certain extent the Boers also see themselves as old testament people.  I know you may find it strange but I would like to say to you in honesty that religion, the Boers' religion, naturally and its politics are very closely related and that is why the Boer in his constitution wrote that he is dependent and that he subject to God the Trinity who is determining peoples' lives.  We believe that God determines the fate of each nation and people and in this case God was asked to determine the fate of the Boer people who were only 440 in an onslaught.  The Lord was asked not only to become involved in politics but also the war politically also, but there were negotiations between the trekkers and the Zulus but that move towards war and in that war God was asked to become part of politics and the war and he bound himself by saying that we should tell our children in years to come that God at the Blood River won this war, which was the cruellest form of political strife.\n\tIf I was not in politics, Honourable Chairperson, and if there was not an AWB, Van Jaarsveld would not have been tarred and feathered because then there would not have been a political standpoint by a body who carried this out and did not enable us to resist.  Somebody who was further from politics and somebody who would have seen the elements of politics because he involved himself in the bible in the same way that Mr van Jaarsveld said here, Mr van Jaarsveld involved himself in the history of politics.  The history is the placing on record the situation of what happened, conventions that were entered into, land being claimed and land being lost that is exactly what history is all about.  It is the placing on the record and the archiving of the political history and past with regard to the political past of the Boer people at Blood River, the historian said to the opponents of the Boer people not to trust God because he was present at Blood River.\n\tIn other words the argument of the AWB and the Trinity, that argument was taken away from the AWB if Van Jaarsveld's paper was accepted.  With the information at my disposal, I would like to say that it was the strongest political onslaught ever on the foundations of which the Boer peoples' total struggle was to be justified to the world.  If the Lord gave the victory which was asked for and whether it was the competency of the Boers there, the fact nevertheless remains that the Boers asked that God should save them and the Generals who were also the political leaders then found this victory.  Who then am I or Van Jaarsveld or those coming after him to say that it was not God who heard their, listened to their prayers.\n\tIf God is being asked to hear your prayers and he listens to them, who are you or anybody else to say \"No, God, I have asked you but I was the good and competent General\" or \"God I have asked you but Pretorius put up a lager in a very special way.  It is not about which religion, to which religion people belong, but the principle of religious freedom and the right that for one to exercise one's religion and that the Lord has heard your prayers.  That should be protected and if it is being protected, it is politics, then it is a political act being made by Parliament saying to people you have religious freedom and if then you question another person's right and that person stands up and he commits a crime, a political crime, then it brings me here before you today.  I believe more essentially this case than the other two cases in which I would like to stand up for my God, my people and my fatherland by means of the tarring and feathering of Professor van Jaarsveld.
