<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Thank you.  Mr Chairperson, I would like to call the second applicant, Mr Sibisi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Mr Sibisi, can you please stand up so you may take an oath.  Can you please give us your full names.</p>

<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">NHLANHLA JOSEPH SIBISI:</span> (Duly sworn in, states).</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a>EXAMINATION BY MR WILLS</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBISI:</span> Thank you.  Mr Sibisi, you are also applying for amnesty in respect of the murder or Mr Lombo and also in respect of an escape from custody charge.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBISI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> You have heard the evidence that Mr Motaung gave in respect of the murder of Mr Lombo.  Do you confirm that evidence in so far as it relates to your activities?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBISI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Is there anything that you would like to add as regards the incident, the killing of Mr Lombo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBISI:</span> I do not have much to add except that I would say what he said is the truth.  We were given order and we had to follow it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Thank you.  Now, if you will turn to your escape from custody charge.  Can you tell the committee the circumstances surrounding, sorry, your application for amnesty in respect of that charge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBISI:</span> You mean I have to explain about my escape?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> That is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBISI:</span> After we discovered that they are not going to give us bail ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Please wait for a moment.  We are trying to...</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBISI:</span> After we failed to get bail, after trying for so many times, we decided that we should find a way to escape from prison.  So I use to be ill for some times, I could not get out of the house or the room and I smeared some blood on my private parts as if I was bleeding and in prison they thought I had a problem, stomach problem.  So they took me, bladder problem, and they took me for and then they took me into the prison hospital and I was kept there until the day when we were supposed to appear at the Supreme Court for the first time.  Where I was terrible ill that I could not even appear in front of the magistrate at court.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a>	I was taken in an ambulance, MBA ambulance and was taken to Edendale Hospital.  I did not succeed in the first attempt, trying to escape.  I was kept at the hospital and I was kept there for a month and after a month I managed to escape.  I tried to use the telephone and was showed a phone outside, but it was not working and I was taken to a nurses home to use the telephone and I decided I will that telephone then and use that opportunity to escape as well.  That is how I succeeded to escape.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> After you escaped where did you go?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBISI:</span> I went to Imbalie at unit 13.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> I want you to tell the committee exactly where you went in the following days and where you ended up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBISI:</span> I slept at unit 13.  On the following day they took me by car to Durban.  In Durban one of the ANC workers took me to Chesterville one house.  That is where I stayed with some other comrades and Sipho Motaung arrived at that particular place and we were taken.  We were ten in number and three men who were ANC members came to take us.  Those were MK soldiers from exile.  They took us to Swaziland and they gave us money and food which they bought.  They also gave us directions.  They told us that we are going to arrive in Swaziland and go to the UN offices and that is where we are going to be given directions as to how we are going to skip the country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a>	After that we were taken to a refugee camp and preparations were made that we were supposed to leave for Zambia.  We flew from Swaziland to Zambia.  In Zambia we spent about a month.  After that we went to Tanzania and we were trained in Tanzania up to the date where I returned back to the country in 1994.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> On your return you were integrated into the National Peace Keeping Force in Koeberg.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBISI:</span> Yes, I worked with the NPKF, National Peace Keeping Force, in Cape Town.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And you remained there until you were arrested in respect of this matter in August 1994?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBISI:</span> I was not arrested in Cape Town.  The NPKF was disbanded in Cape Town and we were taken to Bloemfontein.  In Bloemfontein we had to short listed and they combined all the armed forces in South Africa and they took me to Zeerust in the North West Province.  That is where I was arrested in August and I was arrested for murder and escape.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Now, prior to the incident where Mr Lombo was killed, did you receive any form of training in military matters?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBISI:</span> Yes, I did in 1989.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And who was responsible for that training?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBISI:</span> Sipho Motaung was responsible.  However, he was not the one in charge, because in most cases Mandla was seen to be the one who was in charge and also Buyani Madladla, who has passed away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> You made an affidavit in December in respect of this application.  Do you confirm the contents of that affidavit?  December 1995.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBISI:</span> Yes, it is the truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson, committee persons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR WILLS</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Mr Sibisi, the two escapes, that is the attempt as well as the successful one, were you aided by your organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBISI:</span> I did not understand that very well.  Can you put it clear please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> In both the attempt to escape as well as the successful escape, were you aided by your organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBISI:</span> Yes, it did help me.  However, the person who was supposed to pick me in hospital did not come to pick me up and I realised if I have to wait for him, I cannot escape.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Who was this person who was to fetch you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBISI:</span> I will be making a mistake if I say I knew his name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Is that all the assistance that was to be given to you by the organisation in the escape?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBISI:</span> That was not the only help that I got from the organisation.  It also helped me to skip the country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Yes, I mean escaping out of jail.  You did not tell this committee as to the role that your organisation played in your escape.  You just told us that you escaped and you left and you went abroad?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBISI:</span> We planned the whole escape with Mandla and Sipho while in prison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> What was the plan about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBISI:</span> As I have explained, I pretended as if I were ill.  In that way we knew that they were not going to be able to have the necessary medical help that I needed so they will have to take me out of prison into a hospital and I knew that I will get a chance to escape.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Now, when you were in prison with this escape in your mind, was their communication between yourself and Mandla?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBISI:</span> He use to visit in prison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Now, when you were told of the operation and you accompanied applicant number one, in your own mind what did you think the killing of Lombo would assist you with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBISI:</span> Firstly, I will say that I was not happy about the killing, but the way the situation was and also because it was a question of following an order, I did not see any way we could use to fulfil the mission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> To fulfil the mission, what mission?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBISI:</span> I mean the killing or the shooting of Lombo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Did you know or were you told the reason why you had to kill him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBISI:</span> Yes, I knew the reason why we had to kill him, but I did not ask many questions with that regard, because I was told what to do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Now, I am after those reasons.  Tell us now.  Tell us those reasons that you knew.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBISI:</span> What I knew is that Lombo, he was a warlord on the Inkatha side and most of the attacks where families were killed and properties burnt, Lombo was also in front of such attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Did you know this personally or were you told?</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBISI:</span> I knew him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Now, was he a, was he ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> I  think there is a correction that needs to be done.  The witness said I did not know him personally and the translation came through as "I knew him".</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Let us put this right.  Did you know Lombo yourself, personally.  Thank you for the correction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBISI:</span> No, I did not know him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> So ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you know of him?  Had you heard about him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBISI:</span> Yes, I was told about him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Now, were you told by your commanders or people who gave you the order as to what his death would do to the organisation or to the community?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBISI:</span> We were not going to achieve anything or anything that I was going to achieve personally.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Anything that you were going to achieve for the organisation or for the community?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBISI:</span> The community was going to benefit from his death, because what I heard was that they could not even organise in that particular area, the ANC members.  If they happened to have a meeting they were going to be killed.  One other thing is that the community was pleased if he will, when he was removed even if there were some further attacks things began to be calm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Well, did the, well, you said things began to be calm, but did the violence and the killings and the damage of property in the Edendale area stop after the death of Lombo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBISI:</span> It did not stop or it was not that calm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Will have arrived at, actually, his death made things worse in the Edendale area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBISI:</span> I will not disagree with you, because I do not know what is the basis of that statement, but I know that after his elimination many people were saved, because what I was told is that he was the one who instigated most of the attacks.  Even if there were some other warlords we left behind, but he was the one who was considered as a high profile warlord.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  No further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY ADVOCATE MPSHE</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR MIRANDA:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Sibisi, had you been involved in any other murders before this one of Lombo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBISI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR MIRANDA:</span> So this was your first one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBISI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR MIRANDA:</span> Do you know why it was chosen to murder Mr Lombo at Joshua Doore and not somewhere else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBISI:</span> I could not ask from the commanders why they choose that particular place, Joshua Doore area, where we had to kill him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR MIRANDA:</span> In your affidavit you refer to a gentleman known as Buyani Madladla.  Was he your senior?</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBISI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR MIRANDA:</span> And was the one that gave you the instruction to murder Mr Lombo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBISI:</span> Instructions came from Mandla.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR MIRANDA:</span> And if I understand your evidence correctly, you took the instructions, did not question the instructions and acted accordingly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBISI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR MIRANDA:</span> Hypothetically, if the instructions from Mr Mandla were that you kill a personal friend of yours or somebody that you knew quite well, would you still have carried that out without questioning the instructions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBISI:</span> An order is an order.  There is not much that I was going to ask, it means I was going to do it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR MIRANDA:</span> How did you feel after you shot Mr Lombo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBISI:</span> You mean how I felt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR MIRANDA:</span> Yes, how did you feel after you shot Mr Lombo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBISI:</span> I felt relief, because I did what I was supposed to do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR MIRANDA:</span> And did Mr Lombo say anything before you shot him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBISI:</span> I did not say anything to him or discuss anything with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR MIRANDA:</span> And what was his facial expression just before you shot him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBISI:</span> I will be lying if I say I managed to notice his facial expressions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR MIRANDA:</span> Mr Sibisi, would you have applied for amnesty if you were not recharged for the murder of Lombo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBISI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR MIRANDA:</span> No further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MIRANDA</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> No re-examination Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Although I had intended to take the short adjournment a little later, it seems to me this would be a convenient stage before we get onto the next.  We will take the short adjournment now.</p>
