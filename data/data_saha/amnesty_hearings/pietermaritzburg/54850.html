<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>CHAIRMAN:  Before we commence with the proceedings this morning for the benefit of victims, dependents and relatives of victims, I would like to inform them that we have with us two representatives of the RNR Committee, namely Ms Sitanda Msomi and Nomsa Gumede.  They are here to render such assistance as they can to the relatives of people who were victims or their dependents.    You will find them in the hall if you need their assistance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a>	Mr Brink, is Mr Jassat here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Mr Chairman, I haven't see him. I was looking for him to have a discussion with him, but I haven't seen him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Is Mrs Jama present?  Does she know whether her attorney is coming this morning?   Are we ready to proceed with Mr Madlala now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Mr Chairman, I saw yesterday that the application form of Mr Madlala had been distributed to you.  I assisted him in completing it yesterday afternoon during the lunch break and it contains all the basic information necessary.  Could I then please ask that Mr Madlala be sworn in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> s s</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR BANADE:</span> Mr Madlala, is it correct that you are applying for amnesty in the case of the murder on Mr Jama in February 1991?</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> Yes, that is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR BANADE:</span> Could you please proceed to give us some of your</p>

<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a>MR BANADE	83	MR MADLALA</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a>personal background details.  Firstly I would like to know from you on which date you were born?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> I was born on the 4th June 1965.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR BANADE:</span> Where were you born?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> I was born in Elandskroon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR BANADE:</span> And how far did you get at school?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> I passed my Std 8 in 1983.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR BANADE:</span> And what did you do after school, what kind of employment did you take up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> I was working for a certain construction company. We were building houses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR BANADE:</span> During January 1988 you joined the Police Force.  Could you just inform us as to the circumstances at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> During that time we were staying at Nada, at Chief Shiyabante Zondi's place.   Because there was another gentleman known by the name of Lawrence Zuma.  During that time Chief Shiyabante Zondi told us that we should join the Police Force.  During those days he took us to Maroa House near Edendale.  There we were asked details about ourselves and we gave our details and we were all members of the IFP.  After that we went back home.  We stayed at home for about a week and after a week we were told that we were supposed to go for our training.  We left by buses to the training centre.  It was in Cape Town at Koeberg.  We left by buses.  We were all members of the IFP.  There was no one belonging to the ANC.  When we arrived there we were put in groups and we were taught lots of orders and laws and they explained all of them to us, that if you arrest someone who has broken the law you must do this and this and then afterwards at about past 11 we were taken to march.  After two weeks</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a>1A - 11.2	after/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a>MR BANADE	84	MR MADLALA</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a>after we arrived in Cape Town, one member came from Maritzburg from a Security Branch.  That member was Mr Webb.  Mr Webb came to Cape Town by helicopter.  When he arrived there he told us that things were bad at Maritzburg.  People were killed and those people were IFP members who were killed.  We were shown video tapes and we saw people who were being necklaced by tyres and we saw houses were burnt down and people were killed.  We saw all this in a video tape.  And all those people who were being killed were IFP members.  Then we were told that we were supposed to finish our training soon so that we go back and fight UDF and ANC and we were told that UDF were members of the ANC, or they were sent by ANC that they must overthrow the Government.  We were told that we must come back to Pietermaritzburg and kill everyone who belonged to UDF or ANC and we were given guns.  We were taught how to shoot and we were taught how to march as well. </p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a>	After six weeks we came back from Cape Town to Maritzburg.  When we arrived in Maritzburg we were put at Umbali Railway Hostel.  We didn't stay there that long, we were taken to Oriep(?).  There was a huge riot station there.  That's where we were taken.  We arrived there and Captain Eugene Terblanche was the one who welcomed us.  He told us that since we were from Cape Town we were supposed to work here in Pietermaritzburg like we were taught in Cape Town.  We mustn't be scared of anything and we must harass ANC, and if it comes to a push we must kill them.  We mustn't be scared because all those cases were going to be over.  He, Mr Terblanche, was going to put those cases aside.  And we were allocated to secure IFP prominent people or to safeguard those houses.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a>1A - 11.2	After/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a>MR BANADE	85	MR MADLALA</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a>After that we were stopped doing that and now we were given police vans.  All these things were happening and when we were meeting people who were meeting ANC sheets we were supposed to kill them or to harass them.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a>	It was like nothing.  Also we were working at Hammersdale and we were killing people there and after a person has been killed, Captain Eugene Terblanche was the one who was there first before anyone could be there.  We also worked in Greytown, Richmond, doing the same job.  And also here in Maritzburg, also in C-Vale. </p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a>	On the 24th February we received a message that we must go and safeguard a meeting.  That was an ANC meeting.  It was going to occur at Noshesi area.  We took a police van, we went there and at Noshesi.  When we arrived there we found supporters of ANC and they were marching and singing, toyi-toyi and we realised that as they were singing and marching they were also naming IFP members and we go angry at that because we were IFP members and we didn't agree with their songs.  That's where we started as well toyi-toying and then other people who came to see Mr Harrington, who was the guy who was looking after the group which we were working at.  They told him that what we were doing they didn't like it.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a>	Mr Harrington told us that we must stop doing that and he told us that the ANC wasn't happy.  The meeting went on.  After that meeting we left Noshesi, we passed Nateni.  When we arrived at Dambuza, just before we arrived at the railway lines, we saw a group of boys.  If I am not mistaken they were 15.  All those boys who were there they had ANC T-shirts.  Some of the T-shirts had just President Mandela's photograph.  Some of them Sisulu's.  After that I saw a car</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a>1A - 11.2	stop/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a>MR BANADE	86	MR MADLALA</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a>stop and Erasmus got out from that car together with Mr Harrington and they said to us we must go and search those boys.  We went, all of us, no one remained at the van.  We all went to the boys.  We told them to stand up;  we started searching them.  When we were searching them, the one I was searching, when I asked him his surname he told me he was Mkhize.  There was no conflict between me and him because Mbongeni disrupted me.  He told others that these policemen, we must shoot them and we must kill them like we killed the IFP people at Shange.  When I heard that this boy is saying this, I got angry because I remembered that there were a group of IFP people who were killed at Shange.  Now I told Harrington, I said to him, here's this guy now confessing that he's the one who was involved at Mbongeni's killing.  Now we realised that he was hard and then Erasmus and Harrington arrested him.  They put him at the back of the van.  Harrington came with us inside the van, at the back of the van, and we didn't close the back door, and we were ready for any action.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a>	When Harrington got at the back of the van we went to Georgetown.   When we arrived at Georgetown Mbongeni was busy screaming, asking where he was being taken.  Erasmus stopped the van and then he came at the back.  He started harassing Mbongeni.  He hit Mbongeni.  He told Mbongeni to keep quiet.  After that he asked us what we wanted to do or where we wanted to go.  We explained to him that it was now late and we were about to go back home.  It was fine for him if he can take us back home and take others who were supposed to go to work.  That's what he did.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a>	When we left Georgetown we were still with Mr Harrington.  He wasn't at the front, he was in the back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a>1A - 11.2	He/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a>MR BANADE	87	MR MADLALA</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a>He started choking Mbongeni by his belt.  At that time the van was mobile and we were busy asking him, are you the one who wants to kill us, the IFP members, why do you want to kill us?  There were only a few people who didn't know that we were IFP members, even though we were special constables.  We travelled and Mr Jama was being assaulted, Harrington was choking him using his belt.  That's where I saw a diary.  This diary had names.  Names of the people, IFP members.  There was a name Mbalazi Vezi.  Mbalazi Vezi according to my knowledge was an IFP prominent member at Richmond.  And there were also names of the houses which were supposed to be burnt. </p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a>	At that time Harrington was asking what was on the diary, was asking Mr Dhlamini, who was another member who  was arrested together with me, even though he has now been released.  What I cannot tell you is that I don't know what happened to the diary eventually, because I was sitting at the back of the van and I was holding the door.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a>	We arrived to Elandskop.  We stopped somewhere at Elandskop at Gqwanamu near the bottle store.  That bottle store belonged to Mr Gqinamu.  Harrington and Mr Erasmus and Mr Dhlamini, they got off the van.  Immediately after they got off Mr Jama tried to grab the gun from Mr Dhlamini.  He couldn't and Mr Harrington caught him. </p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a>	When he caught him he came with him back to the van and we put him at the back of the van alone;  we closed the back of the van.  Erasmus now told us that he was thirsty, he needed something to drink, something cold.  We told them that we didn't have money, but we can go and buy cooldrink for them at Mr Bengu's store.  We took the van;  we left them there.  Mr Dhlamini was also there at the back of the</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a>1A - 11.2	van/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a>MR BANADE	88	MR MADLALA</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a>van.  We went to the shop, we took the drink, we came back.  We travelled about 2kms from the bottle store to the area where we left Harrington and Mr Erasmus.  When we got back we gave them the cooldrink.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a>	At that moment Mr Erasmus said we must kill Mr Jama.  As he was saying this, all of us police constables, we wanted to kill Mr Jama because Mr Jama was an ANC man and also he confessed that he was there when IFP members were killed.  So we all agreed that he must be killed.  No one refused or denied that.  All of us, we agreed that he must be killed.  And then Mr Bengu said he is going to show us the place where we can kill Mr Jama so that they don't discover his body soon.  We got into the van.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a>	Mr Bengu and Mr Erasmus got in at the front of the van so that he can show Mr Erasmus where to stop where we can kill Mr Jama.  We left that bottle store for about 5km and then we turned to a bush nearby.  We travelled in the bush and then we stopped somewhere.  When we stopped there Mr Harrington took Mr Jama out.  When they got outside Jama fell and then he started running.  Mr Harrington ran after him.  I ran after them too.  We were trying to catch Mr Jama, myself and Mr Harrington.  That's when Mr Harrington took out his gun and aim at Jama.  At that time he wanted to give me the gun that I must shoot Jama.  Then Harrington said no, don't be a fool.  If you kill this person using this gun when they discover this body they will discover the bullet and they will realise that it was our gun that shot him.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a>	Jama ran and Mr Harrington caught him.  When he caught him, Mr Harrington had this belt, the one that he was using at the back of the van.  Now he caught him where Jama fell</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a>1A - 11.2	and/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a>MR BANADE	89	MR MADLALA</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a>and there were stones and rocks.  Jama fell and Mr Harrington fell on top of Jama and then he started choking him using that belt.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a>	Later Mr Jama couldn't move at all.  Mr Harrington said to Mr Dhlamini, Mr Dhlamini must give me his gun because Mr Dhlamini had a (indistinct) gun and he said to me I must shoot Mr Jama.  I told Mr Harrington that no, I can't do that because he is already dead.  There is no need for me to shoot him.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a>	Mr Harrington said no, it might happen that he is just unconscious and he can regain consciousness and he can name us.  That's when I shot Mr Jama.  Of course I had this will of killing Mr Jama.  Because I wanted him to die as well, to follow those people whom he killed.  It was IFP members;  that's when I shot him.  Mr Harrington took branches from the tree and put those branches on top of Mr Jama's body.  We left.   Mr Harrington was at the back of the van.  He had a branch with him and he was wiping the wheels of the van so that people cannot realise that it has mud.  It has been somewhere in the bushes.  Mr Harrington got off the back of the car when we got to the main road and when we arrived at the first stop we stopped.  That's where I was supposed to get off.  Mr Bengu and Mr Dhlamini as well. </p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a>	We got off and Mr Harrington got off and told us that now that we have finished what we have done, we mustn't tell this to anyone.  Whatever happened belonged to just us.  We've killed this person who did all these things at KwaShane and who is also an ANC member.  Then they left, Mr Harrington and Mr Venter. </p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a>	After that we were supposed to be off and we were supposed to go back to work after a day.  When we arrived </p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a>1A - 11.2	at/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a>MR BANADE	90	MR MADLALA</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a>at work that it wasn't all of us, and I didn't even think that maybe some of them were arrested and we went to David's house in Church Street, Maritzburg and they told me that we killed someone and I denied that at first because I didn't know at that time that there was any of us who has been arrested and I denied everything.  Then they showed me a statement and they told me that there's a statement.  Erasmus has already made a statement.  When I saw the statement that's when I realised that Mr Erasmus and Mr Harrington are now pushing the case to me.  Now they are shifting everything to me.  That's when I gave the police statement, another statement.  Even though those two statements were looking similar, but they were not the same until we appeared in court and we were sentenced. </p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a>	When we were sentenced my sentence and Mr Harrington's sentence was the same sentence, eight years, eight years, and Mr Erasmus was six years.   We went to prison. </p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">(COMMENCEMENT OF TAPE 1B:</span> ) ... sentence has now gone up.  Mine is now 12 years and Mr Harrington is 18, Erasmus is now 12.  That was the end.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR BANADE:</span> Mr Madlala, just one last question.  I would just like to hear from you if you knew Mr Jama in a personal capacity?</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> No.  I only met Mr Jama on that day when he told us that he was involved in the killings of Inkatha people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR BANADE:</span> Mr Chairman, that is then the evidence in chief.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR BANADE</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Mr Chairman, members of the Committee, this witness will be questioned by Ms Thabethe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a>CROSS-EXAMINED BY MS THABETHE</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a>1B - 11.2	CROSS</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a>MS THABETHE	91	MR MADLALA</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINED BY MS THABETHE:</span> Mr Madlala, when you were told that you are supposed to go and safeguard the ANC meeting when you knew that you were IFP members, you didn't refuse to go there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> No, we didn't because our job was to safeguard, we were supposed to safeguard every area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> But you were told that if you see ANC people you must kill them or harass them.  So in other words, when you left for that meeting you knew that you were going to harass them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> There was no purpose at all.  But if we had a chance we were going to use that chance.   And also we were making sure that if we were doing all this harassment and killing we were not doing them in front of everyone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> How many were you in the van after the meeting when you left the meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> I think we were eight.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> How many were sitting in front of the van?</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> When we left the meeting only three people were at the front, Frans Erasmus and Mr Harrington and another guy who was white, I don't remember his last name.   It was 1-ton van.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> When you arrived there and saw this 15 group of boys and where Mr Jama was there, you stopped there and then you decided to search these people.  When they were searching Mr Jama, where were you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> I was busy searching the one that I mentioned that he said his name was Mkhize.  And then that's when I realised that there was one among them who was Mr Jama and who was very stubborn.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Are you saying you saw Mr Jama refusing to be</p>

<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a>MS THABETHE	92	MR MADLALA</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a>be searched?  </p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> According to Mr Erasmus, when he refused to be searched they arrested him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> That's not quite correct, isn't it?  Wasn't the evidence that he refused to be searched, two constables held him so he could be searched and that he then was searched.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> I can't say he didn't refuse because he was stubborn at that time.  Even when they arrested him he was really stubborn.  He didn't want to go.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> When Mr Erasmus was searching Mr Jama you saw this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> As I told you before, I was busy searching Mr Mkhize, but I did see Mr Erasmus searching Mr Jama and I saw that nothing was received from Mr Jama.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> When you were at the van, you said you saw a diary.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> Yes, that's true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Where was that diary from?  Because you saw them searching Mr Jama and they couldn't find a thing from Mr Jama.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> I didn't see where it came from, but I saw the diary in Mr Harrington's hand and I saw a name belonging to an Inkatha member, Mr Vizi and he was an IFP and a very prominent leader.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> You were inside the van but you didn't see where the diary came from.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> We were many at the back of the van so I couldn't see where it came from.   Mr Harrington was busy choking Mr Jama.  That's when I started seeing the diary.  How he got hold of the diary I don't know, but what I heard</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a>1B - 11.2	is/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a>MS THABETHE	93	MR MADLALA</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a>is that Mr Dhlamini said there is a diary and it is from Mr Jama's pocket and inside the diary there are names belonging to IFP members. </p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> In other words, you didn't see when they were actually searching him, but you just saw the diary.</p>

<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> When you arrived at the bush you said Mr Harrington told Mr Erasmus that he mustn't shoot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> Yes, that's what I said.  Because they were scared that the ballistic tests will reveal that the gun belonged to them, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Why did you shoot him?  Were you not scared of the ballistic test?</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> I knew that if you were using a "pump" gun it wasn't easy for anyone to discover whose gun it was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> In other words, you were not scared while Mr Harrington was scared?</p>

<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Then why did you shoot him if you thought he was dead?</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> I just shot him because we already talked that it might happen he just lost concsciousness, he can regain consciousness.</p>

<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> Yes, it was only one van that we were travelling in at that time, because the other vans had driven off the scene of the meeting, ANC meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> You said also in your evidence that Mr Jama confessed that he was there when IFP members were killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a>You heard Mr Harrington giving evidence didn't you, and he made no mention of Mr Jama saying anything of that sort.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> As I have come before Commission to ask for amnesty, I have come to say what happened and I don't even have to think about what happened because I know it for a fact.  I told Mr Harrington this is what Mr Jama said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Were you interpreting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> I told Mr Harrington that Jama has just made this statement to the effect that they must kill us in the same manner that they killed the IFP people at KwaShange.  That's how I put it when I told Mr Harrington.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> And you made a statement, you remember, to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> Yes, I do remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> You told us what happened when Mr Jama was killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> Yes, I do remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Why didn't you tell us about Mr Harrington hitting Mr Jama's head against the stone?</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> It is possible that if I remember well, I think I did mention that.  I did make mention that that happened, because even in court I did say that Mr Harrington committed that or did that.</p>

<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> Yes, I said that at the time that he was throttling him, they both fell on top of the rocks and he continued hitting his head on the rocks until such time as Mr Jama was still.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> You did not say that today, Mr Madlala.</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> I thought I had made mention of that, that at the time that he was continuing to throttle him with his belt and when he wasn't moving it was after he had hit him on the rocks and at the same time throttling him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> How many times did Mr Harrington hit Mr Jama's head against the rocks?</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> It was quite several times because he kept on throttling him and hitting him against the rock and he kept on lifting him and hitting  him against the rock, and at that time Mr Jama was moving until such time that he was still.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> He was lifting him up and banging his head down against the rocks until he was still?</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> You had been ... that the ANC was no longer an illegal organisation, because you were sent to protect them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> No, at that time we had not been told because had we been told that the ANC had a right to voice itself we wouldn't have gone there, but we were told that we were supposed to go there.  We were not told that the ANC had been unbanned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Are you serious about that, Mr Madlala?</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> I had absolutely no knowledge of that at this time because we didn't even listen to the radio or read</p>

<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> And your job was to guard the meeting that was addressed by Mr Harry Gwala.</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> That is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> You were guarding that meeting weren't you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> That is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> And are you seriously suggesting we should believe that you thought the ANC was an unlawful organisation on that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> I'll put it this way.  It is true that I did not know that the ANC had been unbanned at that time.  We were still using the same methods that we were taught and I was still continuing to use the very same  methods because at that time I believed what I was doing was right, I knew that the ANC was our enemy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Mr Madlala, I just want to know which came first.  Mr Jama was submitted to quite an extensive search by the special constables, and at the same time he made utterances to the effect that the police had to be killed like the killing which had happened at KwaShange.  Now what came first?  Was he first submitted to the search and thereafter made utterances about the KwaShange incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> What took place first of all was that he was searched and he only uttered that at the time that he had already been searched.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> To whom were the utterances directed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> He was addressing the people that he was with, that is the group, but he was looking at Mr Mkhizi directly.  That's when I heard him saying it because I had just searched Mr Mkhizi at that time and I conveyed the message to Mr Harrington that this person was making these</p>

<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a>MS KHAMPEPE	98	MR MADLALA</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a>utterances. </p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> If I am not mistaken, I heard Mr Harrington state that he found the diary and he found the diary when him and yourself were searching the deceased whilst he was in the back of the van and that diary was found in the pocket of the T-shirt that the deceased was wearing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> Yes, I would like to explain.  When they searched at first they didn't get anything on the body of the deceased.  When I first saw the diary it was in the possession of Mr Harrington and Mr Dhlamini and that was inside the van and at that time I didn't touch Mr Jama because I was holding the doors of the van and they were busy harassing, assaulting and doing all sorts of things to Mr Jama.  I never even conducted a search.  Even the first time, I did not search him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> ... what was contained in the diary, was it Mr Harrington or Mr Dhlamini?</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> The person who was reading what was inside the diary was Dhlamini because Dhlamini knew the leaders of the IFP because he is also a member of the IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> ... what was contained in the diary written on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> The diary was written in Zulu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> So Mr Dhlamini was interpreting the contents of the diary to Mr Harrington.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> That is true.   Mr Dhlamini was a matriculant, so he did not have a problem speaking to Mr Harrington.</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Thank you Mr Madlala.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Can you tell us why that diary was thrown out of the van?</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> I wouldn't know.  As I had already explained</p>

<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a>CHAIRMAN	99	MR MADLALA</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a>that I did not even see them throwing the diary out of the window and after that I did not continue to ask as to where the diary was.  Even when they threw it, maybe Mr Harrington threw it together with Mr Dhlamini because I only saw it when they were having it in their hands.  As to where it ended I have no idea. </p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> When did you learn that the ANC was no longer banned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> I only knew that after the case and it is after quite some time that we had been convicted, that's only when I got wind of the fact that the ANC had been unbanned as well as that other organisations were also unbanned and people could join an organisation of their choice.</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Do I understand you to mean that if you had known  on that day that the ANC had been unbanned, you would not have done what you did?</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> Yes, I could say that I wouldn't go there because I would have known that there were negotiations and people were free to join an organisation of their choice and I believe that Mr Jama could be alive today if I was as clear as I was after the case and that negotiations were taking place and I only knew that after I could read newspapers and listen to the radio to find out what was happening in the outside world.</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> To be specific, you would not have taken part in the assault on Mr Jama if you had known at the time that the ANC had been unbanned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> Yes, I can say that, I would not have taken part because all this that took place is because of the indoctrination that we went through especially with regard to the matter of KwaShange massacre, but had I know that now</p>

<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a>the organisations had been unbanned, I would have realised that at the Police Force we were being used and the aim that they had to fulfil they wanted to use us to fulfil that aim</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a>so that there wouldn't be any negotiations. </p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Mr Madlala, this group of young boys were harassed in the sense that you stopped them and searched them but what I don't understand is, why did it not stop there?  Why did you single out the deceased and put him into the van?</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> There were other people who were searched.  I could say not that all of them were searched, because Mr Jama was resisting and he was stubborn, he didn't want to be searched, so I could say that the search didn't continue to the other members of the group.  It stopped when Jama was resisting to be searched and attention was focused on him at that point and then especially when he made these utterances that the police should be killed in the very same manner that the IFP was killed.  And when I told Mr Harrington I wanted him to know that here is another person who was making an admission.  Because it was a usual occurrence for us at the office to talk about ANC members and how to harass them as IFP members.  We were always told that we should deal with them accordingly whenever we came across them, especially because we knew that the cases were never dealt with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Why was the deceased in particular singled out and put into the van?</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> I think Jama was taken because he was resisting the search and he was fighting and he made this utterance.  I think that's what made him to be singled out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Why was he killed?</p>

<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> He was killed because he was one of the people involved during the IFP massacre.</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Had he not been so involved are you saying that he would not have been killed, according to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> I wouldn't be positive on that aspect.  But when he spoke or uttered these words we were even more aggressive with him and we just wanted to torture, assault and harass him as a member of the ANC, and probably would have released him later on just like the other ANC people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> The deceased's alleged involvement in the previous killing of the IFP supporters is given such prominent by yourself in your evidence and yet neither Mr Harrington nor Mr Erasmus referred to it ... (CHANGE-OVER TO TAPE 2A)</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> I think it didn't receive prominent as far as they were concerned because it was something that we always spoke about.  Mr Harrington and Erasmus themselves, especially all the people who were inside the van, they knew that we should get the ANC people who committed the massacre or who were involved in the massacre.</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> You heard yesterday Mr Harrington said he could not even recall at all you telling him that the deceased says that he was involved in the previous killing of IFP people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> Yes, I did hear him giving testimony.  I think it is because it is a long time since it happened, probably he had forgotten.  I spoke to him in English.</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> With regard to the throttling of the deceased and the banging of his head on the rocks, it happened while all of you were there, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> Yes, that is true, because from the time that</p>

<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a>he was taken out - from the time that the van was being driven, Mr Harrington started throttling Jama whilst we were inside the van together with the others who were in the van.  They kept on participating in the assault and when we got to the forest we were all standing when Mr Jama was being hit against the rocks. </p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> I am not sure Mr Erasmus's evidence with regard to the banging of the head is concerned.   I am not sure what his evidence was, but would it surprise you if he were to say that he did not see that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> I would agree with Erasmus because immediately after they told him not to shoot or use that gun, it was quite a distance.  Erasmus was not near us.  He was quite a distance from the scene of the incident.  I would agree with you if he says he did not see what had actually happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> I thought you said it occurred while all of you were there, which was my previous question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> Yes, we were present at that time, but Erasmus was a distance because he was not involved in quite a lot of harassment.  He only slapped him across the face and he sort of distanced himself thereafter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Mr Erasmus's evidence he gave us yesterday talks about wanting to shoot Jama and then says "Harrington en Madlala is agter hom aan.

<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> When this happened, when Mbongeni tried to run, when Mr Harrington was trying to get him out of the van that's when Jama tried to stand up and run and that's where Erasmus pulled out his gun.

<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> I did not say that.  Erasmus did not run after Mr Jama.  Maybe he might have come thereafter.  What I remember is that I was No 2 after Harrington.</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> ... want Mr Erasmus not to be so stupid as to shoot, where were they?  Were they not busy chasing the deceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> At the time it was when Mr Jama was getting off from the ground and trying to run.  That is when Mr Harrington hadn't yet followed Mr Jama.  Maybe Mr Jama ran for about 500 metres before Harrington decided to give chase.  It could be a distance from here up to the houses that I am pointing.  It is only then that we decided to run after Jama.  Because when Jama was running, he was running haphazardly to show that he was now powerless and he could not run further.</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> It should perhaps be indicated that the houses that he is pointing out was somewhere between 100 and 150 metres away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> I do understand that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> When was this massacre of the IFP people, how long before this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> It was just before we came across Jama.</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Months or weeks or days?</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> If I remember quite well, I think it was only four weeks and after that four weeks that's where we came across Jama.</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Do you in fact know when the ANC was unbanned?</p>

<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> So you didn't know whether that massacre was after the unbanning or before the unbanning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> No, I really would not know whether those people were killed after the unbanning or before the unbanning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> You heard about the unbanning during or after your court case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> I only heard of it during the case immediately after we got bail, because the case was remanded for about a year.</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> ... did you hear of it then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> Yes, I heard that it had been unbanned and there was going to be a new government and a government of democracy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Even after you heard that, did the killing of IFP members or ANC members, vice versa, did it stop then or did it still continue?</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> I personally stopped during that time.  Even now in gaol we are with other members of the ANC and we are living harmoniously.</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> In gaol you are living harmoniously, and outside, what's the position, do you know or don't you know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> Well, let me just relate this instance, because when we went to the Truth Commission for the first time when they were discussing the Seven Day War, and when I was going to Ashdown to show them where the police shot people, we discovered that people in Mpumuza were now also living in peace, that is the IFP members as well as the ANC members, there was relative calm in the area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Mr Madlala, I am very perturbed about your evidence about what I think is an important event which led</p>

<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a>MS KHAMPEPE	105	MR MADLALA</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a>to the death of the deceased, Mr Jama, and that is the search of the group of boys that you found next to Dambuza.  The evidence of both Mr Erasmus and Harrington was to the effect that the whole group was subjected to an extensive search.  In fact, only one person resisted the search and that was Mr Jama, which led to him being put into the van and your evidence or statement to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission which you have submitted also to this Committee on page 7 at paragraph 25 you yourself says that:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a>"On our way back to Dambuza area we met a group of about 15 boys including Mbongeni Jama, whom we searched after stopping the vehicle, but we found nothing from their persons".</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a>You have now changed that and you are saying not all of these persons were searched.  Now which evidence are we supposed to believe from you, Mr Madlala?</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> The people that we searched, I don't know why they said they were all searched, because according to my recollection we were not able to search all of them because the people were many in number, much more than us, and if I recollect quite well, the people were not all searched because Jama at that time was resisting the search and the attention was diverted from the other group to Jama.</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Why did you then write in your statement that you searched and you did not indicate that you did not search the whole group.  Your statement says that you searched the group.  It is your statement and not Mr Harrington and Mr Erasmus's statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> Yes, it is true, we did search the group, but not all of them were searched, not all of them.  We did</p>

<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a>search a certain number, but the attention was diverted later on because at that time Mr Jama was resisting the search.  And at that time the attention was shifted from the group as a whole to Mr Jama.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Why is that section not contained in the document that you submitted, Mr Madlala?</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> Maybe there is a problem that I can put in this manner.  It is difficult for me to give the statement to a number of different people because the people that you speak to they don't understand you in the same manner and at times what I can tell you is that as I am here before this Amnesty, I am explaining everything word by word, because there is a tendency of not trusting the people who come to take statements from you.  I may further point out that at court during the trial I did not make mention of the diary and I realise that if I mention it in court it was going to count against me because I was a member of the IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> ... but I will pass that one.  When you mentioned the diary, can you explain to us whether in your opinion the diary was indeed found in the person of Mr Jama?  You have repeatedly stated that you witnessed an extensive search on Mr Jama before he was put inside the van.   So in your opinion did the diary come from the person of Mr Jama when he was in the van?</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> I could say this diary belonged to Mr Jama because all of us who were in the van were members of the IFP, so there isn't a person who could have written in the diary that on a certain day they would go and burn so-and-so's house who was an IFP member.  I don't think it could have happened amongst IFP members.  Because at the top of the list in this diary I saw Mr Vezi's name who was at the</p>

<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> But Mr Madlala, you had witnessed an extensive search being conducted on the person of Mr Jama and there was nothing that Mr Jama was wearing except for a T-shirt, is that not so, and the diary was found in the pocket of the T-shirt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> It could happen that they are making a mistake there, but I do not know as to whether they got it from the T-shirt.  I remember he was wearing a T-shirt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> A T-shirt doesn't have pockets, does it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> Yes, I do  know that a T-shirt doesn't have pockets.</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Do you know how big a size was this diary?</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> Yes, I do remember.  It was the size of the police pocketbook.</p>

<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> It was slightly bigger than what I am having in my hand.</p>

<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a>usually sit at the back, so I saw the van stopping at that time and all those who were at the front came out and said we should conduct a search on this group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> For what were they searching?</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> I think the most important thing when you conduct a search, we always searching for arms and ammunition as well as dagga.   These are the main things that we search, but they do not specifically say that we should search them for guns.  They just said we should search them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> You understood that to mean that you must search them for guns or dagga.</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> No, whatever was unlawful that was in their possession had to be retrieved, because I went to Mr Mkhizi, that is the person I personally searched.  Even in court he pointed out that I was the one who searched him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> But if you were also searching for dagga, how come you missed an object of that size in the pockets of the deceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADLALA:</span> I don't know how to explain this because I did not search Mr Jama.  I searched Mr Mkhizi, and maybe the other ones who searched Mr Jama who could not get the diary and they only got it in the van.  Maybe they did not search him properly or they did not look into the diary or they thought it was just an ordinary book of no importance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> In your experience searches for dagga have yielded quantities far smaller than the size of that pocketbook, surely?</p>

<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Mr Chairman, I understand that Mr Jassat is on his way here.  I have just been given that information as you came in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Is there any other witness that you propose calling?</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">MR BANADE:</span> Mr Chairman, there are no further witnesses in this application.  It is just the three applicants.  If the Committee so pleases, we would like to conclude and possibly just make a few closing remarks and be on our way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> I can understand ... and what is expected of you is not just closing remarks.  I think what is expected of you is, I am sure, as much assistance as you can give this Committee on the interpretations you wish to place on the provisions of the Act that are relevant to your clients' case.  You may do that now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">MR BANADE:</span> Mr Chairman, I would like to make use of the opportunity granted to me and start by referring to section 21 of the relevant Act.</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a>	As you are well aware, there are mainly two important provisions and that is that this Committee, after considering the application, has to be satisfied that the relevant Act - and here we are referring to the murder of Jama - had to have been done with a political motive.  And interestingly enough, there are also references made to the conflict of the past.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a>	The second aspect is the applications of all the relevant facts being put before the Committee, full disclosure that is, and the further requirements are these contained in section 22 and in submission all three applicants resort to ...

<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a>MR BANADE	113	ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a>... As far as full facts go ... that is probably the aspect that bothers the Committee, otherwise I do not understand the detail which has been gone into. </p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a>	In submission, the facts in question were brought before Judge Thirion in court beyond a reasonable doubt, and that is why all three of them were convicted of murder.  So there can be absolutely no doubt that they are murderers.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a>	The finer details as to why they stopped, why the person was searched, who saw what, with all due respect had to and in anyone's memory would have somewhat become vague by now.  The applicants have absolutely no reason to come here and lie before this Committee and I think that can be accepted.  What they said before, and specifically before the Court, should be differentiated from what they have said today, if there are some differences, because the aim in a criminal trial is adversary.  Facts are withheld and others are emphasised.  But, it is the State's duty to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt, whereas here the facts are being brought to the fore as far as they can remember and to disclose, as far as they can remember, fully to the Committee.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a>	In submission, Sir, if there are differences in their versions, it is with regard to smaller aspects.  The fact is, and that has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and they acknowledge, that a certain ANC supporter had been murdered by them.  So as far as the Act refers to - I would say that it should be read in connection with the full disclosure.  The Act refers to "full" disclosure, and it should once again be read in the light of the fact that this incident took place six years ago, and everyone's memory is not as good.  And this is one aspect I would like to touch</p>

Under those circumstances,  that is neither here nor there.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a>	Harrington is the one who was consulted with more verbally and in his submission Mr Erasmus borrowed some of his terminology.  I do not think that it should affect their credibility before you in any way.  </p>

<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">MR BANADE:</span> That is what Mr Erasmus said in his brief reply to you.  He said yes, we did prepare it together in consultation with the advocate and that was the part where he was wrong, because the advocate was not present when they wrote them down, but he was not given the opportunity to elaborate on that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> He was given the opportunity to answer the questions fully.  Nobody tried to shut him up.  He also, referring to earlier documents that had nothing to do with you, said there had been no consultation when there clearly had.  There was only one document he agreed they had consulted about.  And he was not being truthful, was he.  If you read the document it is quite clear.   There was a great deal of consultation.</p>

<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">MR BANADE:</span> I don't think there can be any doubt that there was a great deal of consultation.  Before, if I understand correctly, in November of last year they gave evidence about a certain Seven Day War, and apparently for that aim they also prepared the submissions together and some of the sentences, which also appear as such now, come from that submission.  The way I see it, it cannot affect their credibility.</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Mr Banade, what do you understand when you speak about full disclosure or facts in question?  I only have the English text in front of me.  "The applicant has made a full disclosure of all relevant facts".  What do you understand to be "relevant facts"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">MR BANADE:</span> Mr Chairman, it has to be the facts of what happened when this offence took place.  Relevant facts in this case are that Mr Jama was apprehended, he was seen as an ANC supporter.  How each and everyone realised that he was an ANC supporter differs from instance to instance and the person was murdered.  Hence the fact that he was an ANC member and on the one hand they were affiliated to the right-wing and the others were Inkatha supporters.  These are the main points, these are the relevant facts.  Finer detail may differ, not always to mislead the Committee, but because these acts took place six years ago and I am just asking that it be considered reasonably.</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a>	To answer your question, we are talking about relevant facts, what happened that day and what went on in their minds and what was the political motive.  And with all due respect, Mr Chairperson, I think that has been fully disclosed to this Committee. </p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> It does not help us for them to come and say</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a>2B - 11.2	well/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a>MR BANADE	116	ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a>well, we killed this man and then you regard it as a disclosure of a material aspect.  The fact that they killed that person is not of earth shattering importance, because we know they did that.  Of importance is for them to tell us how they went about doing that.  For example, an applicant would say that I took out a knife, I stabbed him three times, and he stood up to try and run away, I tripped him and then I stabbed him twice in the back and all that sort of thing.  Those are the important details that we need to know.  That is what full disclosure is all about.  It is not enough for an applicant just to say well, I killed that person.  And perhaps you may have to address us with regard to whether or not, with reference to what I have said as important, how your clients acquitted themselves around that issue. </p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">MR BANADE:</span> Mr Chairman, yes, I agree with you that the detail of how this happened has to be disclosed, but is that not what happened?  There were eight people;  this Committee is faced with three of them.  Each one is his own individual and as these events unfolded, the one sat at the back and the one sat in front and they see different pictures.  They see things differently, being different individuals and obviously they would differ in certain details because the one saw certain things which the other didn't see.  The way I see it they did quite well in saying what each one remembers.  Each one informed the Committee as to what their role was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a>	Erasmus, and I think it is the first time he has disclosed it, has said that I am the one who came up with the suggestion that we should kill him and Harrington also said that. </p>

<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a>MR BANADE	117	ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> The first applicant, Mr Harrington, repeatedly banged the deceased's head against the rock, repeatedly, there is that kind of evidence.  It came out from Madlala.  What did Mr Harrington say about that himself?  Did he tell us about that?  Did he give us those details?</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MR BANADE:</span> As far as I can remember, he did not make mention of it, about the head banging, but in essence the rest was there.  If I remember correctly, he was dragged out and he fell and he was dragged out with a belt around his neck, he tried to escape, somebody wanted to shoot him and was stopped, told not to shoot.  And thereafter they caught the man and if I remember these details were given and thereafter the man was shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> He made no mention of this.  How can you just brush it aside and say and thereafter these details were given.  Mr Harrington did not mention it once, did he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">MR BANADE:</span> To the best of my knowledge, Mr Chairman, he did not.  Does it really make such a big different that small little detail where they differ from each other?</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> ... supposed to attach any material weight to that kind of an omission?  Is it not a significant omission as it relates to how the death in respect of which amnesty has to granted was committed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">MR BANADE:</span> Mr Chairman, the fact of the matter is, at the criminal trial it was determined that death was caused by the shot from a shotgun in the man's face.</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a>	Now the law as we all know works on the basis of a common purpose and according to that Mr Harrington is also guilty, the same as Mr Erasmus, the same as Mr Madlala.   Although this Committee would know that the person who was</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a>2B - 11.2	the/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a>MR BANADE	118	ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a>the direct cause of the shot is Mr Madlala.  Mr Harrington gave enough facts before this Committee, as far as making it an associated deed, by saying that he dragged the man out of the vehicle and chased him when he tried to escape and so forth and then he placed Mr Madlala and the shot went off.  CHAIRMAN:  I think the question that is being directed at you is, can it be said that Mr Harrington has made a full disclosure when he did not breathe a word about banging the head of the deceased, Jama, on the rock?  I think that is the level at which the question is put.  Do you think that he has made a full disclosure, in the absence of any admission by him that he had done so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">MR BANADE:</span> Mr Chairman, if I remember correctly, Mr Madlala's evidence was, as far as that aspect of the detail is concerned, was given after Mr Harrington gave evidence so there was not a chance to put this version of Mr Madlala to Mr Harrington.  And if it bothers the Committee so much then I could ask him about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> I take it you have read the judgment where Thirion J says, dealing with accused No 3 and fetching the gun</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a>"However, the deceased might have been dead or fatally injured by then.  Since he joined the common purpose after the deceased might already have been killed, he cannot be found guilty of murder.  However, if the accused No 3 believed the deceased was still alive, then he would by his act become guilty of an attempted murder".</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a>So it would appear that the court a quo found that the deceased may have been dead when the shot was fired.  That is, that the banging of the head may have already killed</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a>2B - 11.2	him/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a>MR BANADE	119	ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a>him.  That was the finding of the court a quo at page 823.  So I do not understand your submission that you said the trial court found the cause of death to be the shooting.  The trial court could not find what the cause of death was.  It was either the injuries inflicted by Harrington or the shooting, as appears at page 823 of the judgment, if you would like to look at it. </p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">MR BANADE:</span> Mr Chairman, I accept what you have just read to me.  I don't know which part of the judgment that is, but the fact remains - that is a technical aspect as to whether the man was dead before the time or thereafter, but the  intention remained among the people present in the bush that day, that if this man was not dead, shoot him in the head to ensure that he is really dead.</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> You are avoiding the question again.  The intention is, if he banged his head so hard against rocks to kill him he should have told us, all he?  If the trial court found he may, as a result of Harrington's throttling and banging his head have already killed him.  But we were not told by Harrington, were we?  And that is the point my Brother has raised with you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> On page 818 of the judgment, towards the bottom round about line 25</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a>"The account given by accused 1, 2 and 3 and Van der Hogen that accused 6 pulled the deceased out of the van, causing him to fall and that he thereafter throttled him with a belt on the ground accords with the probabilities".</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a>Then on the next page:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a>"After the deceased had run away he was pursued by accused 1 and 6 and was brought down by accused</blockquote>

<blockquote class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a>No 6.  Accused No 6's account of what happened thereafter is a curious one.  According to him he stood up, the deceased was still lying on the ground and he put his foot on the deceased's shoulder".</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a>That's his version.  Now could you kindly deal with the version about the hammering of his head - I cannot find it at the moment - against the rocks, where that emerges.</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> (Microphone not activated)</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">MR BANADE:</span> I am not in a position at this stage to take it any further.  I do not see that it comes our in the judgment of Mr Justice Thirion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> I understand your argument to mean that as far as you are concerned, they have made as full a disclosure as is required by the Act, and that if this detail is not disclosed, as far as you are concerned, they have more or less complied with the provisions of the Act.  That is your submission, is that it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">MR BANADE:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman, that is what I am trying to convey.  I cannot understand how such a small difference makes a different in a 10, 15 year sentence, because they fully disclosed their part in this offence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> There is something else also troubling me.  With regard to the second applicant, his entire explanation of what happened at the scene, is contained in a paragraph on page 4 of the statement I think of the statement he entered in, and he didn't go beyond that.  That portion read - paragraph 3 of page of his handwritten statement, which you handed in yesterday"</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a>"Ons het daar ingery".</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a>Do you see that?  The statement which you handed in </p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a>2B - 11.2	yesterday/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE	121	MR BANADE</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a>yesterday by Mr Erasmus, page 4:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a>"We drove a stretch and stopped in a bush.  Deep in the IFP area.  I got out and saw Jama running away.  I drew my 9mm pistol and pointed it at him in order to shoot him.  Harrington said I should not for fear of ballistic tests.  Harrington and Madlala traced him.  The rest of us followed.  Madlala took the shotgun from Dhlamini.  The rest of us started walking back to the vehicle and the shot went off".</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a>Has he said anything about the actual killing?  How the deceased was treated at the scene?  Has he really said anything about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">MR BANADE:</span> Mr Chairman, if one were to examine this paragraph, you would clearly see what Mr Erasmus's perspective was at the time.   He said the shot went off.  His perspective, even though the death was caused in another way, his perception was that the shot caused his death and it is quite clear that he conveyed his perception to this Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> ... the deceased was throttled by Mr Harrington many times.  At some stage he was taken out of the van with the belt around his neck and in his statement Harrington said in so many words that he ha throttled the deceased at least on more than one occasion.  Mr Erasmus is surprisingly quiet on the aspect of the throttling of the deceased.  He never said a word about it.  And yesterday he was asked a question, did you see Mr Harrington throttle the deceased with the belt.  His first reaction was:  at which stage?  And then I intervened and I said at any stage?  And then he said no, I never saw him do that.  And I asked him</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a>2B - 11.2	why/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE	122	MR BANADE</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a>why, if he never saw it at all, what was the need for him to ask at what stage.  And now it transpired from the evidence that we had today from Mr Madlala that the throttling of the deceased was done - at least at some stage in such a way that it was so many times, surely Mr Erasmus ought to have seen that.  Are you going to argue that it is possible Mr Erasmus never saw any the throttling at all, and if he did see it, why did he not tell us?  Why did he say he never saw it and why did he not tell us about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a><span class="speaker">MR BANADE:</span> Mr Chairman, perhaps I could counter that with a counter question.  That is Mr Erasmus's evidence.  If you can remember correctly he gave evidence after Mr Harrington gave evidence.  Mr Harrington himself had already told the Committee that he had strangled the deceased with his own belt.  And that has already been brought before this Committee.  What would Mr Erasmus's reason be for withholding such information and to suppress it, to use your own word.  He can't possibly have motive.  Besides, it wasn't his own actions which he was being questioned about.  	Just for interest's sake I consider that part of your question, I followed your line of questioning yesterday, and I followed it on the Afrikaans channel.  And the interpreter used the word, instead of "belt", used the word "band", and I thought that perhaps it confused Mr Erasmus somewhat - band - until he realised that the actual word being used was "belt".</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Was it about the question he was - the question was whether he was being strangled by Mr Harrington.  It makes no difference what the actual thing was that was being used.</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a><span class="speaker">MR BANADE:</span> The only point that I am trying to put to you is 2B - 11.2	that/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a>JUDGE NGOEPE	123	MR BANADE</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a>that there were a few seconds there where Mr Erasmus was a bit confused and did not know with which part you were dealing.  That is quite honestly the idea which I got.</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a>But my answer to you is, why would Mr Erasmus suppress it?  He would not achieve anything by withholding any information from this Committee.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">MR BANADE:</span> Now to go to the political motive.  This part in section 20(1)(b).  In submission I think that should be the aspect where the Committee should have the least problem.  The whole context within which this murder took place indicates that it was within and in connection with a political motive.  Eight persons from the riot squad were in a certain vehicle, three of them white, five of them were IFP affiliates, not just IFP affiliates, but	confirmed IFP supporters, and the evidence here is overwhelming that and ANC supporter could not be a constable at the time.  They picked the man up and eventually his corpse was found in the bushes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a>	The point I am trying to make is before one even goes into all the detail you find this.  What might bother the Committee is were there no other objectives, and that is how I could understand the questions.  But i submission the Act says that it had to be in association with a political motive.  It does not say that it should only be a political motive or that the context in which it should have taken place should have been 99% a political motive.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a>	The Act leaves a loophole that there could be other objectives as well with the individual.  The little loopgate which we can look at is that there could be an association or a political objective.  And in the light of all probability I think it is quite clear to this Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a>2B - 11.2	The/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a>124	MR BANADE</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a>The people did not just say it in their submissions, but I think the entire context indicates such.  The murder was associated with a political objective.  I think if I could speak on behalf of Mr Madlala, I think it was much clearer in his case.  He was not a full policeman, he was a special constable, and from a very young age he was raised with being an Inkatha supporter.  Of course at that stage they still obtained information.  He heard about this man and his involvement in murdering IFP supporters.  So in my view he qualifies for amnesty in this regard.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a>	The same with Mr Erasmus and Harrington;  their evidence to you was that at that stage they were not card-carrying members of the AWB or any other right-wing political party, but they had right-wing attitudes.  But these are young men and found themselves in a riot squad and they were indoctrinated along that line of thought and worked under violent circumstances.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a>	It all indicates that they would have had this kind of attitude towards these people.  Here they apprehend a man, find a pocketbook in his possession.  Once again, after I read Judge Thirion's judgment last night, on page 814, where he refers to the pocketbook.  The pocketbook surfaced in that trial already.  They found a pocketbook.  Some of them understand Zulu.  Those who understand Zulu tell the others in the vehicle that this person has mentioned something about killing policemen and that he is anti-IFP and we also know that it took place approximately 14 days after the KwaShange bus incident.  With all due respect, I think this is ... (CHANGE OVER TO TAPE 3A) ... and at the very least  one of the objectives of this group was politically motivated. </p>

<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a>125	MR BANADE</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a>	In submission I think that it was probably 80% politically motivated.    But it is something which the Committee has to consider in the light of the facts. </p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> ... act committed with a political objective, not politically motivated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">MR BANADE:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman.  The words in the English version speak about a political objective.  The Afrikaans one speaks about a political point of view.  A point of view has got a broad context.   Objective and point of view, I don't think it limits the fact that the act was committed 100% with a political view.</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a>	The way I see it the Act made provision for that.  Because if one looks at the people who drew up the Act and you look at the act which was committed, your feeling tells you that this is the type of act for which the Amnesty Act was drawn up. </p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a>	Mr Chairman, that is then my submission to this Committee.  As it pleases the Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> With regard to the pocket diary, are you arguing that - I know that the trial Judge referred to the pocket diary - but on the evidence we have now, are you arguing that one can really make a finding that there was such a pocket diary, taking into account two points.  Firstly, the fact that this person was thorough searched and that they were in fact even looking for dagga.  And secondly, this bizarre behaviour on the part of the police simply throwing away such a document which would have been important to them.  (Inaudible) diary could have emerged from.</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a><span class="speaker">MR BANADE:</span> Mr Chairman, as I understood the evidence, the pocketbook did not come from a pocket.  I think within the</p>

<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a>126	MR BANADE</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a>context, they were driving, they saw a person, or saw a group, they stopped, got out of the vehicle and now these people are being searched in the way Mr Madlala said.  And I think on a balance of probabilities it could have happened.  All 15 of them weren't thoroughly searched, but there was some sort of search conducted on Mr Jama.  The first problem which they would encounter is whether there was something hard on this person in the form of a weapon.  I do not think it was a thorough search and I do think it was possible that something as soft as a book could have been discovered at a later stage.  And the person who had initially searched him could have felt the book and probably not paid much attention to it since they weren't really looking for books, but rather weapons and so forth and that a weapon did not surface.  And at a later stage when they had this person in the back of the police van they could have felt that there was something else here and under more calm circumstances they could have found the book.  They saw that the man was trying to hide something and secondly they weren't merely searching for weapons but also for dagga. </p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a>Which could still have been hidden in that little pocketbook.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a>	Mr Chairman, I still do not think, notwithstanding the fact that there are probably a few questions about that, I do not think that the Committee can find that there was no pocketbook.  That was the version which surfaced in front of Judge Thirion.  And I think even in that trial there were differences.  But even his words on page 814 of the original judgment, with regards to why Harrington, accused No 6, went to go and sit at the back.  "The most likely reason why accused 6 would have wanted to question the deceased would</p>

<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a>	I read through it once again last night and Judge Thirion does not refer to it again, but it seems as though he was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that there was a pocketbook found in his possession. </p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Mr Banade, the pocketbook is highly auspicious.  But is there any evidence on which it can be found that there was no pocketbook?</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a><span class="speaker">MR BANADE:</span> Mr Chairman, with all due respect, no.  I can't think of any evidence against that which was heard here.  To tell the truth, Erasmus says that he found the pocketbook - I beg your pardon - Harrington says that he found the pocketbook, Erasmus says that he was sitting in the front of the vehicle, he heard about the pocketbook.  He did not physically see the pocketbook.  Mr Madlala also confirms that there was a pocketbook found.</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Be careful in your answer, because there is evidence that he was searched and nothing was found on him.  There is that evidence.   Isn't there?  Is there evidence that he was found and nothing was found on him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> And bearing in mind that Madlala did not tell the trial court anything at all about the pocketbook.  But be that as it may.  The point that concerns is, why was that pocketbook thrown away?  Can you tell us what the reason was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a><span class="speaker">MR BANADE:</span> Mr Chairman, just to answer the first part.  In my opinion there is overwhelming evidence that there was a pocketbook, albeit purely based on Judge Thirion's judgment and there ware three persons who make mention of it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a>The fact that he was searched and nothing was found on </p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a>3A - 11.2	him/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a>128	MR BANADE</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a>him, I do not think on the basis of that bit of evidence one can say that there was no evidence.  It is possible that nothing was found at that stage.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a>	But to go to your question as to why it was thrown away.  Certainly it is strange, but one has to bear in mind that these persons are affiliated to a riot squad, working in a riot squad, they are not investigators, they are not your typical charge office policemen, they are riot squad policemen.  They are in a completely different category.  They are used to have a physical presence at certain places and they do not take matters to court.  So for a typical young man under those circumstances who found the pocketbook, and at that time his thoughts were to assault this man, decided to throw the pocketbook away.  Why he did it may seem irrational today, but I do not think it should be regarded as so irrational that one could assume on the basis of that bit of evidence that there was no pocketbook.</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> ... allegedly contained not only the name of a prominent IFP person, but a number of houses which were targeted.  If they throw it away how would they be able to go and warn those people who are potential victims, who were listed in the pocket diary and say we found your addresses listed in the pocketbook of a possible hit man, he might have conspired  with other people, be careful.  How would they go and warn them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a><span class="speaker">MR BANADE:</span> Mr Chairman, I myself am not aware of addresses being in there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> The addresses.  That is what Mr Madlala said.  In fact, at some stage he referred to it as a hit list.</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a><span class="speaker">MR BANADE:</span> I cannot answer you there.  You have already cross-examined that evidence and I cannot answer that</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a>3A - 11.2	question/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a>129	MR BANADE</p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a>question. </p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> There is overwhelming evidence that a pocketbook was found, and probably no one can say anything against that.  There is, however, a serious dispute on how this pocketbook was found.  According to the evidence of Harrington he states that it was himself and Mr Madlala who found the pocketbook in a pocket T-shirt which was worn by Mr Jama who is deceased.  So there is a dispute on how this pocketbook was found and who found it.  What is your response to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a><span class="speaker">MR BANADE:</span> Mr Chairman, my response to that would be, as I said earlier today, there is a six year gap between the happenings on that day and today.  If one should be questioned today about details of an incident that took place six years ago, they would be a bit  vague, and obviously different people see things differently.  The Judges in the Supreme Court and magistrates are aware of that and I would have to attribute the differences to these two factors, the gap between when the incident took place and now and also the different individuals' way of seeing things.</p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> You may proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> As a matter of interest, in his statement which was submitted to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, he refers to the pocketbook having been</p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a>"a pocketbook was found in his shirt pocket".  You said earlier you weren't if there was any reference to it.  He in fact did say so. </p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> He says the same thing in his statement which is before us on page 6, that is the third paragraph.</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Anyway, it is quite clear that you cannot take</p>

<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a>130	MR BANADE</p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a>the matter very much further than that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a><span class="speaker">MR BANADE:</span> Indeed, Mr Chairperson.  These are the submissions I would like to make and I would just like to add lastly that the two important loopholes about relevant facts and full disclosure in conjunction with a political objective, I think Mr Chairman, have been shown to this Committee and I do not think the Committee should have any problems in finding that all three the applicants meet the requirements for amnesty and should be granted amnesty in terms of the Act.</p>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> I take it you agree he does not fall within the provisions of section 20(2)(b), or that they don't fall within.  That is</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a>"Any employee of the State or any former State, or any member of the Security Forces, in the course and scope of his or her duties and within the scope of his or her express or implied authority, directed against a publicly known political organisation engaged in a political struggle against the State"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a>This was not bona fide within the course and scope of his duties.  You agree?</p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a><span class="speaker">MR BANADE:</span> Mr Chairman, yes.  I have to say that in preparation for this Committee meeting I did look at paragraph 20(2)(b).  I read it over and over again and asked myself this question as to whether people were to work within their narrow scope you know, to get amnesty, or whether somebody went beyond their call of duty, should it really  make such a big difference.  I think strictly speaking, apparently they were - when they decided to kill this person it was on a frolic of their own.</p>

<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a>ADV DE JAGER	131	MR BANADE</p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Mr Banade, if they act within the police line of duty does it say that they could not have committed a murder, if they were within the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act?   The Police Act does not authorise any policeman to commit a murder.</p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a><span class="speaker">MR BANADE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> It may authorise a police officer to shoot a person during an arrest, but not to murder a person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a><span class="speaker">MR BANADE:</span> Exactly, I agree with you.  It cannot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> ... as far as you are concerned, these three people were on a frolic of their own.  Is that how you put it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a><span class="speaker">MR BANADE:</span> According to a strict interpretation of section 20(2)(b) where they speak about, and as Judge Wilson read it, in the course and within the ambit.  It is not just within the course.  It says "and within the scope of his or her duties and within the scope of his or her authority" to have committed it.  That puts them in a very tight corridor.  That is what I was trying to say to Judge Wilson.  I cannot imagine what the person drawing up the Act meant.   But they still qualify in terms of paragraph (a), where it says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a>"Any member or supporter of a well-known political organisation".</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> If Mr Madlala gives evidence that he was trained to do it and that it was the objective of trained constables?</p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a><span class="speaker">MR BANADE:</span> Mr Chairman, then the person that drew up the Act did not provide for that.  Because I think the intention of the Act was to make provision for such acts in applications for amnesty as well, but it hasn't been done.</p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> It is quite clear that you are not (inaudible).</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a>3A - 11.2	MR BANADE:  /...</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a>132	MR BANADE</p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a><span class="speaker">MR BANADE:</span> They are going to have to qualify what section 20(2) says as far as "any supporter of any political organisation" is concerned.  There is no evidence before this Committee that it was the instruction of the Conservative Party or the AWB or the Democratic Party, but that they were rightwingers, and under those circumstances, Mr Chairman, within the context of that time, there was a very broad spectrum of political affiliations which were anti-ANC, and in that regard certainly they were supporters of that broad political spectrum.</p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Before commencing, I may just say, Mr Chairman, I am informed that the attorney for Mrs Jama is now present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a>	Mr Chairman, the problem I have with these applications is that accepting that there was what one has heard in previous enquiries, a "sub culture" in the police, a sub culture of violence and very strong anti-ANC beliefs and so on, accepting that, the problem with these applicants is, I think, to a large extent the fact that in February 1990 the African National Congress, amongst other formerly illegal organisations, was unbanned.  And, indeed, on the day in question the applicants had been to some sort of gathering where there were approximately 2000 members of the ANC which they were monitoring and/or protecting or guarding.  And you will recollect further that one of the members of the ANC at that particular gathering requested Constable Harrington to ask him special constables to refrain from toyi-toying in case it led to I imagine difficulties.  And notwithstanding his avowed contempts and hatred for the ANC, he complied willingly in a spirit of great cooperation.  I find that strange. </p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a>	Then later on these 10 or 15 young men are accosted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a>3A - 11.2	I/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a>MR BRINK	133	ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a>I believe that they would all have been searched, because the purpose of the police was to check on whether they had things, as came out in the evidence, firearms, dagga and the like.  And then this notebook or diary or whatever it is, is discovered. </p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a>	It doesn't matter from whom it came.  The point is that on the evidence, and if you accept the evidence, there was this document which was extremely important to the applicants, more particularly to Mr Harrington and Mr Erasmus, because had they kept that document, and after the death of Mr Jama, they could have taken that document to their superiors and said this is what we've done and although maybe we shouldn't have done it, we did it because we discovered this vital information.  That would have helped them.  But to throw this document away, this pocketbook or whatever it is away, seems to me to be something which certainly can't advance their case.  Had they kept it and had they not killed Jama, but they did kill him so it doesn't matter, but the point is they would obviously have done better by taking him to the police station and arresting him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a>	And then it is very odd, when you consider that at the bottle store, without discussing the matter between themselves - and I now refer to the first and second applicants - they have exactly or almost exactly the same thought.  They both have this so-called inner explosion, they both suddenly are reminded of the murder of Major Terblanche, they both refer to a member of the ANC, an avowed communist sitting amongst them, they both refer to atrocities of the past, and this is very extraordinary to say the least, they then have this feeling without having </p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a>3A - 11.2	discussed/....</p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a>MR BRINK	134	ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a>discussed it. </p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a>	I think the problems the applicants face are those and I myself am not persuaded that a political objective has been shown.  There may well have been some sort of political motive, but I am not that that covers what is required in terms of the Act.  And unless there are any questions, those are my submissions. </p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> If there was a pocket book, on the assumption that there was, could it not have been thrown away as part of an exercise to destroy evidence of their criminal behaviour for fear it might be detected?</p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Yes, there is that possibility.  More especially if we accept the evidence that one of the applicants called upon the other not to fire because of the danger of ballistics testing at a later stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> But what did they kill him for?  Except that he was really a member of the ANC which was at loggerheads with the IFP at the time and bearing in mind that during that time there was a lot of political conflict in that area, I doubt whether had he not been a member of the ANC they would have killed him.  Doesn't that go a long way towards showing political motive? Political motive or, in the wording of the Act, towards showing that their act was associated with a political objective, to harass, to weaken, to kill members of the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Yes, certainly to harass, and one accepts and I think Adv De Jager put a question at an earlier stage, notwithstanding the fact the ANC was unbanned, there was continual trouble which exists to this day between the ANC and the IFP, yes, that is so.  But of course it may well be that the applicants subjectively believed that the late Mr</p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a>3A - 11.2	Jama/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a>MR BRINK	135	ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a>Jama was a member of the ANC.  I am not sure if the evidence disclosed he was wearing an ANC T-shirt, but he was certainly associated with the group, some of whom were wearing an ANC T-shirt. </p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a>	But it seems, if you consider the statements handed in yesterday in their handwriting, what caused them to commit this murder?  In their own words they have this identical belief or identical motive the murder of Major Terblanche, the fact they have an ANC member and an alleged communist in their presence;  they both think that.  Personally speaking, my submission is that that doesn't amount in itself to a political objective. </p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> You must remember that the whole idea of killing ANC members had been there even before that day.  It is not something which simply originated on that day.  It had always been in their mind, and probably they had killed others, I don't know.   The fact is that there had been that kind of mentality that you can kill an ANC member.  So it doesn't really surprise one, does it, that on that day both of them had the idea of killing the man.</p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Mr Chairman, yes, I concede that and I agree with that entirely.  The point is that one has now learnt there was a degree of Third Force activities and that these two applicants were part of that Third Force.  Of that I think there can be little doubt, notwithstanding the fact the ANC was unbanned.  You've heard evidence and research has shown Third Force did exist, even after the unbanning of the ANC, more particulary so, yes, I accept that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Mr Brink, if there was a Third Force, officially a Third Force, weren't they acting in the scope of the Third Force business?</p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a>3A - 11.2	MR BRINK:  /...</p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a>MR BRINK	136	ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> That depends on whether the Third Force falls within the definition of a political organisation.  That sort of thing, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Or Security Forces.</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Or Security Forces.</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> But they were officially paid by the government, the Third Force.</p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Yes.  But of course you've heard there have been denials that a Third Force ever existed from the part of the previous government.</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> The other point that you made was that they had a strong case, or they could have had a strong case against the deceased with the diary and the like.  But my guess is that in many so-called political killings, even in the undisputed ones, the person had the choice to do something else.  It is just that they go for the worst thing which is murder.  But if you start looking at it, it doesn't mean that anyone of them didn't have any alternative.  For one thing they could have left the deceased.  Everybody had that choice.  I don't know whether one can use that rigorous test against their actions and say well, they shouldn't have killed him, they should have taken him to the police station.  After all they had the diary, that sort of thing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a>All these murders are foolish, anyway, aren't they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Of course had they not killed the deceased they wouldn't be applying for amnesty today so one knows that happened.  And the question then arises:  under which of the subsections of section 20 may apply.  With respect, I think it is common cause that section 20(2)(b) does not apply.  If you have a look at section 20(2)(f) any person who on reasonable grounds believed that he was acting in the course</p>

<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a>and scope of his authorities or implied authority, if they had the subjective belief that their conduct might well have been approved by their superiors, my problem with that is all very well had the diary been kept, but the diary was thrown away and they concealed all the evidence and never reported the matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> (Inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Under (a)?  The question arises whether there has been the full - sorry 2(a), I beg your pardon, yes.   The political organisation of course is the AWB which they then supported, or the policies of which they then supported.  They certainly weren't supporters of a liberation movement, unless one can say in a strange way the AWB was a liberation movement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Could they have been supporters of Inkatha?</p>
<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Yes, indeed, I accept that.  I accept they would have tacitly supported Inkatha, even if they weren't members yes, certainly, yes, I accept that.  I don't dispute that.  I don't challenge that at all.   (CHANGE OVER TO TAPE 3B)</p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> ... the applicants are lying with regard to the discovery of the diary, of what significance would be that lie?  It may be that they introduced that aspect as an attempt to bolster their case, to try and show that the murder was politically motivated because here is somebody with a diary in which he mentions having killed IFP people and the like.  You know they might have unwisely introduced that element with the false hope that it would bolster their case.  But if one finds that they were lying, what damage, if any, can it do to their case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Mr Chairman, I think one can't really make a finding that there was no diary.  That aspect of the</p>

<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a>evidence given is suspicious.  We know the search took place.  Everyone has confirmed the existence of a diary and it seems to have been accepted by the trial court that there was a diary or pocketbook.</p>

That's why I am asking you to consider the question at the hypothetical level at which I am putting it to you.

<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Mr Brink, I'd like to say that the result was that the court was not able to resolve all the points of dispute satisfactorily, but the appeal was considered on the basis of the following findings.   So all disputes were not resolved satisfactorily.</p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> No, Mr Chairperson, the Judge had a very difficult time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Mrs Jama, is your attorney here?   Mr Jassat, do you still represent Mrs Jama?</p>

<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> You have been asked to make a statement on behalf of Mrs Jama.</p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a><span class="speaker">MR JASSAT:</span> Mr Chairman, my client has heard the applicants' request that she forgive them.  But she is not able to do so because she doesn't believe a word of what they have said in their application.  She doesn't believe that they have been frank with this Committee, and effectively the question of their political motives is basically an excuse to get out of gaol.</p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a>	She has also  instructed me to advise this Committee that this question of the pocket diary is something that the applicants manufactured because they had to have an excuse</p>

<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a>MR JASSAT	140	ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a>for having detained her son.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a>	Her belief is that the only reason why her son was arrested was simply because he put his hand in his pocket and the fact that the had an ANC shirt.  If the applicants were bent on their political objectives, then we fail to understand why the 10 people that were in the group who were members of the ANC, were  not all taken into custody and done away with.  Why Jama was selected.  And it seems that the deceased got killed simply because he put his hand in his pocket. </p>
<p class="line" id="line566"><a name="pos566"></a>	Her belief is, and she is merely speculating, because this inquiry is merely about who is speaking the truth, she believes that her son was so badly assaulted by the police that they couldn't let him live in case he went to the authorities.  Having been found out they now use politics as an excuse for having done him in. </p>
<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a>	She is quite prepared to forgive them if they come clean and speak the truth, but she has faith in your Committee in deciding whether they should be granted amnesty or not.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line568"><a name="pos568"></a>	Her one difficulty is the following.  That it appears from the evidence that the deceased was killed because he said something about the KwaShange incident.  She knows as a fact that her son was with her in Richmond at the time of the KwaShange incident and he could not have known about it or taken part in it.  So therefore the explanation tendered by the applicants for killing him, she cannot accept that.  	The other aspect that worries us is the fact that these applicants - some of them testified that Major Terblanche had given them an undertaking that if they got themselves into trouble he will be there to protect them.  But at the</p>

<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a>time when the deceased was murdered, Major Terblanche was no more around, he was already dead.  So who was going to protect them?  I don't know what the role is of the commanding officers who were in charge of their unit after Major Terblanche was murdered, because I wasn't here, but it seems that their story that they did this with a political motive must be rejected.  They are basically rogue policemen who just got out of line and committed a crime and are now using the provisions of the amnesty in order to get out of prison. </p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a>	Thank you, Mr Chairman. </p>
<p class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Mr Jassat, yesterday when we adjourned, it was understood that you would be afforded an opportunity at half past nine this morning to be here.  We haven't had a word from you as to why you have shown this Committee the courtesy of an explanation as to why you were not here or to apologise for your non-attendance this morning.  It was arranged that you were going to be allowed to question witnesses at half past nine this morning and members of my Committee would like to know why.</p>
<p class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a><span class="speaker">MR JASSAT:</span> I am sorry that I haven't apologised.  As you know, I came into this matter at the last minute, as I indicated to you yesterday.  I had other commitments, we had to be in court this morning, and I was trying to get out of a case this morning, but unfortunately it proceeded and finished at eleven o'clock.  Immediately that finished I had no way of contacting the Committee because I did not have a telephone number and immediately I got a call I arrived at this hearing.  To that end I don't want to be disrespectful to this Committee, but I must apologise again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> You say that you came here as a response to</p>

<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a><span class="speaker">MR JASSAT:</span> Yes, I was on my way here and I got a call as well from a lady by the name of Tando.   I believe that was at the request of Mr Brink.</p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> I was just wondering what would have happened if we had not made a call.</p>
<p class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a><span class="speaker">MR JASSAT:</span> I was on my way.   The other difficulty of course I've had is that in preparing for this hearing I had no documentation, I have come completely blind into this hearing and I've come here merely to assist Mrs Jama.</p>
<p class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> I don't think that is the problem;  that's not the problem.  The problem is that it was arranged at half past nine this morning that you would be here.  Yesterday we knew that you had no documents, you made that point yesterday.   We are talking about the fact that you did not attend this morning, nor was there any explanation offered for your not being here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a><span class="speaker">MR JASSAT:</span> I have tendered an explanation, Mr Chairman.  I was asked to address this Committee in response to the application.  Had I been asked at the initial outset as to why I was not here, I would have explained that.   Now that you've raised it, I have explained it, and I hope you will accept the explanation.  Unfortunately I had other commitments in court.  It wasn't appointments, it was a court matter which should have been adjourned but ....(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> But why didn't you tell us yesterday about it, you knew about your court appointment.  Why did you agree to be here at half past nine this morning?</p>

<p class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a><span class="speaker">MR JASSAT:</span> I said I was going to take instructions from my client, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Why do that when you knew you had an appointment in court?</p>
<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a><span class="speaker">MR JASSAT:</span> Mr Chairman, I didn't have my diary with me.  I had come in as a last minute legal representative for Mrs Jama.  I've come here to assist Mrs Jama and to that end I hope I have achieved that.   But I've had appointments made in respect of court matters, those are fixed long before this hearing.  Had adequate notice been given to Mrs Jama and had she consulted me there wasn't a question of probably double-dating so to speak.</p>
<p class="line" id="line593"><a name="pos593"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Are you able to ascertain from Mrs Jama what the age of the late Mr Jama was at the time of his death?</p>
<p class="line" id="line594"><a name="pos594"></a><span class="speaker">MR JASSAT:</span> I was told that he was born in 1972.</p>
<p class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Was he still at school at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line596"><a name="pos596"></a><span class="speaker">MR JASSAT:</span> Yes, he was going to go to school.  The reason why he left Richmond was because of the problems that were taking place in Richmond and he had to flee, and that is the reason why he came to stay in the area near Edendale.</p>
<p class="line" id="line597"><a name="pos597"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> It is a convenient stage to take the adjournment.  We will now adjourn and resume at two o'clock.</p>

I would just like to hear from you if you have finished with these three applicants and if we can leave for Bloemfontein at this stage.

<p class="line" id="line608"><a name="pos608"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Mr Chairman, I have had an opportunity to consult with the victims, they are here.  It is the wife of the deceased and the brother of the deceased.  Basically what they said to me is, as long as the applicant makes full disclosure of the truth, they don't see why they should oppose the application for amnesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line609"><a name="pos609"></a>	But I outlined to them the function of the Amnesty Committee as a whole and the fact that it might appear from the applicant's evidence that the whole incident was political.  They then said to me they are not aware of such a fact and their only concern with the application for amnesty on behalf of the applicant, and if he is granted amnesty, is their safety.   They are concerned about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line610"><a name="pos610"></a>	I then outlined to them their rights to say something if they want to.  They said they will think about it and they are more interested in hearing what the applicant has to say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line611"><a name="pos611"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> ... it is therefore not possible at this stage to say whether this application can be disposed of this afternoon, or can we say that?</p>

<p class="line" id="line624"><a name="pos624"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR WILLS:</span> Mr Mzimela, can you tell the honourable Committee as to why you are applying for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line625"><a name="pos625"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> I have come to apply for amnesty with regard to Mr Mkhononodaka Gumede's death and I was directly involved in his death.</p>
<p class="line" id="line626"><a name="pos626"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Will you tell the Court the circumstances surrounding Mr Gumede's death.</p>
<p class="line" id="line627"><a name="pos627"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> From 1990 when the political organisations were being unbanned, the IFP as a political organisation that existed at the time, we stay in the rural areas at the Chief's place and we believed that other political organisations were not supposed to exist and some people got involved with different political organisations and there was a conflict among these political organisations especially with regard to IFP and ANC.  And Mr Gumede was the Chief's councillor.   He was one of the prominent members of Inkatha in that area.  And as from 1990 there were certain occurrences that took place because on one particular day there was a meeting at the Chief's place Nchinga, and Montunkosi Gumede, who was a soldier, died.  Montunkosi was an ANC member.  Because on that particular day that he died they said that he apparently said he was an MK soldier and they were nothing, that's why they killed him.  And we have a belief that the followers were doing</p>

<p class="line" id="line630"><a name="pos630"></a>this because they had taken orders from their leaders.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line631"><a name="pos631"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> This individual you said was killed, where was he killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line632"><a name="pos632"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> He was killed at Mjeti, at the Chief's place, where there was an Inkatha meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line633"><a name="pos633"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Who did the community believe killed this individual?</p>
<p class="line" id="line634"><a name="pos634"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> The community believed that there were certain people from Eskhwani(?) who were shown by the local residents that this was the man.  Whether he did utter those words or not I am not clear, but he was apparently against the IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line635"><a name="pos635"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Mr Mzimela, I would like you to listen very carefully to the questions I am asking you.  Was there a belief that a certain political party was behind the killing of this individual, and if so, which political party?</p>
<p class="line" id="line636"><a name="pos636"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> It is something that happened.  It was the IFP which had convened a meeting at the Chief's place on that day.  It was directly involved in the killing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line637"><a name="pos637"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Can you give the honourable Committee an estimate as to the date of this occurence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line638"><a name="pos638"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> I don't think I will be able to be specific, but it was in mid-1990.  Then in December an attack took place, another member of Inkatha,  (name indistinct) Mzimela, was attacked and killed in his house together with his wife as well as his three-month old child.  At that time the Chief had put one of his sons in his position.  According to the information that we got it was discovered that he had been killed because he was a member of the ANC and he was mobilising the people in that area to be members of the ANC.  And they said that he should be killed because</p>

<p class="line" id="line641"><a name="pos641"></a>he was going to make people get aligned with the ANC.  On that day that they attacked his place they went to attack a certain family by the name of Xila, whom it was discovered that they were also ANC aligned.  His name was Xoto Xila.  Luckily they couldn't find him at his place because he had visited a certain place.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line642"><a name="pos642"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> ... any individuals who were involved in this attack on Bonge Nkosi Panana Mzimela?</p>
<p class="line" id="line643"><a name="pos643"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> Yes, when we did the follow-up as to how he was killed, we got the people who were involved and they were consequently reported to the police, but their case didn't go any further.</p>
<p class="line" id="line644"><a name="pos644"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Do you know the names of those people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line645"><a name="pos645"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> I think it is an open secret that the Chiefs had what was called the G3's who were keeping guard over them and on that particular day they were at Chief Lindilize Mzimela Tokosani Nguni.  The guns were taken from them on that day.  They were taken by an induna by the name of Gabathela Dhlamini.  And we asked as to where the guns had been taken to.  He didn't want to explain or elaborate and he was scared, so he couldn't do anything because the guns had been taken by the higher authorities and there was a certain man known by Thawo Xila(?) who was working for the KwaZulu Government and driving the cars.  We discovered that he was one of the people who was driving the cars that had gone to Bongo Nkosi Mzimela's place to attack.  Mlunzani Zungu was an Induna in Makolokolo.  It was discovered later on that he was present as well as Mkhononodaka Gumede.  They were all there and they convened a meeting before then and they used to have camps at his house before launching attacks.  It is the deceased's house.  They used to convene</p>

<p class="line" id="line647"><a name="pos647"></a>MR WILLS	149	 MR MZIMELA</p>

<p class="line" id="line649"><a name="pos649"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> What other incidents would you like to reveal to the Committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line650"><a name="pos650"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> When this took place, when Bonkosi was killed, because they said he should not be a Chief because he was aligned to the ANC, quite a number of other people were his followers and I was also one of his followers.  We were aligned to the ANC and it was clear now that the situation was no longer conducive to being an ANC member.  It was difficult for us to hide ourselves and we ended up showing the community that we were ANC aligned and we did not believe that we had to be killed simply because we were members of the ANC.  It continued.  We spoke to the police, as I have already mentioned some names, but the police never went to arrest those people, not even a single one of them was arrested.  The very same police, Togozani Mguni was arrested but he was released the following day and that was the end of it.  Then in 1991 one comrade by the name of Lucky Mhlongo, who was at Sam's place they went to attack Sam's place and shot Sam there and killed him.  The people who did that were the Indunas Gambaqana Zuma, Mandla Nkosi Jaba Mzimela, Douglas Buza Mzimela as well as other people were present, but they were the prominent leaders.  So that's why I remember their names.   The first problem that we encountered was that as ANC members we were going to be eliminated.  And we remained being aligned to the ANC and we didn't want to have any conflicts with the IFP.  We used to conduct our meetings in the forests because we did not want to be detected by the Chief because the Chief was an IFP member and we kept on mobilising the community and recruiting them in a clandestine manner and they were able</p>

<p class="line" id="line652"><a name="pos652"></a>MR WILLS	150	MR MZIMELA</p>
<p class="line" id="line653"><a name="pos653"></a>to give us information as to what the plans were as far as Inkatha was concerned.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line654"><a name="pos654"></a>	Then in 1992 the IFP was holding a march at Makolokola what they call Nqabani.  They said that's where they made resolutions that they were going to harass the ANC people.  One of them was Gerhard Vana Mzimela, who was mentioned as the leader of the ANC because in 1991 Harry Gwala and Chris Hani came to Empangeni Hall and he took some of the comrades and that's what made him to be on the wrong side of the Inkatha.  We discovered that through Alfred Nutunhlongo, who was at the meeting that was held at (indistinct) Gumede.  It happened that on the 22nd February 1992 Gerald was driving his car from Mhlangubu.  Because the road was passing at that man's place, he saw the people who were in that meeting but he continued to drive and he proceeded to Maqegana and went to another person called Philemon Ndoda Mzimela to tell him that he had seen Inkatha members conducting a meeting and he said he saw Nontu and he came to warn us that we should take our children away because the Inkatha was going to launch an attack and he left and went to Mhlangubu to another comrade called (indistinct) Zondi.  At about six that afternoon he got those people on the road where they stopped his car and they shot him, he died instantly, and they took his car out of the road and threw it out of the road.  On that very same night another group of men who were armed went to the house of a certain man who was known as a person who mobilised the community.  He also owned a tuck shop and there was a belief that all those people who went into his house to buy were also directly involved in mobilising the community.  And whilst he was inside the tuckshop selling he saw a man who was standing at the </p>

<p class="line" id="line657"><a name="pos657"></a>doorway and started shooting indiscriminately.  He got under the counter to try and hide himself.  Then he got a chance to escape, but he was not injured in any way.  Unfortunately three people who were there died and some were injured in the attack.  Jongula Mhlongu is one of those who died, Puma Hahlo Mzimela as well as his wife and the others got injured.  And one of the people who got injured was an IFP member.  But since he got injured he realised that the IFP had actually injured him so he changed floors and joined the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line658"><a name="pos658"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Just for clarity, Mr Mzimela.   On the 3rd of December 1990, where an individual by the name of Bongo Nkosi Panana Mzimela was killed, is it correct that this individual was in fact your brother?</p>
<p class="line" id="line659"><a name="pos659"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> Yes, that was my brother.  We were born from separate mothers but from the same father.</p>
<p class="line" id="line660"><a name="pos660"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> You also mentioned the death of Gerard Mzimela on the 22nd of the 2nd 1992.  Is it also correct that this Gerard Mzimela was your brother as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line661"><a name="pos661"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> Yes, that is correct, he was also my brother.  They were born by the same mother with Bongo Nkosi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line662"><a name="pos662"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> In respect of the death of Gerard Mzimela, what information did you receive as to the identities of the persons responsible for his death?</p>
<p class="line" id="line663"><a name="pos663"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> As I have already explained, he had seen an Inkatha meeting that was convened and he also saw Alfred Muntu Mhlongo.  He is the one who told him that he was from the meeting and that a resolution had been taken that because he had taken certain comrades to the hall to speak with Chris Hani and Harry Gwala he was busy mobilising the people to be aligned with the ANC so he should be killed.</p>

<p class="line" id="line667"><a name="pos667"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> The people who killed him were a group, but amongst them was Mr Mkhononodaka Gumede and Mike Mhlongo, Mako Hlomba Gumede who stays at Mgwelizani.  He had come to kill people in that place.</p>

<p class="line" id="line669"><a name="pos669"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> The meeting was held at Mr Gumede's place who was a councillor in that place, that is the Chief's place.</p>

(inaudible) ... heard the evidence that the deceased, this Ndudaga Gumede was named by the witness in this regard.  I am seeking to clarify the issue of where the initial meeting took place, and I think that will throw further light on this issue.   Mr Mzimela, you must listen to the questions carefully and just answer the questions.  I want to know the name of the person whose home the meeting that you referred to was held at.</p>
<p class="line" id="line672"><a name="pos672"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> It was at Mr Ndudaga Gumede, the deceased.</p>

<p class="line" id="line676"><a name="pos676"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> As I have already explained, that on the 22nd, one of my brothers, Gerard Mzimela, died.  Then it was a weekend after the 29th, we were preparing for his funeral, and Saturday morning we took the bus and went to town to</p>

<p class="line" id="line679"><a name="pos679"></a>prepare for the funeral.  It was myself, my late brother, Sibani Mzimela, Mandlagayiso Mzimela also late, Philemon Dodo Mzimela also late, and we boarded a bus.  At Mr Gumede's place, as I have already mentioned, that it was close to the road.  The bus stopped at the busstop.  We saw him at his place.  Philemon used to call him Uncle, because they were distantly related, and he said there is the Uncle and he was giving us problems.  So we saw that he was there in his house.  I had a gun with me and it was my gun.  Sibani, my younger brother, also had a gun we had borrowed from another policeman who worked for the Murder and Robbery Squad.  We decided that he was very troublesome, and we decided this was the opportunity for us to get him and we got off at the next stop, that is Sibani and myself, and the other two went to town to try and get some things to prepare for the funeral. </p>
<p class="line" id="line680"><a name="pos680"></a>	We proceeded to his house and we had 9mm guns Parabellum.  When we got into the yard we found his wife who was bending down and washing dishes and when she saw us she ran away because she saw the guns.  And I heard the toilet flushing and we proceeded to the toilet.  We found that he was taking a bath.  I stood at the door and I shot him.  The finished the first magazine and put the second one and I also shot him.  And when Sibani tried to shoot his gun locked and got jammed and I took the gun away from him and I continued to shoot him.  We picked up the empty or spent cartridges and we  ran away.  We went back to Umaqikani(?).</p>
<p class="line" id="line681"><a name="pos681"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Is it correct that you were the only person who was responsible for firing the shots which killed</p>
<p class="line" id="line682"><a name="pos682"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> That is true, because Sibani did not shoot.  When he tried to shoot his gun jammed and I took it and</p>

<p class="line" id="line686"><a name="pos686"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> The only two persons involved in the attack were yourself and Sibani, although Sibani didn't shoot at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line687"><a name="pos687"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> That is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line688"><a name="pos688"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Did you shoot anybody else at the kraal that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line689"><a name="pos689"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> Unfortunately no.</p>

<p class="line" id="line692"><a name="pos692"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Can you explain to the Committee why you actually killed this individual?</p>
<p class="line" id="line693"><a name="pos693"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> As I have related what happened in that area, we were not in good terms, the ANC and the Inkatha.  Inkatha didn't want the ANC in that area.  As I've told you that Mr Gumede was the Chief's councillor in that area.  He was together with the Booi Mzimela Kampaqele.  All these people were involved in the killings of the comrades.</p>
<p class="line" id="line694"><a name="pos694"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> I just want you to give the Committee a few details as regards your involvement with the ANC.  When did you first join the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line695"><a name="pos695"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> As I have explained, that when all the liberal organisations were unbanned, that's when we started being active.  We joined the ANC.  From 1990 to 1992 we had an organisation committee and we launched our branch officially.  There I was a general secretary on the Ongoye Branch, ANC Youth League.</p>
<p class="line" id="line696"><a name="pos696"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Did you have any meetings during 1990 as ANC members concerning the violence in your area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line697"><a name="pos697"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> Yes, we did, even though there were few because we were few, other people were dead, that's when we got united.  We used to hold these meetings in bushes or</p>

<p class="line" id="line701"><a name="pos701"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> You have testified to the effect that there was a lot of violence going on in your area and that this violence was politically related.  What steps did you decide to take at these meetings as regards this violence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line702"><a name="pos702"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> (CHANGE OVER TO TAPE 4B) ... because we realised that the police were not caring a damn about it because most of the incidents we used to know who were involved and we were telling the police and the police were ignoring those things.  Myself, I used to take care on that part because I was trained under the SNDF.</p>
<p class="line" id="line703"><a name="pos703"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Turning to your family ... former Chief in that area, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line704"><a name="pos704"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> That's correct.   My father was Lindelishele Mzimela.</p>
<p class="line" id="line705"><a name="pos705"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Is it not a tradition that the first born son of the first wife becomes Chief?</p>
<p class="line" id="line706"><a name="pos706"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> It is like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line707"><a name="pos707"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Is it also true that Bongo Nkosi Panana Mzimela was in fact the traditional heir to your father?</p>
<p class="line" id="line708"><a name="pos708"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> It was supposed to be like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line709"><a name="pos709"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Can you tell the Court why he didn't succeed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line710"><a name="pos710"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> As I have already explained, that they decided to kill Bongo Nkosi because he was aligned to the ANC and they decided that it was going to be a mistake if he takes over.  And the Chief who was there was very sick and he was in Nqgwelizani Hospital and then he told his Indunas who must take over, so he told them it must be Booi.  They knew that this was going to cause conflict because Bongo Nkosi was still alive, that's when they decided to kill him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line711"><a name="pos711"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> What is Booi's surname?</p>

<p class="line" id="line719"><a name="pos719"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And why do you think he was nominated by your father to succeed him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line720"><a name="pos720"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> I think it is because the late KwaZulu Government believed that every Chief should be Inkatha that's why then they chose Booi Mzimela my brother, because he was an Inkatha, that's when they decided that Bongo Nkosi wasn't going to be a right Chief because he was an ANC.</p>

<p class="line" id="line723"><a name="pos723"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Can I just get some clarity, Mr Wills.  Your witness has referred to a Chief who was sick at the time.  Would that be his father?  Is he making reference to his father?</p>
<p class="line" id="line724"><a name="pos724"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line725"><a name="pos725"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> Yes, that's correct, that's my father Lindelishle Mzimela.</p>
<p class="line" id="line726"><a name="pos726"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> If we could just clarify this.  Lindelishle Mzimela, when did he die?</p>
<p class="line" id="line727"><a name="pos727"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> If I am not mistaken, it was June 1993 because he was sick.</p>
<p class="line" id="line728"><a name="pos728"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> How long before his death did he nominate Booi Mzimela to be his successor?</p>
<p class="line" id="line729"><a name="pos729"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> It was a very short time, because he was sick when he said this.  He died in 1993, but he said so in 1990.  And the person who took over his duties was Booi.  In 1990</p>

<p class="line" id="line736"><a name="pos736"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINED BY MS THABETHE:</span> Mr Mzimela, I want you to clarify something for the Committee.  The deceased was Chief Chancellor at Makoloko Reserve, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line737"><a name="pos737"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line738"><a name="pos738"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Your father was Chief where, where was he Chief?  In the same area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line739"><a name="pos739"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line740"><a name="pos740"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> What was the relationship between your father and the deceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line741"><a name="pos741"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> There is an Induna and councillors in every area.  Like I said he was a chief councillor.  It is not like he was above the Chief.</p>
<p class="line" id="line742"><a name="pos742"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> ... under your father's wing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line743"><a name="pos743"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line744"><a name="pos744"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> ... evidence by you in connection with your brother's death and in connection with the IFP/ANC wars in your areas.  But what I am not clear about is why was specifically the deceased killed in relation to everything you've said?  Can you explain that to the Committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line745"><a name="pos745"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> As I have explained that he was the leader of the Inkatha people.  And they had a meeting and that's where they killed my brother who was also a soldier.  As I've explained this went on until my brother Bongo Nkosi was killed and some people who attended those meetings used to tell us most of those meetings were held in his place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line746"><a name="pos746"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> ... that Mkhononodaka was involved in the</p>

<p class="line" id="line750"><a name="pos750"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line751"><a name="pos751"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line752"><a name="pos752"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> What proof did you have of this hearsay that Mr Gumede was die person who was involved in killing your brothers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line753"><a name="pos753"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> It is obvious and it was obvious at that time.  People who used to attend those meetings.  And in these meetings that's where decisions were taken that they should kill these ANC people, as I have already mentioned some of the meetings which were held at his house or his place.   It wasn't everyone who attended those meetings who agreed with this, so they used to come back to us and tell us who said who to kill.</p>
<p class="line" id="line754"><a name="pos754"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> You refer to meetings of the IFP that were held at Chief Gumede's place, that is the late Gumede.  As far as I know the tradition is if you are a Chief the meetings of the community are usually held at the Chief's place.  Were there such meetings that were held actually, community meetings before?</p>
<p class="line" id="line755"><a name="pos755"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> I think you are asking the right person if you are asking like that, because I know most of the meetings were held at Chief's place, at my father's place, and these meetings were different.  In the old KwaZulu Government, all the Chiefs were Inkatha members.  Mr Gumede was a Chief's councillor and the councillor has the right to call a meeting and these meetings were to ... (break in recording) ... so he like to further the aims of the organisation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line756"><a name="pos756"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> You didn't report it to the police?  You didn't try and investigate it?  You decided that this was true and you proceeded with plans to revenge.</p>

<p class="line" id="line759"><a name="pos759"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> I think you are asking me, like I explained to you, all these incidents which took place at the area, no single one where the police took a stand we reported.  I even explained to you that a policeman who was guarding a Chief, one of them was taken by us to the police to explain and all the people who were implicated in the police never did a thing about it.   Police never arrested anyone.  Also in Gerald's incident, I was there, and he was killed on Saturday evening.  The next day, Sunday, we told the police,  we explained everything to the police, we gave the police e every information we had, but nothing was done.  And after the meetings people were telling us whatever decisions which were taken there and we used to tell the police all this.  And were told that there were guns which came by a Citi Golf from Ngwelizane.  One guy's name was Makothombani and he is well-known because he was a killer.  Police were told about this, nothing happened.   The following week my brother was killed.  Even though we reported before time to the police, nothing was happening.  I think even if you are lying to the police the police must prove if you are lying to them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line760"><a name="pos760"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Was the deceased killed because he gave instructions that your brothers must be killed, or because he actually was involved in the killing?  Can you make that clarification please?</p>

The bus stopped next to Mr Gumede's house and I saw Mr Gumede outside his yard and then I told my brothers that there he was, Mr Gumede.  Because it was difficult to see Mr Gumede and since he was killing comrades I told my brothers this was a convenient time for me to go visit him.

<p class="line" id="line782"><a name="pos782"></a>belonging to another policeman.  We agreed that we must go and see Mr Gumede and then we said we must go and try to kill him because people were scared of killing him.  We went there.  We passed his house and then we used the back entrance.  We took our guns out.  We went inside his house and his wife was washing dishes and then she ran away.  I heard a toilet flushing.  I went there.  When we arrived there that's when I started shooting at him.  I finished the first magazine and Sabani, my younger brother, tried to shoot him as well, and he failed and then I put another magazine.  I finished it. I took Sabani's gun.  I finished that magazine as well.  That's when we  ran away back to Maxigani, at Sabani's house.   I will be lying if I can tell you how much because one magazine had 15 and then the second one only seven rounds were left.  And then another one had 15 as well.  I think only one was left. </p>
<p class="line" id="line783"><a name="pos783"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Mr Mzimela, you went to town specifically to attend to the funeral arrangement of your late brother on that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line784"><a name="pos784"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line785"><a name="pos785"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Yet you were armed and your brother Philemon was also armed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line786"><a name="pos786"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> Yes, like I said, my gun was a licensed gun, only Sabani's gun, which belonged to another policeman, and the situation was so bad and tense that we were supposed to be armed all the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line787"><a name="pos787"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Did you travel with your firearms all the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line788"><a name="pos788"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line789"><a name="pos789"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Mr Chairman, there is one more issue that I would just like to raise, if it is possible at this stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line790"><a name="pos790"></a>4B - 11.2	CHAIRMAN:  /...</p>
<p class="line" id="line791"><a name="pos791"></a>MR WILLS	162	MR MZIMELA</p>
<p class="line" id="line792"><a name="pos792"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line793"><a name="pos793"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> These IFP meetings, how were they called and who called them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line794"><a name="pos794"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> The only person who had rights to call meetings was the Chief.  The Chief will do this by telling the Chief's counsellor.  The Chief's counsellor also had rights to call meetings.  He used to call meetings at his house.  Like I have already told you that decisions were taken at his house as to who must be eliminated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line795"><a name="pos795"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Can you tell the Committee what would happen if persons didn't go to those meetings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line796"><a name="pos796"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> People who never attended these meetings received letters from Mr Gumede.  He used to tell them that they must choose whether they want to stay in that area or to leave the area.  For example, Beki Xhosa, who was our chairperson, his house was targeted by Mr Gumede.  He used to write these letters to his house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line797"><a name="pos797"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Who was it, which person was it?  To whom was such a letter written?</p>
<p class="line" id="line798"><a name="pos798"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> Mr Gumede used to write these letters to people who never attended his meetings.  He used to tell them they must choose whether they want to stay there or to die.  And one family, Xulu's family, received that letter and they left that place and people don't know where he went.</p>
<p class="line" id="line799"><a name="pos799"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Just one final issue.  Mr Mzimela, you have killed a person.   His relatives are here.  How do you feel about this now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line800"><a name="pos800"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> Mr Gumede's death is really disturbing me.  I never had any aim or object to kill someone, but the way the IFP was killing people in our area, we had no choice.  We had to defend ourselves because they were killing us,</p>

<p class="line" id="line802"><a name="pos802"></a>MR WILLS	163	MR MZIMELA</p>

<p class="line" id="line804"><a name="pos804"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> No more questions from Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line805"><a name="pos805"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Mr Mzimela, I am not saying amnesty will be granted to you and I am not saying amnesty will not be granted to you.  But should amnesty be granted to you, are you going to go back to that area you were staying in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line806"><a name="pos806"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> I will be very much happy if this Commission can grant me amnesty.  As to going back to that area, I don't think I will.  I will go back to Eskaweni and only if the situation down there is cooled down that's when I will go back, but now I am scared.</p>
<p class="line" id="line807"><a name="pos807"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> ... on behalf of the victims, because as I mentioned earlier on, I consulted with them.  They raised a concern with me that what if you come after them.  Do you have any comments on that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line808"><a name="pos808"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> With all due respect to your Committee, Mrs Gumede is my witness, she was at her yard that day.  I didn't say a thing to her because she didn't do anything to me.  The person I was after was her husband and I don't have anything against Mrs Gumede.  It will be a mistake if today I can go back and want to kill her.  I don't have any reason why to go after Mrs Gumede and in all this incidents which happened, Mrs Gumede wasn't involved at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line809"><a name="pos809"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> What about the children of the deceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line810"><a name="pos810"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> To all the family members, I would like to tell them that I am very sorry and unfortunately I don't know his children and the only person that I can talk about in all these incidents is Mrs Gumede and I don't have a reason to go after her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line811"><a name="pos811"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> The next of kin of the victims would like to say something.</p>

<p class="line" id="line814"><a name="pos814"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line815"><a name="pos815"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> There is one thing that is not quite clear to me.  The deceased was a counsellor for your father, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line816"><a name="pos816"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line817"><a name="pos817"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> And he called meetings on behalf or instructions of your father.</p>
<p class="line" id="line818"><a name="pos818"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> There were some meetings which were called by Mr Gumede and he received those instructions from my father and there were some other meetings where he himself will just call those meetings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line819"><a name="pos819"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Were all those meetings held at your father's house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line820"><a name="pos820"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> Some of them.  If it was my father who called those meetings, those meetings were held at his place, at</p>
<p class="line" id="line821"><a name="pos821"></a>my father's place.  If it was Mr Gumede they were held at Mr Gumede's place. </p>
<p class="line" id="line822"><a name="pos822"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> And the resolutions taken to kill I presume was taken at your father's house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line823"><a name="pos823"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> Unfortunately no.  People used to tell us who went to these meetings ... (CHANGE OVER TO TAPE 5A)</p>
<p class="line" id="line824"><a name="pos824"></a>It is not easy for me to talk on behalf of my father because he never told me, but what I believe is that he couldn't have taken such decisions that his sons must be killed.  Things started changing when my father elected Booi to take over.  But I don't think he is the one who said Bongo Nkosi must be killed.  And what I am sure of is that these (indistinct) were taken.  I don't know why the police who were safeguarding my father had no guns that night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line825"><a name="pos825"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Did you ever discuss this with your father?</p>
<p class="line" id="line826"><a name="pos826"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> No, I didn't talk with my father.  My brother</p>

<p class="line" id="line829"><a name="pos829"></a>Eward was still alive and traditionally he was the one who was supposed to talk to my father in matters like that. </p>
<p class="line" id="line830"><a name="pos830"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> You didn't send your brother to talk about this with your father?</p>
<p class="line" id="line831"><a name="pos831"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> No, I didn't, but he also took that decision to go and speak with my father.</p>
<p class="line" id="line832"><a name="pos832"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Isn't it a fact that you were adversely affected by the conflict in your area.  Your family was in fact divided into two, with some family members supporting the IFP and some family members supporting the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line833"><a name="pos833"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line834"><a name="pos834"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> And isn't it a fact that the meeting which were convened by the Chief counsellor, the late Mr Gumede, wherein various decisions were taken to eliminate your brothers, were in fact convened at his own instance and at his  residence and not at your father's residence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line835"><a name="pos835"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> I think so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line836"><a name="pos836"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> ... Mr Mzimela, we want you to tell us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line837"><a name="pos837"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> Like I explained, that we used to get reports about these meetings and these reports used to come back with decisions as to who to eliminate and all those meetings were held at Mr Gumede's house, not at my father's house.  At Mr Gumede's house, that is where the decisions of eliminating my brothers were taken.</p>
<p class="line" id="line838"><a name="pos838"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> ... that Booi took over I think as Chief in 1990.</p>
<p class="line" id="line839"><a name="pos839"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line840"><a name="pos840"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> And was your father not able to perform the functions of Chief after that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line841"><a name="pos841"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> Yes, that's correct, he was sickly, very sick.</p>

<p class="line" id="line846"><a name="pos846"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> And is it also correct that ... told us about your brother Hewitt Gwenge was killed in May 1992.</p>
<p class="line" id="line847"><a name="pos847"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line848"><a name="pos848"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> And your youngest brother Sabani was stabbed in February 1994.</p>
<p class="line" id="line849"><a name="pos849"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line850"><a name="pos850"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> What did you hope to achieve by killing the deceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line851"><a name="pos851"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> The way things were happening, I thought it was going to be better if he was not alive, because he was the one who was behind all these killings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line852"><a name="pos852"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Was there any improvement of the situation after his death?</p>
<p class="line" id="line853"><a name="pos853"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> There was no improvement, it got worse.  Because it was for the first time that the IFP lost someone who was a leader.   It got worse than before because the IFP experienced this for the first time, losing someone who was a leader.</p>
<p class="line" id="line854"><a name="pos854"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> (Inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line855"><a name="pos855"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> That's when they got out and they were not hiding anything and they said because I did that everyone who was an ANC member must be killed in that area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line856"><a name="pos856"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> ... and this may be wrong, I got the impression that you were not very enthusiastic in referring or acknowledging the late Chief as your father.</p>
<p class="line" id="line857"><a name="pos857"></a><span class="speaker">MR MZIMELA:</span> That is not true.  That could be a mistake if it was conveyed as being so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line858"><a name="pos858"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> I was just wondering whether the conflict could have gone that far.  Anyway, I accept that I could be wrong.</p>

As he was not present he could say that because he did not know what happened in those meetings.  My wish was that this applicant should know that whatever he did, he did it because of the people who hated my husband.  The brothers that he is referring to, in the first place my husband was at Ngwelazani Hospital at the time that they died.  He was there admitted for three months, and the other ones, that is the two following, especially the one who died at Mzimduzu,  I was at my place together with my husband and we heard some gunshots beside the road and I was inside the house, I was cooking.  I went out and ran to my husband.  After quite some time we heard screams from the Mhlongo family of Mhlongo Place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line881"><a name="pos881"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Are there any meetings that were held in your house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line882"><a name="pos882"></a><span class="speaker">MRS GUMEDE:</span> The meetings that used to be held there according to my own knowledge, were meetings with regard to the Chief's monies or Chief's collections, meetings where people had brought their matters to be solved or problems or cases.  And the Chief would deal with those cases and they were passed on to the Induna.  That is all I know about the meetings that took place.</p>

<p class="line" id="line889"><a name="pos889"></a><span class="speaker">MRS GUMEDE:</span> Yes.  I would like to point out and clarify to the applicant that he killed my husband for no particular reason.  As he has already explained, we heard the attacks but my husband was not present.  We saw a car coming from Nqewani and this car wanted to pass through a bridge and when the other car which was coming from International came and it took a U-turn and went back to the other car which was standing at that time and that is where they started fighting.  And when there was quiet the other car went back and we were watching the attack that took place between these cars.   When the other cars came to pass through the bridge and some came to watch the incident and the police also came, I want to clarify that my husband was not present at that time.  The applicant was misled by certain people who hated my husband.</p>

Mrs Gumede, both my client and myself are very sorry for the incident that occurred and I don't want to and I don't intend to in any way show any disrespect towards you by cross-examining you on the evidence before this Commission.  I don't think it would be appropriate.  But on behalf of my client I am instructed to convey his wish that there can be real peace in the area and that this violence can stop.  Thank you.</p>

I just want to say how deeply hurt and regretful I am because you have lost your husband and a friend.  That was not my aim to just kill your husband.  It was the situation that forced me to behave in the manner that I did.  As I have already pointed out before, that I wish that you could be free because you were present when this took place.  You saw that you were not directly involved and I could not find any reason to attack you and I do not have any plans to do so in the future.  I wish to express my sincere apologies to you.  I thank this honourable Commission for having granted me the chance to address Mrs Gumede.</p>

I submit, with respect that the evidence before the honourable Commission is such that ... (CHANGE OVER TO TAPE 5b) ... The applicant has satisfied the requirements for the granting of amnesty in respect of the deed that he committed.  I submit that he has fully disclosed his involvement.  He has answered questions honestly and without 5B - 11.2	any/...</p>

<p class="line" id="line931"><a name="pos931"></a>any attempt whatsoever to evade his own responsibility for these actions.  At no stage has he attempted to blame anybody else and he has been truthful as regards the fact that this was not committed on the orders of any other person, but that it was his own decision. </p>
<p class="line" id="line932"><a name="pos932"></a>	In addition, Mr Chairperson, I am of the view that the evidence before the Committee is such that it is clear that this incident arose directly out of the political conflict that has ravaged this part of the country and it is my respectful submission that had this conflict not existed then this incident clearly would not have taken place. </p>
<p class="line" id="line933"><a name="pos933"></a>	That is the extent of my submissions, Mr Chairperson. </p>
<p class="line" id="line934"><a name="pos934"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Suppose he was misinformed about the involvement of the deceased, and that the deceased was not at all involved in the killings of his brothers, could that have any bearing on his own motivation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line935"><a name="pos935"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Motivation is, with respect, obviously something which is a personal appreciation.  If he had been misinformed, with respect, his motivation would have still been political but it would have been made on a misinformed basis.  I think, however, that there is evidence before the Commission which indicates that it is improbable that he was misinformed, and to that extent I cite the evidence of the deceased's widow who indicated that her husband was a prominent Inkatha person.  I also ask the Commission to take note of the fact that in the area at the time, particularly in rural areas in northern KwaZulu/Natal, it was in fact very difficult to organise for the ANC and that prominent members of the Inkatha Freedom Party did in fact restrict the political freedom of association of the ANC in those</p>

<p class="line" id="line937"><a name="pos937"></a>MR WILLS	174	ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line938"><a name="pos938"></a>areas.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line939"><a name="pos939"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Isn't the impression created that he acted to revenge the death of his two brothers and his family?</p>
<p class="line" id="line940"><a name="pos940"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> That was a question I thought myself for some time.  Clearly there is that element where unfortunately his brothers were killed in the violence.  However, there are two reason why I think that it was not simply a personal revenge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line941"><a name="pos941"></a>	The first is that the very nature of the conflict in the area had in fact divided the Mzimela clan along political lines.  And had it not been this political division, his brothers would not have been killed in the first instance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line942"><a name="pos942"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Mr Wills, I am inclined to agree with you that we should differentiate between personal revenge and perhaps political motivated revenge, is that the point you are trying to make?</p>
<p class="line" id="line943"><a name="pos943"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> I don't think it is as simple as revenge.  I cannot deny that there is an element of revenge in the attack - in the applicant's motivation - but clearly it goes further than that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line944"><a name="pos944"></a>	The second point that I wanted to make is that he has  testified to the Commission that he was involved in organising for the ANC generally and that the deceased in this matter he saw as a major obstacle towards this organisation.  With those two factors I submit with respect that there was more to his actions than simply revenge, be it personal or political. </p>
<p class="line" id="line945"><a name="pos945"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Maybe in all fairness to your submissions, Mr Wills, with regard to the question whether or not it was not just purely for the purpose of revenge, I think your</p>
<p class="line" id="line946"><a name="pos946"></a>5B - 11.2	question/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line947"><a name="pos947"></a>MR WILLS	175	ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line948"><a name="pos948"></a>question was asked of him what he had hoped to achieve, and I think his answer shows that he had a greater objective than just a personal revenge, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line949"><a name="pos949"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> That is correct, I recall that now. Thank you for that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line950"><a name="pos950"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> And also I think twice, on my counting, he had said, rightly or wrongly, I don't know whether that is true, but twice on my counting he has said that the deceased had killed many comrades.  I don't know whether the accusation is true, but the applicant on two occasions has said that the deceased had killed many comrades.</p>
<p class="line" id="line951"><a name="pos951"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes, that is indeed the applicant's belief.</p>
<p class="line" id="line952"><a name="pos952"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> So you concede that there was an element of revenge in this matter, but it was against a background of political conflict.</p>
<p class="line" id="line953"><a name="pos953"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes, Mr Chairperson, that is indeed so.  I submit that as a result - the close relationship that existed between the applicant and his two brothers, he must have been very traumatised by their death.  However, in view of his political involvement, and the general political situation that pertained in that area, particularly emphasising the fact that the applicant was one of the first organisers for the ANC in that area, he was one of the prime movers which later in 1992 resulted in the formation of a branch structure, a formal branch structure.  I think that his evidence to the effect that his concern far exceeded the personal aspects of this tragedy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line954"><a name="pos954"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Isn't it also a case, as one we've had before, where one must not overlook the tribal politics involved.  One must not overlook the fact that he and his brothers were the sons of the previous Chief, were the</p>

<p class="line" id="line956"><a name="pos956"></a>MR WILLS	176 	ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line957"><a name="pos957"></a>people who would in the ordinary course of events have become the Chief and that there was apparently a deliberate attempt to kill the whole line.  Three of his brothers had been killed, including the elder brother who should have been the heir.  So it was not only just a personal family it was the line of the Chief's sons and that is one of the reasons I think he said he wanted to stop this killing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line958"><a name="pos958"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes, that is indeed so, Sir.  I think this is a particular tragedy in that it is a clear example of where different political persuasions have caused dramatic divisions within a family and line of Chiefs and obviously this has added to the intensity of the problem.</p>
<p class="line" id="line959"><a name="pos959"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> He said it had been decreed that all Chiefs had to be members of Inkatha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line960"><a name="pos960"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes, clearly his belief was to that extent.  I think the Committee can take judicial notice of the fact that by far the majority of Chiefs in KwaZulu/Natal are indeed Inkatha supporters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line961"><a name="pos961"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Is there anything you wish to say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line962"><a name="pos962"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Members of the Committee, all I want to say is according to the Act there should be full disclosure of the  act committed, and the act must be associated with a political objective.</p>
<p class="line" id="line963"><a name="pos963"></a>	In my opinion the applicant has made full disclosure of why and how he killed the deceased. </p>
<p class="line" id="line964"><a name="pos964"></a>	On the question of whether we can have evidence as to whether the deceased was involved in the killings of ANC, it is a fact that we may never know.   And we have no evidence to the contrary.  Even though the applicant was not acting under any orders, we cannot ignore the fact that unfortunately in the northern KwaZulu/Natal areas IFP and</p>

<p class="line" id="line968"><a name="pos968"></a>	I don't think it is my duty really to say whether amnesty can be granted against him.  I think that is clearly the Committee's function.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line969"><a name="pos969"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> But you can tell us if you think amnesty ought not to be granted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line970"><a name="pos970"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> I was just about to say I think the requirements of the Act have been met, but I reserve my opinion whether it ought not to or it ought to be granted.</p>

<p class="line" id="line972"><a name="pos972"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Ms Thabethe, I thought you earlier on opened your submissions by stating that in your opinion the applicant had complied with the requirements of the Act.</p>

It happened on 23 June 1991.</p>

<p class="line" id="line988"><a name="pos988"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Were they informed that they are entitled to representation and that they could get Legal Aid?</p>
<p class="line" id="line989"><a name="pos989"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> As far as I know from the Durban IU they were informed and we did send Form 2 to the prisons informing them that they can get legal representation if they want to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line990"><a name="pos990"></a>So yes, they were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line991"><a name="pos991"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Were the other people who were convicted with them informed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line992"><a name="pos992"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Or have they applied?</p>
<p class="line" id="line993"><a name="pos993"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Unfortunately I don't have that information.  I don't know if they did apply or not, but as far as I know I don't have any information to that effect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line994"><a name="pos994"></a>	Mr Ashley says he has called the Durban office to find out if there are any applications, but as far as we know in Cape Town we haven't received any.  </p>

<p class="line" id="line996"><a name="pos996"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Sorry, before that.  What are they applying for amnesty for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line997"><a name="pos997"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Member of the Committee, actually it is the first question I would like to ask them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line998"><a name="pos998"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> We would like to know before we hear it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line999"><a name="pos999"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> What do they say on the application form?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1003"><a name="pos1003"></a>of Gumbi's application, the translated version.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1004"><a name="pos1004"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> I have great difficulty.  He there says:  "What I did resulted in my arrest, namely murder and I committed this crime".  It would appear there he is referring to a single crime ... attempted murder and six counts of murder.  But as I read it Zuma was also convicted of robbery with aggravating circumstances.  Is he applying for amnesty in respect of that?  Aren't these matters that must be clarified before the application can be heard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1005"><a name="pos1005"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> As I said before, I was going to clarify that when I lead evidence what crimes are they applying for, because from their applications they are talking of crimes that they did, but it is not clear which ones they are referring to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1006"><a name="pos1006"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> I think in fairness, so that their own minds are focused when they are giving evidence on the crimes for which they are in fact applying for amnesty, that you should take those details from them now before we start the hearing.  Take the particulars of the people who were involved, the victims and the circumstances.  As things stand, when we have before us among the papers, part of their application form in one of the official languages and part of it translated into English, and yet there does not seem to be sufficient clarity on precisely what offences because if we are required to give amnesty we can only do so in respect of specific offences.   I think that should be cleared up before you start leading evidence and you can then tell us before you start leading evidence as to what the offences are in respect of each one of them.   Will you do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1007"><a name="pos1007"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> I will do that.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1017"><a name="pos1017"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> This happened many years ago and the applicant and others were charged on a number of counts and most probably they won't even know the names of the individual houses.

<p class="line" id="line1032"><a name="pos1032"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Speaking for myself, I think it will be a futile exercise to expect the attorney to come the next day or the day after without having had any consultation with his clients without any concept of the enormity of the matter and the importance of it for him to be adequately prepared so that they can have their case sufficiently well presented.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1038"><a name="pos1038"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER:</span> No, we were not represented by him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1039"><a name="pos1039"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Who was representing you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1040"><a name="pos1040"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER:</span> It was Blomkampf.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1041"><a name="pos1041"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Did you try to ask Blomkampf to appear on your behalf?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1042"><a name="pos1042"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER:</span> No, we did not request him because he is from the Legal Aid Centre.  We thought that the attorney of the organisation would represent us as we had already contacted him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1043"><a name="pos1043"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Members of the Committee, one more concern that was raised by the applicants to me is the fact that if they miss this opportunity they don't know when they are going to get an opportunity to appear in front of the Committee.  I stressed that it is not going to be in their best interest to appear without legal representation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1044"><a name="pos1044"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> On our present schedule, is there a date set down already for Kwa-Zulu/Natal?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1046"><a name="pos1046"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> May I take this opportunity to address you, Mr Zuma and Mr Gumbi, to just explain to you that this opportunity that you have been given today is a very important opportunity, but that does not mean that if your matter is not dealt with today and is postponed, you will not be able to get another chance before this Commission.  It is very important that you be made aware that the legal requirements that you must meet to show that your deeds or your transgressions are with regard to political activity or your past political activity.  So if your legal</p>

<p class="line" id="line1049"><a name="pos1049"></a>representative is not present who will be able to help you in rendering your testimony and telling this Committee with regard to those political activities, and that the legal requirements that govern this Committee should be met fully or should be dealt with extensively.  That this opportunity</p>
<p class="line" id="line1050"><a name="pos1050"></a>is for real and you should not waste it. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1051"><a name="pos1051"></a>	When you come before this Committee you see how many papers or how much documentation we have in front of us and this documentation as you are sitting there you must also have it.  You will not be able to relate to this committee with regard to the offences if you do not have the necessary documentation.  Even your attorney, if you do get one, should be furnished with the necessary documentation and be able to conduct a consultation with you so that he can be able to represent you fruitfully.  So you must not be in a hurry to go on with the matter without legal representation.  We realise that it would not be in your best interests for us to do so. We hope that whatever I have explained to you is clear. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1052"><a name="pos1052"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER:</span> Yes, it is clear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1053"><a name="pos1053"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Is there anything else that you want to say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1054"><a name="pos1054"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER:</span> There is nothing that we want to say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1055"><a name="pos1055"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Do you agree that Ms Thabethe's advice is quite sound that the matter should be postponed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1056"><a name="pos1056"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER:</span> Yes, we do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1057"><a name="pos1057"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> So that if the matter is postponed there should be some efforts that you get legal representation, Mr Hlengwe, or whoever is going to appear on your behalf, will be able to be notified and you will also be notified on a date that is going to be set for the hearing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1058"><a name="pos1058"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER:</span> Yes, we would appreciate that.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1061"><a name="pos1061"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> The matter will be adjourned for the very, very sound and good reasons that have been given to you.  Every effort will be made to find a suitable date without too much delay though it is not possible today for me to tell you when that is going to be.  You will be given adequate notice of it and steps will be taken to ensure that you get legal assistance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1062"><a name="pos1062"></a>	Your matter is accordingly adjourned.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1063"><a name="pos1063"></a>	Ms Thabethe, what about the other interested parties who are present or who may be present here, namely dependents, relatives or victims.  Are you aware of whether any of them are present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1064"><a name="pos1064"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Members of the Committee, they have been present from yesterday because this matter was supposed to be heard yesterday.  I want to take this opportunity to apologise to them for wasting basically their time yesterday and today, but it is something that we could not foresee.  As they have heard for themselves that the applicants were thinking that somebody is going to come on their behalf, but it transpired today that this person is not here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1065"><a name="pos1065"></a>	So I would just like to apologise to them sincerely and inform them that we will let them know of the next date in time and we will pay all the costs for the travelling for today. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1066"><a name="pos1066"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Must we ensure that you have their names and the addresses to which the notice of the future hearing is sent?  We must make absolutely sure that we have that information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1067"><a name="pos1067"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> We do have that information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1068"><a name="pos1068"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> You may stand down.  Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1069"><a name="pos1069"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> The next matter is Hlophe on the roll, but Members of the Committee I think we have the same problem</p>

<p class="line" id="line1071"><a name="pos1071"></a>MS THABETHE	185	ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line1072"><a name="pos1072"></a>as today.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1073"><a name="pos1073"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Is Mr Hlophe here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1074"><a name="pos1074"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Mr Hlophe is here.  Should we call him in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1075"><a name="pos1075"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Yes.   Has he been shown the letter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1076"><a name="pos1076"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> I have shown him the letter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1077"><a name="pos1077"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Was he aware of it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1078"><a name="pos1078"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> He wasn't aware of it and he wasn't aware that his legal representative has withdrawn.   As a result, he heard of that yesterday and he says in the meantime he has contacted a legal representative to act on his behalf, but whoever he has called doesn't have the relevant documentation and that person hasn't consulted with him yet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1079"><a name="pos1079"></a>So we might have to postpone this one as well. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1080"><a name="pos1080"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Let him come in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1081"><a name="pos1081"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Do you know whether Mr Mbuyazi would be represented?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1082"><a name="pos1082"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> As far as I know, or as far as I am aware, he is not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1083"><a name="pos1083"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Are you Mr Msisi Hlophe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1084"><a name="pos1084"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1085"><a name="pos1085"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> You have made an application to the Amnesty Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1086"><a name="pos1086"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER:</span> That is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1087"><a name="pos1087"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Have you seen this letter that has been written?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1088"><a name="pos1088"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1089"><a name="pos1089"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Were you aware of that letter or its contents?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1090"><a name="pos1090"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER:</span> Yes, I read it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1091"><a name="pos1091"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Did you know that your advocate, Mr Mongezi Shongweni, has indicated that you do not propose to proceed with your application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1092"><a name="pos1092"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER:</span> Yes, I did hear that, but I want to say to this</p>
<p class="line" id="line1093"><a name="pos1093"></a>1A - 12.2	Commission/...</p>

<p class="line" id="line1095"><a name="pos1095"></a>Commission I have no knowledge thereof, but there was some disagreement between me and the advocate so that is what resulted in the whole confusion because I wanted to be given safety at the prison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1096"><a name="pos1096"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Have you now got somebody else to represent you, another lawyer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1097"><a name="pos1097"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER:</span> No, I do not have.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1098"><a name="pos1098"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Have you not consulted another lawyer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1099"><a name="pos1099"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER:</span> No, I haven't seen another attorney, besides the fact that I spoke to a certain attorney and said that maybe we have some minor disagreement, but he said to me he would come back to me although I did explain that I am supposed to appear today.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1100"><a name="pos1100"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Did you say there was an attorney that you phoned yesterday or today so that he could represent you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1101"><a name="pos1101"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER:</span> No, I did not say that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1102"><a name="pos1102"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> What is the position today, do you wish to proceed with your application in the absence or without the assistance of an attorney?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1103"><a name="pos1103"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER:</span> I wouldn't be able to represent myself.  I think I do need a legal representative and I would appreciate it if Mongezi could represent me because he is the one who knows a lot with regard to this matter and if I take another attorney I would have to start afresh.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1104"><a name="pos1104"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> We will adjourn this matter as well.   From what you tell us there might have been some misunderstanding between you and Mr Shongweni and I have no doubt that you will take all the necessary steps to clear whatever differences there are or misunderstandings you have with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1105"><a name="pos1105"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER:</span> Yes, I do understand that.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1108"><a name="pos1108"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> It means that your application cannot be heard now and it will have to be postponed to another day.  Can you tell us whether you will be taking the necessary steps to ensure that you will be legally represented?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1109"><a name="pos1109"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER:</span> Yes, I will make an effort to contact him and discuss it with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1110"><a name="pos1110"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> We cannot tell you at this stage to what date your case is postponed.  But every effort will be made to try and hear it as soon as possible.  Do you understand that?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1124"><a name="pos1124"></a>inconvenience of not being able to hear Mr Hlophe's case because Hlophe's attorney wrote us a letter to say that he will  not be able to represent Hlophe today and he further stated that Hlophe said he will not be able to appear before the Commission, as you have already heard Hlophe speaking.  There was some misunderstanding between himself and his attorney and therefore I apologise to members of the family of the victims.  This was beyond our control and it was unforeseeable. </p>

<p class="line" id="line1171"><a name="pos1171"></a>	Then in March 1991 they came back to launch another attack and that's where they started shooting us and we ran to Durban and an office in Natal got us a place at Inanda where we stayed together with other comrades.  We stayed the rest of 1991 and we discussed as to how we were going to get a suitable school because we wanted to go back to school.   And the offices of the ANC said they would try in 1992 and get us a school.  So we stayed for the rest of 1991 without going to school. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1172"><a name="pos1172"></a>	The Southern Natal office sent Mr Nduli to accompany us so that we could look for a school.  Then we went to the school and they gave us a car to transport us as members of the ANC.  We got to the school and Mr Nduli went to the headmaster.  We were inside the car at that time.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1173"><a name="pos1173"></a>	After quite some time members of the IFP came to that school.  They were armed and at that time Mr Nduli was speaking to the Headmaster.  They wanted to shoot at us and the driver kept on pleading with them not to shoot at us and the driver actually was able to dissuade them from launching an attack upon us.  Then the Headmaster came out and told them that they would rather shoot him than shoot us and they ultimately were persuaded ...</p>

<p class="line" id="line1178"><a name="pos1178"></a>when he came out he discovered that the IFP members were now threatening us and they were chasing us out of the school yard and we were not able to go and register for that particular year.  So we left that place and went back to Inanda. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1179"><a name="pos1179"></a>	And at Inanda we convened a meeting and we tried to reach a resolution as to how we were going to get a suitable school where we would not be disturbed.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1180"><a name="pos1180"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Mr Khanyile, what school is this and in what area was this school?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1181"><a name="pos1181"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> It is at Eskolile Bamshela.  The place is called Oswatini.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1182"><a name="pos1182"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUBONI:</span> Sorry Mr Khanyile, try to look also at me.  I will try to direct the speed at which you are giving evidence.  If I am lifting my hand it is indicating slow down.  You can proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1183"><a name="pos1183"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Then we convened a meeting together with other comrades that we should get a suitable place where we could stay and also attend school.  Then we planned together with the ANC office and they advised us that they did have a place where we could stay and they also borrowed us a car that would take us and we were left at Xele's place.  That's where we stayed together with other members of the ANC.  It is at Bamshayela Oswatini.  The village is called Bamshayela but the place is Oswatini.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1184"><a name="pos1184"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUBONI:</span> When was this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1185"><a name="pos1185"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> It was in 1992, February the 28th.   We stayed there and we waited for the beginning of the year so that we can register and there were some other members of the ANC in that place.  They went to the Headmaster to try and negotiate so that we could start our school term the</p>

<p class="line" id="line1189"><a name="pos1189"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Where did they come to, did they come to Xele's place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1190"><a name="pos1190"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1191"><a name="pos1191"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> The 10th May 1992 they came and attacked you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1192"><a name="pos1192"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> That is correct.  They shot in the air but nobody was injured.  They came back on the following day, that was on the 11th May and they attempted to attack Xele's place.  And at that time there were many of them, members of the IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1193"><a name="pos1193"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Sorry, Mr Kuboni, is the witness telling us what is relevant to his application?  He is applying for the murder which was committed on the 18th March 1992.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1205"><a name="pos1205"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I am talking about March.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1207"><a name="pos1207"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> They came on a Wednesday.  They had come to attack.  It was a large group and we were at Xele's house in Bamshayela where we were staying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1208"><a name="pos1208"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUBONI:</span> Was it the Wednesday in March or what month was it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1209"><a name="pos1209"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I don't remember quite well, but it was in 1992.  It was before the attack on the Nqobo family.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1210"><a name="pos1210"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUBONI:</span> What happened after that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1211"><a name="pos1211"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Then a fight broke out and they were attacking us and Mr Xele went out and he came back to tell us that we must come and see, there was a large group of people approaching and this large group was attacking Mr Nqobo's place.  And we went out.  And when we went to the yard, the members of the IFP started shooting.  And this happened up until one o'clock during the day.  They ran away and we also came back.  Then the following day they came to attack in the afternoon.  They even burnt Mr Xele's house.  That is where we were staying and they shot, we ran for our lives.  We went to report to the police station that we were being attacked.  The police took us in a van to go and investigate the matter.  They left us along the road, but they did not go to the Xele house.  They went back without investigating the matter.  They didn't help us in any way and on that day</p>

<p class="line" id="line1214"><a name="pos1214"></a>we did not sleep in the house.  Then on Saturday whilst we were at the mountains hiding, certain people came and they said we should go and have a look because there was dead men and when we went to look, we found out that he was one of us.  And the police came at that time and said that we should help them carry the corpse in to the car. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1215"><a name="pos1215"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUBONI:</span> You are talking about the Saturday of the same week in which the shooting took place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1216"><a name="pos1216"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1217"><a name="pos1217"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUBONI:</span> You can proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1218"><a name="pos1218"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> After we had put the corpse in the car the police took the corpse with and we  stayed in the mountains because we didn't know where to go.  Then on Sunday morning, the very same week, we went to see Mr Xele's house.  And just as we were trying to collect our belongings to see whether we still had any left, we discovered that there was nothing left except for ashes.  One member of the ANC came to report to us that another group was attacking his house.  I went together with him.  We went to his home to see what damage was being done and when we got there we discovered that the house was in flames and we saw three members of the IFP who were burning the house and we started fighting and shooting at each other.  The IFP members ran away.  They got to Nqobo's house.  These members of the IFP who were running got into Mr Nqobo's house and they were actually shooting at us from inside the house and we shot back;  after quite some time we stopped shooting at each other.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1219"><a name="pos1219"></a>	After I had stopped shooting, proceeding home, two kids came out of Nqobo's house.  I was having the gun in my hand.  I asked them as to where the people who were shooting were and the children did not answer me.  I could see that they</p>

<p class="line" id="line1222"><a name="pos1222"></a>were in a state of shock.  I had a problem.  I could not go inside because I was scared of the people who shot at us.  Because I did not know whether the people were still there or they had run away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1223"><a name="pos1223"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUBONI:</span> I understand that on this day you had a gun.  Where did you get this gun?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1224"><a name="pos1224"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Our brothers who were members of the ANC brought the guns.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1225"><a name="pos1225"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> When you say "our brothers", do they have any names?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1226"><a name="pos1226"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> It was Mzi Dhlamini.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1227"><a name="pos1227"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUBONI:</span> Did he tell you where he got them from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1228"><a name="pos1228"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> He said he got them from the organisation, but he did not elaborate.  He said he was not allowed to tell us all the details because they were going to be arrested.   I am referring to the ANC organisation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1229"><a name="pos1229"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUBONI:</span> When you attacked the Nqobo Kraal, how many were you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1230"><a name="pos1230"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> We were six.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1231"><a name="pos1231"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> You have been telling us about the two kids.a  Is that not relevant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1232"><a name="pos1232"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUBONI:</span> Pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1233"><a name="pos1233"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> He has been telling us about the two children coming out of the house and speaking to him.  Isn't that relevant because you are now speaking to an attack on the house.  I don't know if you can hear me.  He has been telling us about two children coming from the house and he enquired something from them and then you interrupted him and now you are asking him about the attack on Nqobo's house.  Isn't the story about the children relevant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1234"><a name="pos1234"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUBONI:</span> If I understand his testimony, his testimony</p>
<p class="line" id="line1235"><a name="pos1235"></a>1A - 13.2	is/..</p>
<p class="line" id="line1236"><a name="pos1236"></a>MR KUBONI	197	MR M H KHANYILE</p>
<p class="line" id="line1237"><a name="pos1237"></a>is that there was an exchange of fire and then the people whom they were following, whom they were fighting with were inside the house.  So when the kids got out of the house they wanted to find out from them whether these people were still inside.  So I think the question of the kids really feature that way.  In fact, the reason why I came in at this stage, I wanted him to clarify some of the issues relating the attack before he can go on with his testimony. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1238"><a name="pos1238"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Mr Kuboni though, I think the witness was still explaining.  I think his evidence was to the effect that he asked the children the names of the children who were inside the house and who were shooting and he was still going on with that evidence when you interrupted him.  So he has not yet furnished us - because I would imagine that the children must have responded to his enquiry with regard to the names of the people who were in the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1239"><a name="pos1239"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUBONI:</span> Mr Khanyile, can you then proceed from where I interrupted you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1240"><a name="pos1240"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Let's be more specific.  He told you about two children who came out of the house.  They were in a state of shock.  He asked them some questions, you then went and asked him where did you get your gun from.  There was a break in sequence.  You should take his story about what happened after he spoke to the kids, what happened next?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1241"><a name="pos1241"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUBONI:</span> After you have seen these kids coming out from the house, then what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1242"><a name="pos1242"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> We asked the children who were coming from the house as to where the people who were attacking us are, did they get into the house or run away.  They did not answer me.  I could see that they were in a state of shock, so I could not go into the house because I did not know as to</p>

<p class="line" id="line1245"><a name="pos1245"></a>what I would come across in the house.  So we left that place without knowing whether there were any dead people inside the house. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1246"><a name="pos1246"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> So somebody went into the house, is that what you were saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1247"><a name="pos1247"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> No, we never went into the house.  Then from there we left to our place.  We stayed for quite a few moments and then later on police came and they called out a list of names and in this list my name was also there and I did not realise that where we were, there were people who were injured where we attacked, there were people who were injured or who died.  I stayed for three days and the detectives from Greytown came who were investigating that matter of murder and robbery.  That is when I got to know that the Nqobo family members had been shot and I was told that it was three people.  I told them that I have no knowledge thereof because I never went into the house to discover the corpses.  As a result I did not know what had happened inside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1248"><a name="pos1248"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> ... these people when they attacked the Nqobo house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1249"><a name="pos1249"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> That is correct, there were six.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1250"><a name="pos1250"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> And you have confirmed none of them went into the house.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1253"><a name="pos1253"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> The others were standing and they were keeping watch as to whether there weren't any people coming out of the house and I was launching the attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1254"><a name="pos1254"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> None of your companions fired at the house.  You</p>

<p class="line" id="line1257"><a name="pos1257"></a>were the only one. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1258"><a name="pos1258"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Yes, I am the one who shot.  When I was at the police station the detectives from Greytown came and I explained to them that I had no knowledge that people had died and they thought that I was hiding something.  And I proceeded to tell them that we were shooting from the outside and we did not go into the house and after the shooting stopped, only two children came out of the house and I asked these children as to where the people were who were attacking and the children did not answer me.  From there we left without getting into the house to see how much damage had been done.  They asked me about guns and we had hidden the guns, but the police could not get the guns, even after having assaulted me, then we proceeded to the case.  Up till such time the matter was referred to the Supreme Court at Mtunzini.  That's where they accused me of having killed three people and apparently there were people who survived the attack and I was convicted at the Supreme Court in Mtunzini.   I really regret this because the people who got injured were not the ones that we were chasing.  These were innocent victims who were not involved in the whole conflict between the ANC and the IFP and I would like to sincerely apologise to the Nqobo family that I killed the members of the family.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1265"><a name="pos1265"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> When the members of the IFP came, that is the ones who had burnt Mr Luthuli's house, that's when we were called and we were chasing them, and when we were chasing them they ran into the Nqobo house and at the time that he was in the yard he shot at us and they got Skwayi Nqobo, that is Mr Nqobo's son who got into the house.  He was an IFP member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1266"><a name="pos1266"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> The purpose was for you to get these guys and kill them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1267"><a name="pos1267"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Yes, we were chasing the members of Inkatha who had launched an attack on us and now we were launching a counter attack.  They ran into Nqobo's house and they shot from the inside of the house.  Our aim was that we wanted to kill the IFP members who had shot our many members.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1282"><a name="pos1282"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Some of the members were waiting at the kraal looking out for some escapees but I personally was at the yard, inside the yard and not inside the kraal.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1284"><a name="pos1284"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> That is correct, I was in the yard and not in the kraal.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1286"><a name="pos1286"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> There were some who went into the kraal but some others were looking out on other areas of the yard so that the escapees be able to escape.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1287"><a name="pos1287"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> When you were talking about the kraal, do you mean the house or do you mean the house and the surroundings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1288"><a name="pos1288"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> There was a cattle kraal in the house.  I was in the yard and that's where I was launching my attack.  I was shooting into the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1289"><a name="pos1289"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> I want to clarify that when we are talking about the kraal, I understand that the Nqobo Kraal includes the yard.  I mean we are not talking about the cattle kraal.  We are not talking about the kraal for the cattle, we are</p>

<p class="line" id="line1292"><a name="pos1292"></a>talking about the Nqobo Kraal where the victims were stabbed. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1293"><a name="pos1293"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> I am sorry, I personally find this confusing.  The witness, when he speaks of the kraal, he means a cattle kraal and there is a house and there is a yard.  I assume the house is inside the yard, maybe it is a fenced yard.  Now you want to introduce a further concept of a kraal other than a cattle kraal.  How are you going to fit that in?  Do you want to distinguish between a yard, a cattle kraal and then kraal in another concept?  Is this not just becoming complicated now?  I don't understand this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1294"><a name="pos1294"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> That is why I thought we should clarify whether  ....(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1295"><a name="pos1295"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> It is clear.   There is a cattle kraal, there is a hut, there is a yard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1296"><a name="pos1296"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUBONI:</span> Is  it not better then to avoid the concept of a kraal, to just use the house and the yard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1297"><a name="pos1297"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Isn't one of the problems the fact that in the judgment the Judge refers to this witness giving evidence that they went via the Zulu kraal to the Nqobo kraal.  That clearly is not a reference to cattle kraals.  That is just a kraal as a housing unit, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1298"><a name="pos1298"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Including the surrounding land.   I think we should just simplify it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1299"><a name="pos1299"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Can I simplify it.  If you look at page 5 of the judgment, paragraph 2, it says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1300"><a name="pos1300"></a>"While he and his group waited outside they heard gunshots from inside the kraal".</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1301"><a name="pos1301"></a>So we can't assume it was coming from the cattle kraal.  It was coming from the house. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1302"><a name="pos1302"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> I understand that.  I have no problems with</p>

<p class="line" id="line1305"><a name="pos1305"></a>that.  It is clear to me that when the judgment speaks of a kraal it is not talking about a cattle kraal.  I understood the concept of the yard to be synonomous with the kraal.  I wouldn't try to distinguish between a yard and a kraal.  You see what I mean.  Now I thought you were trying to distinguish between a kraal and a yard.  Is there a difference between somebody's yard and somebody's kraal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1306"><a name="pos1306"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> That is what I thought I should clarify.  That a kraal includes a yard and house and then you have a kraal which means it is the whole area.  What I wanted to find out is by saying they entered the kraal, did they enter the yard but not the house, or what does he mean?  We are not talking about the cattle kraal because it is not relevant here.  That is not where the attacks occurred.  So I thought maybe it is important for us to clarify what we mean by kraal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1307"><a name="pos1307"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Will you please ask the applicant whether any of his companions entered the house?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1310"><a name="pos1310"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Can you explain how Thandazani and Peter were stabbed then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1311"><a name="pos1311"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Thandazani and Peter went out through a certain door, but I do not know whether when they were running they got injured inside.  I don't know what injured them because nobody went inside.  But what I suspect was that probably when they were trying to escape they were either cut by something but we did not participate in stabbing them because we had guns.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1317"><a name="pos1317"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> What is it that you want the witness to explain?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1318"><a name="pos1318"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Maybe I should rephrase my question.  According to the judgment Peter saw you shooting at a close range.  He saw you firing at all those present in the room.  So can you explain that to us?  Are you saying he was lying, since you didn't get into the house?  Can you explain how that happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1319"><a name="pos1319"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I was shooting from the outside.  I was close to the window, but I did not see the people who were inside because they were inside, shots were coming from the inside of the house and I was firing into the house.  And Peter came, after I had stopped shooting, because the people who were attacking us from inside had also seized the attack on us.  So I asked him as to where the people who attacked us were but he did not answer me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1320"><a name="pos1320"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> But what is being put to you is that the evidence that was led, according to the judgment, is that he said  he saw you come into the doorway of the room and saw you firing at all those present in the room, that is from the doorway of the room.  You heard that evidence at your trial didn't you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1321"><a name="pos1321"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Yes, I did hear that evidence, but I did explain that I never went into the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1322"><a name="pos1322"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> ... Peter gave evidence that you did go into the house, that you show him and you shot Thandazani in the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1323"><a name="pos1323"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> No, that is not true.  I was shooting from the outside of the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1324"><a name="pos1324"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Peter also gave evidence that you pulled the</p>

<p class="line" id="line1327"><a name="pos1327"></a>trigger and the firearm wouldn't go off at a stage and then you said to him that he was lucky that he had been saved and thereupon you left.  Did you ever speak to him and say to him that he has been lucky to be saved?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1328"><a name="pos1328"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I think Peter was confused.  I asked him as to where the people who were attacking us were.  But he did not answer me.  That is when I saw that he was in a state of shock, so I never went on further to ask any questions.  He saw the gun that I was having.  I was pointing towards the house because I thought at that time the people were still in there and they were going to come out.  Maybe he thought I wanted to shoot him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1329"><a name="pos1329"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> ... you say there were gunshots coming from the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1330"><a name="pos1330"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> That is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1331"><a name="pos1331"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> ... inside the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1332"><a name="pos1332"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I believe it was Skwayi from the Nqobo family, that is the people who were chasing us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1333"><a name="pos1333"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> My question was, they were shooting from the house.  Who do they believe was shooting from the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1334"><a name="pos1334"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I believed it was Skwayi Nqobo who was a member of the IFP.  He was hiding inside the house, shooting at us from inside the house, and I was launching an attack from outside the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1335"><a name="pos1335"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> You know Skwayi Nqobo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1336"><a name="pos1336"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I also know Nqopeni Zulu.  I did not know the third one's name.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1338"><a name="pos1338"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I had no idea that there were other people inside the house because I was concentrating mainly on the members of Inkatha who were attacking us and they even</p>

<p class="line" id="line1344"><a name="pos1344"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> If you were chasing these people who shot at you as you say at the Luthuli kraal, why did you tell the trial court that you heard gunshots from inside the kraal which surprised you greatly?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1348"><a name="pos1348"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Why did you then in that event tell the trial court that while you were waiting outside the kraal you heard gunshots and this surprised you greatly.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1422"><a name="pos1422"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Did you hear no screams from inside the house after you shot these women and children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1423"><a name="pos1423"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I did hear some noise, but it was from these children who were actually screaming, the  two children that I referred to before.  But when the shooting was still taking place I could not hear any noise in the house.   I only heard the noise after the shooting had ceased.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1424"><a name="pos1424"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Mr Khanyile, in your evidence  you have stated quite clearly that you saw amongst others Skwayi and the Zulu person whom you found burning the Luthuli house.  You gave chase after them and in the process you fired at  one another.  So you knew that there were three people inside that house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1425"><a name="pos1425"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Yes, I saw two getting into the house, but I am not sure about the third one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1426"><a name="pos1426"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> It was in the same house where Peter Nqobo came from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1427"><a name="pos1427"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1428"><a name="pos1428"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Mr Khanyile, do you believe that the people who were shot, that is the two women and the children, were the ones who were shooting at you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1429"><a name="pos1429"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> No, they were not the ones who were shooting at me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1430"><a name="pos1430"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Did you managed to shoot Mr Zulu and Mr Nqobo?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1432"><a name="pos1432"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I was not able to shoot them because I was outside the house, they were inside and I was just returning fire thinking that I would hit them or I would be able to get one of them or two of them ...

<p class="line" id="line1460"><a name="pos1460"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> When were the guns brought?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1461"><a name="pos1461"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> The guns were delivered later while we were staying at Xele's place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1462"><a name="pos1462"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> How many guns?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1463"><a name="pos1463"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> There were seven guns.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1464"><a name="pos1464"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Why were you the only one who was armed on this day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1465"><a name="pos1465"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> The other guns which were available were far too big and the other two small ones had been taken by other members of our group.  So the big ones were hidden because the police were troubling us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1466"><a name="pos1466"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Mr Khanyile, I have only one question to put to you.  I want to know whether it was the modus operandi of the ANC in your area to launch retaliatory attacks against the IFP indiscriminately.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1467"><a name="pos1467"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> We were not attacking indiscriminately.  We were attacking Inkatha members and the situation actually forced us to actually defend ourselves when we were being attacked by Inkatha members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1468"><a name="pos1468"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Did you not foresee the possibility that there might be small children and women in the house that you so ferociously attacked?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1472"><a name="pos1472"></a>number of houses or rondawels and when we got there I thought or generally thought that they had got into that particular house that I attacked.  As a result I thought probably the other members of the family were in the other rondawels. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1473"><a name="pos1473"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> I am asking you again Mr Khanyile which you have not answered.  Could you not have foreseen that there might be a possibility of small children and women being in that house which you attacked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1474"><a name="pos1474"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> No, it never occurred to me that there could be children and women, because the members of the IFP who got into that particular rondawel shot from the inside so  I thought they were all by themselves.  That is why they were able to shoot at us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1475"><a name="pos1475"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> One last point.  Had you been to the Zulu kraal before you went to this kraal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1476"><a name="pos1476"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I don't think I understand the question.  Would you please repeat it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1477"><a name="pos1477"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> From the Luthuli kraal had you been to the Zulu kraal before you went to the Nqobo kraal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1478"><a name="pos1478"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> We went to the Zulu place after they had attacked.  There were some who went to the Zulu kraal.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1480"><a name="pos1480"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> As I have explained before, that on Friday we were attacked and the house was burnt.  That's when we ran away.  And after they had burnt the house we went to the police station where we were not helped by the police, then we went to the Nqobo place to launch an attack because the police were not helping us.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1485"><a name="pos1485"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Yes, we went to the Zulu kraal after they attacked Xele's place, then we went to Zulu.  That was on Friday, not on Sunday.  It was after the event of burning the Xele's house, we went to the police and we couldn't get any help, therefore we went to the Zulu kraal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1486"><a name="pos1486"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> To attack that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1487"><a name="pos1487"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1488"><a name="pos1488"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> I am reading out of the judgment, and the Judge says that at your trial you told him</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1489"><a name="pos1489"></a>"On the morning in question small boys came and reported that the Luthuli kraal was burning.  The Luthuli's were also ANC supporters.  They were told that one Skwayi Nqobo and one Mkupeni Zulu were responsible for this".</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1490"><a name="pos1490"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> That is correct, we even saw them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1491"><a name="pos1491"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> ... then went on to say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1492"><a name="pos1492"></a>"They then set off in pursuit of these men.  In his evidence in chief he said "we ran to find them".  They went via the Zulu kraal to the Nqobo kraal".</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1493"><a name="pos1493"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> No, that is not correct.  The event that took place at Zulu was on Friday, not on Sunday.  They didn't run to Zulu, they went straight to Nqobo's place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1494"><a name="pos1494"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> ... say you didn't go to the Zulu kraal.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1496"><a name="pos1496"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> ... heard shots being fired from that direction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1497"><a name="pos1497"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I can't say that because when we were firing shots, the Zulu's place is not far from Nqobo, so when you are coming from Luthuli going to Nqobo's place you will pass</p>

<p class="line" id="line1509"><a name="pos1509"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> ... they were firing guns.  You said "we were firing guns all the way" and the question was "who was we"?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1512"><a name="pos1512"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I had one full magazine and the other one.  In other words I had two, 16-16, 32 all in all.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1515"><a name="pos1515"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> There is one other question I want to ask you.  You remember the evidence of Peter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1516"><a name="pos1516"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Yes, I do, but not everything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1517"><a name="pos1517"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Peter said at the trial that he, Peter, "dragged Thandazani under the bed, but in the process Thandazani was shot in the arm, whereupon the accused (that</p>

The accused said to him that he was lucky that he had been saved.  Thereupon the accused left".  Do you agree with this version, or don't you agree with this version?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1521"><a name="pos1521"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I don't agree.   I would like to put it this way.  I was outside.  I never got inside the house.  I didn't realise that I shot Thandazani.   I even left there without knowing.  I only heard about it in court.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1522"><a name="pos1522"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> What about the evidence of Peter, that you attempted to shoot him and the gun didn't go off?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1523"><a name="pos1523"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Peter saw the gun in my hand and then he thought that I was going to shoot him.  The only thing I asked Peter was that where were those guys who were attacking us from inside the house.  Maybe he thought I wanted to shoot him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1524"><a name="pos1524"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> I put to you earlier that Peter had been shot.  I think I was mistaken in that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1525"><a name="pos1525"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Mr Khanyile, when you spoke to Peter and Thandazani, did you notice anything on Thandazani that might have indicated to you that he was injured by the time that you spoke to them?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1546"><a name="pos1546"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> So were you just shooting blindly through the window?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1547"><a name="pos1547"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Yes, that is true, because I was returning fire.  I saw from which direction the fire came and I returned fire also, but I had absolutely no knowledge as to who was inside.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1553"><a name="pos1553"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> At the time I had no knowledge as to what room they were occupying, so I was just shooting at random at times and at times I would wait for the fire to see as to which direction it was coming from.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1554"><a name="pos1554"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Were you shooting into different rooms or were you merely shooting through the same window the whole time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1555"><a name="pos1555"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I was standing at the window next to the door.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1556"><a name="pos1556"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> How far from the window was the door?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1557"><a name="pos1557"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> As I am indicating.  The window is where I am sitting and the door would be at the table that I am indicating.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1558"><a name="pos1558"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Two and a half metres.  And yet in this indiscriminate shooting you say where you were shooting through curtains, not knowing what you were aiming at, you managed to hit the one person six times, the other two people three times each and a little boy who was being pulled under a bed, you shot him through the arm.  Is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1559"><a name="pos1559"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> As I have already explained, that I didn't know in which room they were.  Whether they were maybe below the window or next to the door, they could have been somewhere there, maybe that's how I got them.  Because I could not see anybody inside the house at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1560"><a name="pos1560"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> I think I must indicate to you Mr Khanyile, that was far as I am concerned I do not think you are being honest or frank with the Court in this regard and that you are accordingly not complying with the provisions of the</p>

There seem to be some serious improbabilities in his evidence, from which one may draw the conclusion that he has not made a full and frank disclosure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1565"><a name="pos1565"></a>	Bearing that in mind you have the opportunity of clearing up what you might consider to be important matters when you re-examine him.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1566"><a name="pos1566"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Before you re-examine, can I just also deal with another problem which you may wish to address when you re-examine.  Mr Khanyile, your evidence before us is that when you and your friends followed the three people, you were the only one who was armed amongst your friends.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1567"><a name="pos1567"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Yes, that is true.  I was the only one who was armed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1568"><a name="pos1568"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> And the three people who you are pursuing were armed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1569"><a name="pos1569"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I saw Skwayi having a firearm as well as Mqupeni Zulu.  I did not see the third one whether he was armed or not, but I did not see anything.  I think I did not see anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1570"><a name="pos1570"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> ... you were asked what you meant by saying "we were firing guns ...". (CHANGE OVER TO TAPE 2B) ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1571"><a name="pos1571"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> The one I was actually aiming at was Skwayi Zulu and he was also returning fire and Mqupeni did have a firearm.  He was also shooting, but apparently he was not shooting at me.  I think he was attacking the other two members with which I was travelling.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1574"><a name="pos1574"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Then you were asked what you meant by saying "we were firing guns", you said you are referring to yourself and all the three other people that you were pursuing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1575"><a name="pos1575"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I was firing and they were also firing, but I wanted Skwayi Nqobo.  Mqupeni Zulu was shooting the other two males.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1576"><a name="pos1576"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> If you say the third person was also firing, surely you mean he was armed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1577"><a name="pos1577"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> The third one was not shooting at us.  It was the only the other two, Mqupeni Zulu and Skwayi Nqobo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1578"><a name="pos1578"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Why did you put him amongst the "we" when you were asked earlier on?  Why didn't you say that it was just Skwayi and Mqupeni only and yourself who were exchanging fire?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1579"><a name="pos1579"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I merely was referring to them, but I did not specifically say that all the three were shooting at me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1580"><a name="pos1580"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> You did say three of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1581"><a name="pos1581"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> They were not all shooting, only the two, because I did not see the third one's gun.  Only the two were shooting back, but I just counted them as three because they were together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1582"><a name="pos1582"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> ... if it was only yourself that was armed, and you and your friends were pursuing these people, how did you hope to engage people amongst whom two are armed, and in your group only one person is armed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1583"><a name="pos1583"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I was not afraid of them, that's why I decided to chase them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1584"><a name="pos1584"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> I am putting this question to you because as it was pointed to you earlier on the evidence against you during the trial was that you did not follow these people.  2B - 13.2	There/...</p>

<p class="line" id="line1586"><a name="pos1586"></a>There was no exchange of any fire between you and these people.  You only received a report that these were the people who had been responsible for the burning down of Mr Luthuli's house and you never saw them yourself and you never exchanged any fire with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1587"><a name="pos1587"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> In court I was not telling the truth because I was scared I would be convicted, but now I am convicted.  There is no reason for me to lie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1588"><a name="pos1588"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> ... speaking for myself, it looks a little bit improbable to me that you could have dared to engage people who had two firearms and you people had only one.  You went so far as to pursue them and follow them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1589"><a name="pos1589"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Mr Khanyile, before your attorney re-examines.  There seems to be a little discrepancy in your evidence with regard to how big a group you were.  I think in your evidence today before the Committee you indicated that you were a group of six, and in the evidence before your trial you indicated that you were a group of 12.  Now in response to questions put by Judge Ngoepe to you you stated that Mqupeni was shooting at the other two persons in your group.  Now if you were six, where were the other three persons who were supposed to be part of your group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1590"><a name="pos1590"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I said the two were having guns and shooting back.  We were six when this happened.  That is when I was shooting at Mqupeni Zulu and his friend.  The other five were also with us.  I was the sixth one.  I was referring to the IFP members that they were three and the two were shooting at us.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1596"><a name="pos1596"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> There were three corrugated iron houses and one rondawel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1597"><a name="pos1597"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUBONI:</span> And when you got in there, did you see these people you were following, to which room did they enter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1598"><a name="pos1598"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I saw them getting into a house and I know the house they got into.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1599"><a name="pos1599"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUBONI:</span> ... fire shots?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1600"><a name="pos1600"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1601"><a name="pos1601"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUBONI:</span> Whilst the shooting was still going on, were there any screams of people who were being affected?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1602"><a name="pos1602"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I could not hear any screams because there was a lot of gunfire and it made a loud sound.  I only heard the screaming from the two boys who came out of the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1603"><a name="pos1603"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUBONI:</span> One  member of the Committee, Judge Wilson, spoke about the bullets to Nomekemeza Nqobo, which were plus-minus eight and the bullets also to a two-year old and also to the 37-year old.  When did you hear about the eight bullets that penetrated them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1604"><a name="pos1604"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I never got to know as to how many bullets penetrated their bodies.  I only heard when the police told me that there were people who had died from gunshots, and as to how many bullets penetrated each person is the first time that I am hearing before this Committee.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1613"><a name="pos1613"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> I did pursue them and they got into the Nqobo household.  That is when they got into the house and they shot us from inside the house and I shot whilst I was outside the house.  I never went into the house.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1628"><a name="pos1628"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHANYILE:</span> Nobody gave us any instructions.  We were just sitting there waiting for whoever was going to launch an attack so that we would also launch a counter attack.

<p class="line" id="line1739"><a name="pos1739"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Is there anything you wish to draw our attention to in this matter in summing up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1740"><a name="pos1740"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> In summing up I would like to summarise whether I think in my submissions the applicant does require with the requirements of the Act with the question of full disclosure.  My opinion is that the version given at the trial court is very different from the version that we are told today, but the applicant explained that he had no obligation to tell the truth at the trial.  Still though, with the evidence which that he has given us today, there are a lot of inconsistencies.  And the applicant hasn't come out clearly to explain factors and questions put to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1741"><a name="pos1741"></a>	And just on the question of the children coming out and talking to the applicant.  I don't think it  is very likely that children who are in the house, a house that has just been shot at, can be so courageous to come out and actually speak to the person who has been doing the shooting.  But I don't know, it is just my opinion.  As I said before, the applicant does not seem to be a good speaker, if I may put it so.  It is like he is unable to explain himself and the sequence of events clearly.  So it is very difficult for me to make an opinion whether a full disclosure was made or not.  It is not convincing that it was, but I may be wrong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1742"><a name="pos1742"></a>	Then on the question of political objectivity.  We may not doubt the fact that the incident occurred during a time of ANC/IFP unrest in KwaZulu/Natal.  At the same time there</p>

<p class="line" id="line1744"><a name="pos1744"></a>MS THABETHE	232	ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line1745"><a name="pos1745"></a>is nothing which shows the connection or a causal link between the offence committed, that is the shooting of the two females and children, and the political objectivity sought to be achieved.  There is no connection between the two.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1746"><a name="pos1746"></a>	At the same time the applicant indicated that their purpose was to kill three IFP people who had attacked the Luthuli kraal.  However, I don't think that would justify the killing of the Nqobo family and children.  I am not clear as to what the political objective was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1747"><a name="pos1747"></a>	Thank you, Chairperson. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1748"><a name="pos1748"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUBONI:</span> Chairperson, at this stage what has to be decided is whether the Act has a political objective and whether the applicant has made a full disclosure.  It is my submission that the question of a full disclosure and the question of political objective are in a way interlinked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1749"><a name="pos1749"></a>	In my view, the applicant has done all in his power to disclose the events which took place on the day in question.  The question boils down to the question of probability of his version.  And the improbabilities that are pointed out is the question of shooting.  The improbabilities in his version mainly have to do with the question of the bullets that penetrated the children.  The child was there and also the two females were there.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1750"><a name="pos1750"></a>	In my view if the version of the applicant is accepted that there was a shooting from inside, surely it cannot be said with reasonable certainty which bullets that penetrated the deceased were really from the applicant. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1751"><a name="pos1751"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Could they have been from anyone else?  Are you suggesting anyone else fired shots which could have hit the people in the house?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1753"><a name="pos1753"></a>MR KUBONI	233	ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line1754"><a name="pos1754"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUBONI:</span> My point is, since it was still dawn, in his version there were people who were shooting from inside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1755"><a name="pos1755"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Are you seriously suggesting that we should have regard to the possibility that these people who were in the room were shot by other people in the room?  By their relations, not by a hostile group?  Are you seriously suggesting we should accept that as a possibility?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1756"><a name="pos1756"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUBONI:</span> What I am saying is, you cannot overrule that possibility, but in any case it is farfetched.  But given that there was turmoil or there was an exchange of fire, so they might have been caught in the cross-fire.  But what is obvious is that with the indiscriminate shooting of the applicant, anything is possible.   If the people who were being pursued, that is Mqupeni Zulu and Skwayi Nqobo, if they got into the house running, surely I don't think really that they would have time - they would have time to warn the people who were inside or also to check in what positions they were in, so surely they must have directed their attacks at the people who were inside, so the possibility really of shooting the people who were inside, it is not a possibility that we can completely overrule.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1757"><a name="pos1757"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> But is it a probability? You said we should deal with probabilities.  Do you think that it is a real probability that they have been shot by their own people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1758"><a name="pos1758"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUBONI:</span> It is not a probability, it is just a possibility.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1759"><a name="pos1759"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> You must bear in mind that it was light enough outside before they came to the house for the applicant to recognise the people he was pursuing.  There was sufficient daylight for him to do that.  So we are not talking about a black, dark room.  This was in the morning</p>

<p class="line" id="line1763"><a name="pos1763"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUBONI:</span> Yes, it was in the morning.  What is obvious from this version is that since there was this shooting the possibilities that - since there was this shooting, he didn't foresee that the three deceased were inside the house.  Their political aim was to kill the people who were there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1764"><a name="pos1764"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> He has been found guilty of murder;  he has already been found guilty of shooting those people and the probabilities and the possibilities of their death being caused in  some other way is now an academic issue, is it not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1765"><a name="pos1765"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUBONI:</span> I didn't hear the last part.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1766"><a name="pos1766"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> He was found guilty of actually murdering those people, so the probability or possibility of those people being killed in some other way is now an academic issue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1767"><a name="pos1767"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUBONI:</span> I agree with that.  The point I am trying to highlight as such is ....(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1768"><a name="pos1768"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> You must work on the basis that he did the shooting or any of his group, although he denies that any of his friends had a gun.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1769"><a name="pos1769"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUBONI:</span> In my view, when he shot, he just shot indiscriminately.  So therefore the probability is there that six bullets could infiltrate the deceased and it is possible that also the children could be shot the way he was shot.  Therefore, I am saying, in my view he has made a full disclosure in that regard because he stated that when he arrived there he started to shoot all over the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1770"><a name="pos1770"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> He denies that he could have foreseen that there would be women and children in the house.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1775"><a name="pos1775"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUBONI:</span> From what I heard from him certainly he denies that he foresaw that there might have been people inside the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1776"><a name="pos1776"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> ... in a four-roomed house round about daybreak an ordinary house in the rural area, occupied by people, there wouldn't be women and children in the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1777"><a name="pos1777"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUBONI:</span> If you look at the time, if you look at the judgment it was round about 6 am and it is in March.  Maybe by that time it is still dawn so to say and there are some huts and other houses in the yard.  Anything was possible.  The other possibility is that they are still in the other houses.  The other possibility is that they were there, but in their view they were chasing those people who had got into that house.  They believed whom they were chasing were in that house.  It must also be taken into account that the situation was tense in the area.  There was tension in the area.  So there was no time really to think about the fact that maybe there must be children there in this house, there must be innocent women in this house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1778"><a name="pos1778"></a>	As the judgment stands today there are some references to the evidence of the children.  I submit that maybe it is very important to if the version of the applicant is weighed against he version of the children, it must be taken into account that when the incident took place they were still very young and it a known fact that with young children they have got a tendency to imagine things that they never took place.  For that reason I submit that the version of the applicant, when he says they got out of the house and he was still having his gun, and when he asked the kids about the</p>

<p class="line" id="line1781"><a name="pos1781"></a>people who were shooting they just looked at him.  Then I submit that must be accepted as being probable. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1782"><a name="pos1782"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Why?  These two children, one of them had just been shot.  Their grandmother had been shot in their presence.  The other woman was dead in the house.  You are suggesting it is probable that they would have gone out and spoken to this man who had just done the shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1783"><a name="pos1783"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUBONI:</span> The evidence is that after the shooting had stopped, then the children got out of the house.  If they got out of the house, anything is possible there.  They could have got out of the house simply because they thought the assailants had gone out.  Maybe they were going out to ask for some assistance and when they saw these people who were having these guns and when they asked them the questions, surely that is why they did not respond.  Because I think it was still ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1784"><a name="pos1784"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> But wouldn't they ask assistance from the three people in the house, the people who fled into the house, Zulu and Skwayi, rather than go out and ask assistance from the persons standing outside shooting into the house?  If those other people were in the house at all?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1794"><a name="pos1794"></a><span class="speaker">MR KUBONI:</span> In my view it is.  In the sense that the area by this time was divided into the IFP supporting members and the ANC supporting members.  In the house, they just shot, and when they shot in fact their objective was to ensure that they eliminate those people whom they regarded as IFP supporters.   (CHANGE OVER TO TAPE 3B)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1795"><a name="pos1795"></a>	Ms Thabethe has raised the question of the causal link between the attack and the political objective.  In my view the applicant, when he shot at these people, he was mostly concerned with eliminating the IFP members who were inside there.   The people who got shot were caught whilst they were going on with their mission of ensuring that the people they were pursuing had been eliminated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1796"><a name="pos1796"></a>	I submit that the applicant has made a full disclosure of what took place and sometimes it is very difficult to remember each and everything because this incident took place as far back as 1992.  That's all I would like to submit at this stage. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1797"><a name="pos1797"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Ms Thabethe, is there anything you wish to say in response to the argument advanced?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1798"><a name="pos1798"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Yes, Chairperson, I would like to clarify one thing on the causal connection between the commission of the act and the political objectivity.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1801"><a name="pos1801"></a>We are talking here about the relationship between the shootings on two females and two children.  That is the relationship between that commission of the act and the objectivity pursued.  What I was saying is, there doesn't seem to be proportionality between the act that was committed and the objective that was perused.  I don't see how we can say then the requirements of the Act were met. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1802"><a name="pos1802"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> (Inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1803"><a name="pos1803"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> I would say if the political objective was to kill the IFP members for what they had done at the Luthuli house, but in turn two females and two children were killed, and the applicant ... that there were innocent women and children in the house.  I don't see how it justifies the political objective.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1804"><a name="pos1804"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> But couldn't their objective have been there is a war and we kill everybody related to the IFP, whether women, children or adult males?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1805"><a name="pos1805"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> From the applicant's evidence I don't think that's what he said.  He didn't say their aim was to kill everybody.  They wanted to kill these two people and they didn't know that there were women and children in the house.  If he had said that then maybe I would say something else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1806"><a name="pos1806"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> What do you say about the fact that a house belonging to ANC people was burned down, that is the Luthuli's house.  There had been other raids on ANC supporters and so on, and he and his friends decided that they must defend themselves and one of the ways in which they thought they would defend themselves would be to shoot and kill the perpetrators.  Whether they succeeded or not is another matter.  But the decision to shoot and kill those who have been harassing and injuring and killing their kind,</p>

<p class="line" id="line1809"><a name="pos1809"></a>is that a political objective?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1810"><a name="pos1810"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> I would say it is a political objective, giving the setting at that place he is talking about, Bamshela, where there was unrest between ANC and IFP and people took it upon themselves to defend themselves.  I would say in that context there is political objectivity.  But my problem is whether it was pursued as they had planned to and they had aimed to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1811"><a name="pos1811"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> The offence was aimed at people whom they regarded as Inkatha.  Unfortunately the wrong people got killed, but the aim and the objective was to attack Inkatha. MS THABETHE:  I would say the objective is political  but the relationship between the act that was committed and the political objectivity, I am not sure about that one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1812"><a name="pos1812"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> I have a problem which has suddenly come to me.  Perhaps you can assist me.  Is there any evidence, any reference in the judgment to the fact that these three men they said they were chasing came to the house or not?  I can find no such reference.  I don't know if the question was ever raised.  I don't know if it was raised at the trial.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1813"><a name="pos1813"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> In the judgment it says they went via the Zulu kraal - or let me start</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1814"><a name="pos1814"></a>"They then set off in pursuit of these men.  We ran went to find them.  They went via the Zulu kraal to the Nqobo kraal".</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1815"><a name="pos1815"></a>Sorry, I thought that "they" was referring to the other men.  Seemingly it refers to the applicant and the other people. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1816"><a name="pos1816"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> And also, if you look at the judgment page 2, dealing with Peter's evidence, second paragraph</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1817"><a name="pos1817"></a>"He testified they were busy making a fire in his house when they heard shots from outside.  When</blockquote>

<blockquote class="line" id="line1820"><a name="pos1820"></a>they went out they heard the shots coming closer to their house".</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1821"><a name="pos1821"></a>Page 3:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1822"><a name="pos1822"></a>"Pakamile Nqobo says she heard shots in the direction of the Zulu kraal".</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1823"><a name="pos1823"></a>That would support the idea that there were groups coming towards the Nqobo kraal from further away via the Zulu kraal who were firing shots. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1824"><a name="pos1824"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> It would suggest that they were coming from wherever they were coming from, coming towards the Nqobo kraal where the incident actually happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1825"><a name="pos1825"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> ... little boy came out because he would have gone and spoken to his brother.  But now I am beginning to wonder, was his brother perhaps in the house.   I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1826"><a name="pos1826"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> I don't know, but my opinion would be that if they were chasing the people and they could see where they were going, I would assume that they went to the Nqobo kraal because they saw them, they were chasing them and they went there because they saw them going in there.  I don't know if it can be assumed that they went to the Nqobo kraal because they saw these two people that they were chasing go into the Nqobo kraal.  That would be my assumption.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1827"><a name="pos1827"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> And the trial Judge did not, it appears, which I hadn't had full regard to before, convict on the basis that he believed the evidence of Peter that the applicant fired shots from the doorway.  He convicted the applicant on the basis of common purpose.   Can we now reject the applicant's evidence as to how he fired the shots and say Peter's evidence must be preferred, that he was in the room, he wasn't firing blindly through the window?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1830"><a name="pos1830"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> I am not sure if it would make any difference whether he was firing inside the house or outside the house.  The fact is he fired and people were shot.  And as to the question of whether they went inside the house, I think that is what we can never know, maybe we can assume, it is probable that they went inside the kraal that is in the yard.  But we are not sure because there were so many houses, if maybe they went into the house that the applicant thought they were going into.  I think that's what is not clear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1831"><a name="pos1831"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> If they merely fired thinking they were firing at the people they had been pursuing and by chance they hit these other people, isn't that an act with a political objective?  If they fired thinking they were firing at the IFP enemy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1832"><a name="pos1832"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> That's what the applicant says.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1833"><a name="pos1833"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Yes,  but I was suggesting to him when I was questioning him on the bullets and the injuries that it can't be true that he merely fired blindly.  He must have been aware of what he was firing at.  Once one can find that he was aware of that, or that he is not being frank with the Committee on that, then one rejects the application.  But is that a valid conclusion, in the light of what I put to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1834"><a name="pos1834"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Actually I think it is.  If he had in foreseeing, and his political objective was to kill the IFP that were inside, yes, then maybe such a political objectivity.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1835"><a name="pos1835"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> ... if he stood in the doorway without going into the house and he could see the people in the room, he could see there were women and children and he opened fire on them, that would be the end of any political objective,</p>

<p class="line" id="line1838"><a name="pos1838"></a>isn't that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1839"><a name="pos1839"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Yes, it would.  On the other hand, if he says he stood outside because there were shots coming inside and then he shot because he was supposedly shooting at the people who were shooting at him, then I am not sure if it doesn't discard political objectivity.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1840"><a name="pos1840"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> At least, in his favour it can be said that there is no evidence to contradict his version that there were people who did fire from within the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1841"><a name="pos1841"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Unfortunately there isn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1842"><a name="pos1842"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> We don't know if such evidence was led at the trial.  All we have before us is the judgment.  It may be that there was such evidence.</p>
