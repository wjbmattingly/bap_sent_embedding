            "Mr Chairman, at the outset I would like to apologise for the lateness of the start of this inquiry,\nthe reason being that the next of kin and victims were apparently delayed by reason of the roads being extremely wet, and they come from a fairly remote area.  \nI'd like to thank my learned friend, Mr du Toit, his junior and his attorney for the considerable assistance given in the preparation of the record in this matter, which has saved the somewhat understaffed staff of your Committee considerable work, and of course time and money, and I appreciate their assistance in this regard.\nMr Chairman, Members of the Committee, as you know the applicant makes application for amnesty in respect of 11 counts of murder for which he was convicted and sentenced in the Pietermaritzburg Supreme Court in April 1992.  He is also asking for amnesty in respect of two attempted murders, and also for the crime of arson, in respect of which crime he was not charged.  \nAll these events took place - all these events occurred on the night of the 2nd/3rd December 1988 in a place known as Trust Feed in the district of New Hanover, at a time when the applicant was the station commander of the New Hanover Police Station, and the events have since been stigmatised as the Trust Feed Massacre.\nIf I can refer you, Mr Chairman, Members of the Committee, to Volume I, page 8, of the application.  You will see under the list of names of those deceased appear two persons, Ida Hadebe and Numbagoli Zulu, who were the complainants in the attempted murder charge.  All these people have been notified, and indeed I have called the roll.  They, together with those appearing on page 9 of \n\t/Volume I\nVolume I - you'll see those are other interested parties -have been notified.  I should indicate that the name of\nthe deceased, B R Makhatini - that's at No 71 on that page, page 9 - he has since died, but his family were advised.  The police sent me a fax indicating that they were all advised of the hearing today, and they indeed signed an acknowledgement in respect of the advice given to them.  In regard to the witness No 89, or the next of kin rather, on page 9 - that's No 89 - this person is also dead, but his family have been informed.  In regard to No 86, that is a duplication of No 54 on that page, Mr Chairman, Members of the Committee.  In regard to the witness No 87, that is a duplication of No 56, and in regard to the witness No 88, that is a duplication of No 55.  I understand from the briefers from the Rehabilitation and Reparations Committee that the witness, Ntombolo Rose Makhatini had not arrived this morning.  Joseph Makhatini had not, and Hlupegile Peregrine Xulu likewise had not, but they might be arriving at a later stage, and I can ascertain that during the short adjournment.\nNow, just to put the Committee in the picture regarding the settlement known as Trust Feed, I should refer you to the judgment of the Trial Court, which appears in Volume II at page 383 the following, and I just paraphrase what the Trial Court found.  I don't intend to be long, but it was established during the course of the trial that the Trust Feed area was a so-called black area, and a number of black people bought land in that area in the early part of this century.  It was intended they would farm it, but nonetheless they rented the land owned \n\t/by them\nby them out to tenants.  At a later stage the tenants began to assert what they considered to be their rights,\nand they formed a Crisis Committee.  In short the bulk of the landowners at a much later stage sought the assistance of the Inkatha Freedom Party, and the bulk of the tenants forming the Crisis Committee sought the aid of the United Democratic Front, and that caused a certain amount of difficulty.  But nonetheless at the time when the events with which you are concerned took place Trust Feed was a -to quote the Trial Judge - a haven of peace.\nAnd in conclusion, in regard to the opening remarks, Mr Chairman, Members of the Committee, I wish to say that despite a strong recommendation by the Trial Judge - and this appears in Volume III at page 631 and following pages - that there be a full inquiry by the police relating to what appeared to be a cover up in the initial investigations of the murders and attempted murders, no such inquiry has ever taken place.  There were undertakings by the then Minister of Law and Order that such would take place, but nothing has been done.  \nI received a telefax from a senior member of the South African Police Services the other day, who indicated that a captain who was accused No 1 at the trial, and who was acquitted, was subsequently promoted to the rank of major;  that Superintendent, as he is now, van den Heever, who was accused No 1 at the trial, has now been promoted to that rank;  and on the instructions of the Commissioner-General, that is Commissioner van der Merwe -the then Commissioner-General - Lieutenant General Basie Smit and a retired Regional Court Magistrate, a Mr Krugel, had consultations with the Attorney-General in this \n\t/province,\nprovince, and following that no departmental steps were taken against Superintendent van den Heever.  This matter\nis now with the Investigative Unit, who have issued a subpoena on Lieutenant-General, as he then was, Basie Smit.\nThat concludes my opening remarks, Mr Chairman.",

Mr Brink, with regard to the, as it were, return of service that you have there, I understood you to say that the report says that the police informed the interested parties that there would be this hearing today.  There is something that is deeply troubling me about this whole business, and that is that that is not what the Act says people must be told.  The Act does not say that the people should just be told about the date of the hearing.  The Act wants the families of the victims to be informed of much more than that.  In faction section 19 (4) says that the - that in a prescribed manner the victims or persons, etcetera, having interest in the application must be told when - the time when the application will be heard and considered, and then these people must be informed of their right to be present at the hearing and to testify, adduce evidence, and submit any article to be taken into consideration.  In other words the real purpose of this is that people must be appraised of their rights, not just to come and make a cosmetic appearance before us, or at the ...

There are very few - in Trust Feeds there are no postal addresses.  It was as a result of the assistance I received from a member of the Attorney-General's staff that I contacted a Superintendent Marion, who was involved in the investigation at a later stage in the trial.  Superintendent Marion knows all these people, and he gave them notice of the venue and the date for hearing.  These people were to have been here at 9 o'clock this morning.  I personally spoke to Mr Mbongwe, who is an educated man,\n\t/he is a\nhe is a schoolteacher, who is the victim in the arson matter.

The State Attorney came this morning.  I understand that, bar one matter, all have been settled, and indeed were settled some time ago.  In regard to the question of settlements I have asked Mr Kajee to indicate - he does represent them and he is here present - to put himself on record, and to address you in regard to those settlements.",

The community of Trust Feeds has also requested me to advise the Amnesty Committee that they will try to forgive Mr Brian Mitchell if he becomes actively involved in the reconstruction of the community that he was responsible for destroying.\nThe application itself is not being opposed, it is merely left to the discretion of the Amnesty Committee.

            "Thank you, Mr Chairperson.  I intend briefly introducing the evidence which I seek to lead in support of the application, but I must first thank my learned colleague, Mr Kajee, for placing on record that there is no opposition.  I must also extend my thanks on behalf of the applicant that the community is willing to receive him in their midst, because he has informed me that it is his intention to visit the community at an arranged date to offer his personal apologies.  And we are grateful therefore that the application is not opposed by those who \t/have been,\nhave been, as my colleague indicated, so tragically affected by what happened.\nThe application will show that my client joined the South African Police Force when he was 18 years of age in December of 1975.  Certain personal matters will be covered briefly by verbal evidence, since it is before you and your fellow Commissioners in the lengthy affidavit which was placed before you.  \nThe evidence will show that my client was not involved in what one would call normal policing at all.  In fact he spent only a short period of his rather lengthy career doing normal policing, and I can tell you that in respect of that I have received letters from members of the community, unsolicited, expressing gratitude for what he did.  The evidence will show that my client, almost immediately after he completed his training, was involved in riot control.  When he was not involved in the control of riots and political strife, political problems, he was in the then South West Africa, where he fought SWAPO.  I must also say that it is an outstanding feature of his service that so little time was spent on what one would normally describe as policing in a normal society.\nSo it happened then that in roughly February of 1987 he became involved in what is called - or what is known as the Joint Management System.  He was made a staff officer and attached to the Divisional Headquarters in Pietermaritzburg.  There he became the secretary of the Regional Joint Management Committee, and evidence will be led to explain what this was and what its main function was.  In his capacity as secretary of the system he came in possession of certain documents, inter alia a strategy \n\t/document\ndocument compiled by a general of the South African Police headquarters in Pretoria, setting out the police involvement and implementation in what was called the total strategy against what was seen as the total onslaught.\nMr Chairperson, Commissioners, the evidence will show, and the document itself will show, that there was devised a Government management philosophy, or a strategy, which covered most aspects of life.  It covered, for example, the church domain, education, media, the so-called alternative media, and in fact dealt, as I have said, with almost every terrain or domain of life itself.\nMore particularly of relevant to my client, however, is the strategy which is set out in this particular document to the effect that people will be taken from the black communities, trained as so-called special constables, or \"kits konstabels,\" and will then be taken back into the communities to win back physically land areas lost to the UDF/ANC or the Comrades, as they are called.  The strategy is to claim back inch by inch land or areas already lost, and to prevent further gains on the side of the UDF/ANC combination active at that point in time.\nThe documents which have been placed before you already by my client will show that at first a small number of special constables were employed and trained, and, because of what is described as the success they experienced in winning back inch by inch certain of the areas now dominated by the UDF, at some stage in '87 and also in the beginning of 1988 roughly 16 000 special constables were added to the police force consisting of \n/48 000.\n48 000.  This force was considered to be an auxiliary force, and it was born out of the then Rhodesia.  The force of special constables were deployed throughout the country as a result of the strategy set out in this particular document, annexure A to the affidavit of my client, the applicant.  In this process of deployment the special constables were taken all over the country and attached mainly to Riot Units.  The Riot Units used the special constables in order to regain area, land lost to the UDF, and/or to prevent further claims made successfully by the UDF.\nA research document of the Catholic Institute for International Relations, which we have attached to the application, and to which I will refer my client so that he can confirm the contents thereof as also how he saw it, shows that on the 1st of March of 1988 300 special constables were deployed in the Pietermaritzburg area.  The then Minister of Law and Order announced that the special constables will be deployed in Pietermaritzburg to restore law and order within the Pietermaritzburg divisional area, and probably also the KwaZulu-Natal or Natal area.  Despite church protestations, protestations from the church, the constables were deployed and the Defence Force elements or Defence Force members were removed from the area.  The document is of a view that this was done in order to deploy the special constables successfully.\nMy client, in his capacity as secretary of a Joint Management Centre, divisionally seen within the headquarters of Pietermaritzburg Police, also came into possession of certain documentation which was handed to \n\t/students\nstudents at a police training centre called Milierskop(?).  The lectures were available at the headquarters to Riot Unit members, more senior people, in the form of a manual.  The manual, and one of the lectures more particularly, deals with the clandestine operations of the South African Police secretly operating in small black townships.  It is, of course, needless to say that this is highly relevant to the application which was placed before you.  \tThe evidence will therefore show that there was an approach within the South African Police Force that not an inch will be lost, and that inches lost will be regained, and when my client took up position as station commander of the New Hanover police district he in fact became the ex officio chairperson of the local or mini Joint Management Centre, and it was his duty, as it was the duty of station commanders all over the country, to implement this strategy which I have summarised briefly.\nThe judgment of His Lordship, Mr Justice Wilson, showed that the motive behind his conduct in Trust Feed in fact was to interfere with the political dispensation, to interfere with political gains made by a UDF aligned organisation, and it is quite clear that my client, on the instructions of a superior officer, Captain Terblanche, the local officer commanding of the Riot Unit, called Riot Unit 8, caused specials to be delivered to the Trust Feed area, where, in line with the manual, they arrived in an unmarked kombi and in civilian clothing after dark.  And, as the judgment clearly shows, the special constables were used in an attack that evening.  \nThe Riot Unit operated in some instances, as it did \nhere, as a sweeping instrument.  In other words it would \n\t/move into\nmove into an area, mostly UDF dominated, and it would then sweep the area of the young Comrades of weapons in order to prepare the area for an attack, which would then take place later during the evening.  This attack would be launched by Inkatha or Inkatha Youth Brigade, as it also happened here, and there would be support from special constables.\nThe special constables were used, as the strategy document also sets out, as a physical wedge against what was called the tyranny of the Comrades, the idea being that the policing will acquire a black face, as is also clearly demonstrated in this research document which we traced, and that it would be possible for the black policemen to act offensively within certain smaller areas on a clandestine basis.   \nThe evidence will show, therefore, that my client's conduct was a politically motivated, that it was as a result of what he knew, and the instructions were orders of a Major - Captain, later Major Terblanche.  It is necessary to state that the evidence will show that Major Terblanche was, some time after the event, killed by a special constable.  The special constable in his turn was killed by members of the Murder and Robbery Squad.  My client's information, which he will briefly refer to, is that that was done in order to prevent the relevant special constable, that is the person who killed Major Terblanche, to reveal that other such attacks in which the special constables were used took place in the Hammarsdale area and various other areas within the Natal territory.\nMr Chairperson ...

            "Thank you, Mr Chairperson, Vice-Chairperson, Commissioners and members of the audience.  The application is brought under the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act of 1995.  I think it is necessary - I think that it is necessary to state first of all that one finds in the introduction to this Act certain aims set out;  to build a bridge between a divided society, to establish the truth in order to prevent a repetition of such acts.  That would be acts of gross violation of human rights.  And it says that the well-being of all South African citizens and peace would require reconciliation and the reconstruction of a society, and it is in order to advance this reconciliation and reconstruction, according to the Act itself, that amnesty shall be granted in respect of acts and offences associated with political objectives committed in the course of the conflicts of the past.\nIt is important to note that the Constitution provides that amnesty shall be provided or granted in respect of offences or acts associated with a political objective and committed in the course of the conflicts of the past.  It is of course necessary that there should be a political objective, and the motive of the person who committed the offences is also the first consideration to be considered in section 20 (3) of the relevant Act.  \nI would submit that in this particular matter there is no doubt that there is a political objective.  The motive was not personal.  And I would submit that that is quite clear from the facts, not only before the Committee, but also the facts placed before the Trial Court.  \tSecondly, the context in which the act or the\n\t/offences\noffences were committed, and whether it was committed in the course of political uprising, a disturbance, or an event, or in reaction thereto.  We would submit that it is clear on the facts that what happened was part of the events in that particular time and in the area of Natal, and that there is in fact also a satisfaction of the second requirement, which is the context.\nThirdly there is the consideration of the legal and factual nature of the act or the offence, including the gravity - the gravity of such act.  It is of course obvious that the offences here are very serious indeed.  Were that the only consideration the application probably would not have been placed before you, but it is one of the considerations and it must be weighed as against the other considerations.\nFourthly, the question as to whether the object or objective of the Act was primarily directed at a political opponent or against private property or individuals.  It is significant that the section does not refer to the victim itself, but the aim, the primary aim of the act.  In this instance the primary aim of the act, of the offences, certainly was directed at political opponents as seen from the point of view of my client, and we would submit that the requirement that there should be primary direction at a political opponent has in fact been satisfied on the facts before you.\nIt was done in the execution of an order.  He was instructed by Major Terblanche to receive the special constables and place them at the house of the Gabela.  He was instructed to see to it that the violence is stopped, and I would submit that it is quite clear on the facts\n\t/before\nbefore you that there was the execution of an order.\nLastly, the relationship between the acts and the political objective pursued, the directness, the proximity of the relationship, the proportionality of the acts or offences to the objective pursued.  We would certainly submit that on the facts there is the political objective, and that there is also a direct proximity in what was done.  The specials were taken there in order to achieve the political objective which was sought by my client.\nWe would therefore submit that on the facts before you the criteria have been met.\nWhat also has to be considered is whether the requirements mentioned in subsection (2) are met.  Firstly, my client was an employee of the Security Force, he was a member of a Security Force, and I would submit that on the facts he clearly acted within the scope of his express or implied authority as a result of an order, and that it was directed against a known political organisation.  It was also committed with the object of countering or otherwise resisting the struggle.\nAt worst for my client I would submit, Mr Chairperson and Members, he satisfies the requirements mentioned in subparagraph (f) of subsection (2) of section 20, that he on reasonable grounds believed that he was acting in the course and scope of his duties, and within the scope of his express or implied authority.  \nThe background information placed before you was placed before you in order to show what went on in his mind, what his state of mind was like at that point in time;  to show what facts he knew and what facts he took into account when he acted.  At worst for him the factual\n\t/basis is\nbasis is such that there are reasonable grounds for the applicant to believe that he was acting within the course and scope of his duties.  There is no evidence that there  was a personal motive.  It is clear that the motive was a political motive.\nIt is not necessary for my client to show that the official policy was the use of the special constables in the way in which he used the special constables, but what is clear is that there was the frame of mind that not a single inch of land will be lost to what was perceived to be enemy or the opponent.  The strategy was that the special constables should be a physical wedge against the Comrades.  His perception, at worst for him, was that the special constables were there to prevent further land from being dominated or won over by the UDF/ANC Comrades.\nAgain it is not offered as justification for what was done, because it cannot be justified.  It is not offered in order to show that there is innocence, because the Court has already found that there is guilt.  It is offered to show that from the age of 18 there was this culture, one can describe it as a subculture, as Professor Grazer in fact has done.  There developed a culture which is foreign to a democratic and open society.  There developed a subculture within the police force which was unhealthy, which was abnormal, and which brought about a situation where people were indoctrinated, where people saw other citizens as enemies.  And we see that from the open way in which the evidence was placed before you, and we see that even in the strategy document that there is a reference to enemy.  And the friction in the past, the difference of views, brought about an approach within the\n\t/police\npolice force in the circles in which my client moved that certain citizens were to be regarded as enemies, not only of the police but of the State.  And I think that what was demonstrated by the evidence today is that a peaceful co-existence became impossible;  that the police, in Natal at least, chose sides;  that in Natal the police force was strengthened by the addition of certain special constables, at least some of whom had definite links with Inkatha.  Of course they should have remained neutral.  Of course they should have been involved in normal policing, but my client did not have the privilege of working in a normal society.  My client was used to quell disruptive action.  My client was used by the police force to quell and limit rioting.  He was certainly not privileged to serve as a community policeman.",

            "I think that the strategy document there makes it clear that the idea is to use black people within the black community, tragic as this may be, as a physical wedge.  The strategy was exactly to remove the white police face from the community, as I understand the strategy, and as my - I think my client understood it at that point in time, so that he saw the special constables as this wedge, this physical force which will be used in\n\t/order to\norder to prevent further land from becoming UDF or ANC dominated.  And it is on that basis that he approached it. I think that there was the added advantage, as my learned junior points out, that such violence as will come to the fore will be black on black and not white policemen on black.  I think that is also clear from the approach which is found in this strategy document.\nWhat needs to be pointed out is that within this subculture, within this subculture of, one can say, a civil war in this area during those years, the foundations of the police force were shattered, as my client testified.  The moral foundations of the police force were shattered, and what my client has been testifying about, for example, the sweeping of an area in order to render it vulnerable, is not something which was heard here only.  A day or two ago in the Supreme Court in Pietermaritzburg another special constable testified to exactly the same effect, namely that areas - according to a newspaper report that I read - would be used - their unit would be used to sweep the area and to ready the area for certain overt action.  Also from the one document it is clear that clandestine operations took place, that strange or foreign policemen - that is to that particular area - would be brought in to operate secretly within that area.\nIt is within that framework that one does observe certain overt moments, certain overt elements in the covert plan.  On this factual basis one cannot approach what was done from the armchair and from the viewpoint of a normal police force operating within a normal society, because both those two elements were missing at that point in time.\n/MR DE JAGER",

It was only some years after that - I must also point out that - and I think WILSON J will remember this, the special constables were allowed to leave with a group of 80 from the South African Police Force and went en masse after this incident to the KwaZulu Police, where the four specials were hidden.  They went to a kraal where they were looking after somebody.

But I think the subsequent events also demonstrate that there was the stamp of approval.\nBut let me say immediately that if one looks at the criteria there is no stamp of approval necessary.  Major Terblanche sent the constables there and instructed him to place them at Gabela's because they were going to be used.  My client received an instruction, and what happened afterwards in my view, at worst for my client, tends to confirm that this situation was not totally unacceptable to the authorities at that point in time.  Knowing this, \n\t/because\nbecause the senior officer from the head office, the\nbrigadier, knew about it.  Knowing that my client was promoted to captain in 1991.  It is therefore clear that what happened was not even held against him on the basis that there should not be promotion.\nI must also point out that the promotion did not follow the event, so that I don't think one can argue that, objectively seen, there was a seeking of a more senior position, and that he was, let us say, rewarded for what happened.  That certainly is not the position, no.",

            "What happened in my view was that before the trial - when you mean did it come out you mean into the open, the public, or do you mean was it mentioned to somebody else?  If you mean by coming out in the open, at the trial already when this was canvassed for the first time Major Terblanche was deceased.  So he was deceased because, as I said, he was killed by another special constable who was himself killed by other policemen.  So that in fact when there was the first opportunity for this to be made public he was already deceased.\nBut the discussion at the particular time, that is when the brigadier came to Pietermaritzburg, as I understand the position - to New Hanover, when they discussed the matter with my client, Terblanche was also present.  I think it was quite clear that his presence must have influenced the brigadier from head office, who just did nothing and allowed van Zyl, after a private \n\t/discussion,\ndiscussion, to go back to my client and say, \"Don't worry,\nnothing will happen.\"\nBut I must point out that it is not necessary for a successful application to show that there was a stamp of approval from the authorities.  That there was an instruction is enough, but I would suggest that on the probabilities, if one looks both at what happened at the time, what happened prior to the incident, and also what happened after the incident, even when the Trial Judge said, \"But there should be an investigation into this.  What is this Joint Management System?\"  WILSON J said, \"How could policemen be involved in this?  This is not normal police function.\"  He said, \"Could it be that this unit was used elsewhere?\"  He posed various questions and he said, \"Let there be an inquiry.\"  If there was any concern on the side of the authorities at that point in time to establish, to answer those very apposite questions, there would have been an inquiry.  I would suggest that the fact that there was no inquiry also tends to support that there was the stamp of approval, although, as I have indicated, that is not what the Act requires.   Even if the applicant, given what he knew, was reasonably - on reasonable grounds believed that he was acting within the course and scope, or express or implied authority, it would be adequate.\nThe background material was made available for two reasons.  Firstly to give a graphic description of what the typical reading material in this abnormal society was for a policeman.  In what normal society would a policeman be reading a strategy document and counter measures like that?  The answer is very obvious.  In no normal society.  \t/And that\nAnd that is why I say that one - and I think my client has\nalso lodged his plea with you to put you back not only to those years, but also if possible into his shoes from 18 years onwards on the one side, and that is what happened.  It is tragic that there were sides, and that the normal function of a police force to remain neutral was not adhered to.  What one found was the police force in general solidly on the one side, because the other side was perceived not only to be anti-Government, anti-State, but in fact the enemy.  And it is in an almost war-like situation that the police were pulled in and then used, in my view, to do certain things.  Because what is clear is that the Joint Management System should not have been something in which the police force and my client should ever have been involved in, but they were used in order to limit UDF domination, the internal ground swell which was unstoppable probably already at that point in time.",

So, at worst for my client, if the target was not that specified in the order it will make no difference, because in accordance with the criteria as set out in the Act he will remain entitled to the amnesty.\n\t/It does\nIt does not say that the victim or the object should be a political opponent, but that it should be primarily directed at a political opponent or State property or person, or against, whether it was primarily directed at the political opponent or private property or individual.\nI therefore believe, with respect, Mr Commissioner, that the question as to whether the target is in conformity with the actual order will not arise.  My client sought the achievement of a political objective, and that is what both the Constitution and this Act have in mind, namely to, even under unthinkable circumstances like this, women and children killed, to accept that in the abnormal situation horrendous offences were committed, and that provided that the aim or the objective was political that there should be an approach which is alien to the criminal justice system, namely to release or to prevent the criminal justice system from coming into operation by bringing about early release.",

            "No, that - I think that follows from what I say, namely that what is the main object of examination here is the motive which sits behind the act.  The consequences, unthinkably tragic as they may be, will not affect that motive.  And it is for that reason why the Legislature has been very careful not to limit the granting of amnesty to those - to be blunt, to those  murderers, the murderers of exactly the people at which the Act was also aimed at motive-wise by the perpetrator.  That is why the - the requirement is one of association.  The requirement is one of making the object, the primary object even - there may be secondary objectives, but the\n\t/primary\nprimary objective to achieve a political aim.\nYou are also called upon to keep in mind the criteria applied in the two Acts repealed by section 48 of this Act.  Of course the first Act would not be applicable because he was not entitled to consideration under the first Act, but the '92 Act the criteria there will be applicable.  And there the wider criterion is clearly associated with a political motive.  \nI must point out that it is here where the release of the other four perpetrators of the offence found guilty by WILSON J will become relevant, because the four special constables, who were not only convicted of a similar offence, but the exact same offence or offences, were released under that Act.  And I would submit that that is also a consideration which should weigh heavily with you since, in my view, the Constitution could never have envisaged inequality, in that the four special constables are released and that the officer who gave that instruction is not released.  I would submit that one is driven to an inference of inequality if people who committed the identical offence are, for purposes of amnesty, not treated equally.  And therefore I think in this particular matter the criteria applied in the Act of 1992 will be of specific weight.\nThere are other considerations not directly applicable to the facts.  One of these considerations must be the effect or the outcome of this application.  If you were to grant amnesty or early release here it will send out a strong signal to other members in the police force, in the defence force, past and present, to come forward and to tell everything.  I think that an early decision\n\t/here, a\nhere, a speedy decision to release, will bring about a  situation where other force members, as my client has in fact urged them to do, will come forward and will lodge their applications.  I think that it is necessary that those who have more information than my client should come forward.  I would mention members of the force who may have been involved with the Management System and various other strategies for much longer than my client would have been would also possess valuable information.  If you were to grant the application of my client there will be a solid signal which is sent out. \nThat also would be in accordance with the declared aim of this Act, because, as, Mr Chairperson and Commissioners, you will no doubt know, the aim to establish the truth to prevent a repetition of such acts in future is almost at the heart of this Act.

            "Mr Chairman, Members of the Committee, the case that is made out on behalf of the applicant is that the Brian Mitchell of the Trust Feed massacre was a Brian Mitchell steeped in the indoctrination of the apartheid system.  He was at that time shrouded in a cocoon of ignorance, largely encouraged, fostered and nurtured by the system of apartheid, which curtained him off from any meaningful communication with his fellow human beings, with the black people whom he saw as nothing more than the swart kaffir.\n\t/The case\nThe case is also made out that during his incarceration Brian Mitchell has had the time to reflect.  He has had the time to actively educate himself, and he has had contact with various people, with various pastors, who have brought him out of that ignorant level at which he was operating.  And this will be seen from the input of Pastor Ray McCauley and Reverend Jaba.\nWhat we say is that the Brian Mitchell before you has undergone a transformation.  From the facts it will emerge that he has come to a greater understanding of himself and of his deeds.  Brian Mitchell comes before you today and says that he wants to go out there and he wants to be actively involved in freeing others from the shackles of their indoctrination, those who are still shackled to the old South Africa by the chains of ignorance and indoctrination.  And this he wants to do by being involved in preaching, and through his future conduct and involvement in the community.\nNow, going to the objectives of the Act, Brian Mitchell has told you that he wants to make amends.  Further objectives of the Act is that he has come here and made a full disclosure with a view to reconciliation.  Now, his disclosure before in this application has at a micro level resulted in a certain measure of relief being given to the immediate victims, in that there has been a settlement of their civil claims arising out of his co-operation and the facts which he has made available to the attorneys of the victims.  \nAt a wider level, on a macro level as it were, the disclosures here will no doubt lead to the emergence of disclosures of new facts, and a new perspective or better\n\t/understanding\nunderstanding of the identity of the real perpetrators of various crimes and atrocities perpetrated throughout the country, as well as the methods used in achieving their aims.  The strategy employed at the Trust Feed was employed throughout the country.  The information which he places before this Committee, if properly used, will no doubt result in other persons in positions similar to that of Brian Mitchell coming forward.\nDuring the repressive era, or at least a portion of it in the 80s and the early 90s, I was personally involved in conducting various defences on behalf of activists.  I had done dozens of trials for certain Comrades and for persons who were in fact the victims and targets of the strategy advanced by the likes of the applicant.  This added to my awareness of the destructive and dehumanizing dispensation of the past, the destructive and dehumanizing policy of apartheid.  It destroyed many lives, it destroyed many families, and destroyed much good and many good human beings.\nThe Interim Constitution and the Act with which we are concerned here today, the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act, both have certain objectives, and these objectives look to the past, they look to the present, and they look to the future.  In looking to the past they require and they urge, they exhort disclosure of what happened, and this is best done by confessions and disclosures by the perpetrators of the violence in the past.  At the same time it looks to the present in that there is the coming together of the victims and the perpetrators.  The additional information and disclosures provided by the perpetrators makes it possible for\n\t/reparation\nreparation for the victims, and this would then lead to some measure of reconciliation.\nThe Act also, in its preamble, looks to the recommendations being made from the information gleaned out of the past so that necessary measures may be instituted to ensure that this never happens again.  In this context then it is necessary for persons like the applicant to come forward and to reveal, to explain how and why they acted as they did.  The knowledge gleaned from these disclosures will help achieve the objectives of the Constitution and of the Act.  The history which is then put together may be used as a factual plinth on which a reconciled new South Africa may be placed.\nThe releasing of an individual like Brian Mitchell would normally be anathema to me.  It would be repugnable in the extreme to any - in any normal society because it strikes at the very heart of the criminal justice system.  But we have an Act here, and we have an abnormal situation which calls on us of necessity to suspend even what is at the heart of the criminal justice system, and we are to achieve the greater goals of the Constitution and the Act for the reconciliation of the nation.\nIn conclusion, the granting of amnesty in this particular case will be single(?) in various respect, and also unique.  It would be a grant of amnesty to the first senior officer from the police who has come forward.  He has made full disclosure, and I would submit that he has satisfied the various criteria.  What is also important in granting amnesty is this individual comes before you as a person who has been transformed.",

One reason it sounds like a prayer is because I have stated that it is anathema for me to stand here.  I find it repugnable to stand here and actually argue that Brian Mitchell be released, but in doing that the purposes, the objectives of the Constitution and the Act under which this application is brought has to be considered, and I then exhort the Committee to give Brian Mitchell that chance to make amends, because he comes here having served five years in prison.  He comes here also as an individual who has also lost everything.  Yes, I would agree and concede that he has not lost as much as the victims have lost, but the whole purpose of granting of amnesty is so that one may have reconciliation.\nOne of the aspects that has to also be considered by the honourable Members of the Committee and you, Mr Chairman, is that the victims - or the representative of the victims has indicated that there is no opposition being advanced by the victims.  They leave it in the discretion of the Committee.  There is then an - what can be derived from this is that were there to be a release then that release would be acceptable to the victims in the spirit of reconciliation.  And this particular implication or inference may be made from the submission made to you by their legal representative in saying that at this point in time they are unable to forgive, but were the applicant to go and involve himself in the community then the door to forgiveness is still open.

            "Very, very briefly, Mr Chairman, Members of the Committee.  What does give me cause for concern is the fact that the Trust Feed area was - and cannot be better described than in the words of WILSON J during the course of the trial - as a haven of peace at the time when the applicant arrived there.  He arrives as station commander in January 1988 at a time when the Crisis Committee was representative of both the landowners and the tenants.  He then gets involved with Inkatha, helps to form the Landowners Committee, and within -I think it was six months of that committee being organised, violence erupts.  In October, and again November, subsequently the massacre itself.  And one wonders why, if his instructions were to take out the members of the UDF, or those perceived to be members of the UDF, why the extensive police powers which the police had at that time could not have been employed, namely detentions.  That detention concentrates the mind quite considerably.\nHowever, the victims and the next of kin in this matter, through their attorney, have indicated that although they find it difficult at this stage to forgive, and while they do not support the application, they do not oppose it, and that, with submission, is a healthy attitude.  Because I believe, in all fairness to the applicant, and to the victims and the next of kind, there seems to be an embryonic growth towards reconciliation,\n\t/and if\nand if that can be achieved that would be the most marvellous, marvellous thing.\nAnd in those circumstances I do not oppose the grant of this application.  I do not.  I think in fairness as well what my learned friend for the applicant has said in regard to the four special constables - admittedly they were a lesser breed, so to speak, and under the applicant's orders, but the applicant was under superior orders, and no doubt his superior was under superior orders, and that will be investigated and no doubt the truth will come out.  But in the circumstances I think it only fair to say that I certainly do not oppose this application for amnesty.  \nThat is all I have to say unless there are any other matters you wish me to deal with.",
