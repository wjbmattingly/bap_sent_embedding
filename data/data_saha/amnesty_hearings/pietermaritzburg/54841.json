If I may continue Mr Chairman.\n\tMr Chairman the applicants were arrested in connection with what is referred to as the Crazy Beat disco incident in Newcastle on the 15th of February.  The incident itself took place on the 14th of February of 1994.\n\tThe applicants were then charged with murder, attempted murder, unlawful possession of arms and ammunition and grenades.  These charges arose from the shooting which took place at the Crazy Beat disco on the 14th of February.  As a result of the attack on the disco, a 31 year old white female I hope the pronunciation is correct,  Guibrecht Solomina van Wyk was killed.\t\n\tApplicant malevu was convicted.  They appeared in court, he was convicted or murder, attempted murder and the unlawful possession of machine guns.  Applicant Tanda was convicted of murder, attempted murder and unlawful possession of machine guns, grenades and three rounds of ammunition and a pistol.  Applicant Shiceka was convicted of murder, attempted murder, unlawful possession of machine guns and grenades.\n\tMalevu was sentenced to an effective 10 years imprisonment, the trial court having found that he was an accomplice to the murder and the attempted murder as well as being an accessory after the fact.\n\tTanda and Shiceka were found to have perpetrated the attack on the Crazy Beat disco.  They were sentenced to effective terms of imprisonment of 25 years.  The applicants, Mr Chairman, accept that they were properly convicted and sentenced by Judge Hugo, sitting with two assessors on the 24th and 26th of May 1994.\n\tWe submit that the summary of substantial facts in the criminal trial which I see is not part of the record before you Mr Chairman, read together with the facts found by the trial court, and those facts are before you, are substantially correct.\n\tThe trial court also found correctly that the applicants were members, in the case of Mr Malevu, the members of the Pan African Congress and in the case of Messrs Shiceka and Tanda, members of APLA.\n\tThe trial court also found that the attack was politically motivated.   That they acted on orders from the APLA high command and that the applicants gained nothing personally from the attack.\n\tMr Chairman and learned members of the Committee, we submit that on these facts as found by the trial court, albeit with respect, that it is an opinion from another tribunal, we submit that this Committee after hearing evidence will make the same if not similar, the same findings and accordingly we submit that having regard to the Act, and in particular the requirements for amnesty, that the applicants should be entitled to be granted amnesty.\n\tMr Chairman, if I may proceed to call the first applicant to give evidence, Bongani Golden Malevu.",

From there as we are talking here today, we talk about the 20th of March 1966, that was the incident caused by white people, based on racial lines and when we talk about June 16, it is an incident which was caused by white people which was based on racial lines.\n\tAnd other many cases where things were done on racial lines, together with things like the train shootings, therefore we can't stress the racial issue, because we were fighting for the land which was in the hands of the white people, who were not prepared to hand back what belonged to the African people.\n\tTherefore we see that as an oppressive situation, therefore we can't talk of apartheid if we don't see white people.  People who were oppressing the African people in a country where we were born.
