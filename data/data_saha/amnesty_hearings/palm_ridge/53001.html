<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> The next applicant is Mr Ndlovu.  His application appears on page 83 of the bundle called Lusaka-A, page 83.  Mr Simphiwe Godfrey Ndlovu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a>NO RECORDING</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Ndlovu, won't you stand please?  Give us your full names please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">SIMPHIWE GODFREY NDLOVU:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mopedi, still you?   Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR MOPEDI:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a>Mr Ndlovu, you are the applicant in this matter, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> That's right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOPEDI:</span> And you were also a member of the SDU, Thokoza?</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOPEDI:</span> That is for Lusaka-A?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> That is right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOPEDI:</span> And how old were you - first before I come to that question, when did you join the SDU?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Early 1993.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOPEDI:</span> So you joined early 1993?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> That's right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOPEDI:</span> I see in your claim form you say that you joined in 1990 up to May the 10th, 1994, could you explain the discrepancy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> During the time when the application forms were being filled the person who was helping us with this did not have detailed information.  So what he knows is that the amnesty will cover from 1990 until 1994.  So that's the reason maybe why ...(indistinct) in 1990.  But I personally started in SDU during 1993.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOPEDI:</span> You say you joined in 1993?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> That's correct.  How did you join, were you forced to join?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> No, I was not forced.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOPEDI:</span> Who was your commander?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Our commander was Mosa Msimango.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOPEDI:</span> Could you explain to this forum the role that you have played, the active role that you have played.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> Okay.  Due to the reason that I was young and the codes of conduct stated very well that a person should be 18 in order to join the SDU, I was given my task to make sure that every time when the people who were over 18 which were regarded as the battalion, every time they launch an attack or every time ..(indistinct) they will defend I should go first and then I have to make sure that there are no police around that area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a>	To make sure of that I was given a hand radio which I will communicate with them.  Then there were languages which we could communicate in.  For instance, if there were police around I could send a signal that, ...(indistinct) for instance Umdagane Street and the signal it's negative, that they don't have to go through Umdagane Street, maybe they have to change to another street.  And my role was that and to make sure that the guns are safely stored and to clean them.  That was my role.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOPEDI:</span> So were you not actively involved in the fighting itself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> No, I was involved ...(NO RECORDING)</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a>MR MOPEDI:   If I understand you properly, you never pulled a trigger?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> No, I never pulled a trigger.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOPEDI:</span> So why are you applying for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> The reason why I'm applying for amnesty is because when I knew the guns, where they were stored, I never called the police.  And when my friends were about to make an attack or to defend, I knew it but I never told the police.  So regarding to these days maybe that should be regarded as distracting the law.  So I couldn't help the police, so that is why I am applying for amnesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOPEDI:</span> Were you ever given a firearm for you to use?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> No, I was not given a firearm to use, maybe I will be given a firearm to store it or I'll be given a firearm to clean it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOPEDI:</span> So you were not given a firearm because you were under the age of 18, is that what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOPEDI:</span> Were you not - did you at any stage take part in, say in a specific incident where an attack was being launched?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVU:</span> No, I didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOPEDI:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman, no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MOPEDI</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you, Mr Mopedi.  Advocate Steenkamp, any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> No questions, thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a>NO QUESTIONS BY ADV STEENKAMP</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I suppose there is no re-examination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOPEDI:</span> No re-examination, Mr Chairman, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Ndlovu, you are excused, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
