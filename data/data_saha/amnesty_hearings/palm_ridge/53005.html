<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOPEDI:</span> Mr Chairman, I would propose that the other matter which was stood down should be heard, and at the same time I will request to be excused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that the matter of Feni?  Mr Sibeko, will you deal with that one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Alright.  Will Mr Feni come up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Mr Chairman, his application appears on page 113 in the same bundle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are your full names Michael Feni?</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MICHAEL FENI:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Sibeko?</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR SIBEKO:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a>	Mr Feni, do you confirm that you are applying for amnesty in this matter, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR FENI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Do you confirm that you apply for amnesty because of your role in the SDU at Lusaka-A?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR FENI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> When did you join the unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR FENI:</span> In 1993.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Who was your commander at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR FENI:</span> It was Mosa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Do you have specific incidences wherein you were involved as a member of the SDU under Mosa's command?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR FENI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Would you tell us about them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR FENI:</span> Yes, I can tell you.  The first one was in Ngaki when people were taken out of their houses.  Some of them were killed.  I then decided to take part in this because our people were being killed and their houses were being taken away from them.  That is why I decided to be involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Those people who were killed and moved out of their houses, who were killing them and who was busy killing them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR FENI:</span> They were killed by the IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> How do you know that they were killed by IFP members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR FENI:</span> Because they had red bands to show that they were members of the IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Now you indicated that as a result of those attacks or the two incidents that you have just referred to, you decided to join the unit, were you at any stage or did you at any stage carry any weapon whatsoever to that effect?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR FENI:</span> Yes, I did carry a weapon, an AK47.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Now let us start again from the incident that occurred at - the very same incident that you are talking about, what happened after you found out that people were killed and they were moved out of their houses, what did you do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR FENI:</span> What happened is we were forced to attack them because they were killing people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Now will I be understanding you correctly that you also fired shots towards the same people that you are referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR FENI:</span> Can you please repeat your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> You say the IFP members killed people at Ngaki, moved people of Ngaki out of their homes.  Now you joined the unit, as part of the unit did you fire any shots towards members of the IFP, the said members of the IFP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR FENI:</span> Yes, we shot at them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Mr Feni, the question is, did you, not you in a large number of people but you yourself  personally.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR FENI:</span> Yes, I shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Are you in a position to say whether you killed or injured anybody out of that attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR FENI:</span> Yes, there were people who died.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> How do you know that, Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR FENI:</span> It is because I was not shooting, I was not facing on the ground, I was facing at the people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Is there any other incident that you would want to tell us about, except the one that you have referred to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR FENI:</span> Yes, the incident at Buthelezi when there was a helicopter flying in that area, the Stability Unit.  They were burning people's houses in Buthelezi.  They were burning houses and that was a very painful thing.  In that incident I also used that AK47.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Now you say - in fact, in what you're saying you don't mention who those people who were accompanied sort of by the ISU as you say, who were those people who were busy burning people's houses and, who were those people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR FENI:</span> The people who were burning people's houses had red bands.  They were members of the IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> The very same question again, are you in a position to state whether you killed or injured anybody in that attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR FENI:</span> There is no doubt that I might have killed a person, I did kill on that particular day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> What eventually happened to the weapon that you were using, that is the AK47?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR FENI:</span> The AK47 was taken by the Stability Unit, by the police.  They arrested my wife, they took my wife with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> At that time were you aware that - in fact, was it before the campaign wherein people were supposed to hand their weapons over to whoever, who organised that campaign?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR FENI:</span> It was before that campaign.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman, no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MOPEDI</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Advocate Steenkamp?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman, I have no questions.  Thank you, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a>NO QUESTIONS BY ADV STEENKAMP</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Feni, in these two incidents that you've referred to at Mgaki and at Buthelezi, these attackers were burning houses.  Now what did you do there, did you shoot at those people that were burning the houses, with our AK47?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR FENI:</span> We shot at the people who were burning the houses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were these the only two incidents that you were involved in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR FENI:</span> Those are the two that I still remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Sorry, Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a>	What does that mean, Mr Feni, does this mean to say that those were the only incidents that you were involved in or is it to say that there may be other incidents in which you were involved but you cannot remember them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR FENI:</span> I don't remember other incidents.  It doesn't mean that these are the only two.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now when about did these two take place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR FENI:</span> If I'm not mistaken it was in 1993 and in 1994.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> This Buthelezi, the one where the helicopter was involved, which one was that, '93 or '94?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR FENI:</span> I am not sure.  I do not remember when exactly it happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you not sure whether it was in 1993 or in 1994?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR FENI:</span> I'm not sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So both these incidents that you refer to were in the 1993/1994 period, you're not sure?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR FENI:</span> Yes, that is correct, I'm not sure about the dates.  I was also arrested so I couldn't keep on the dates and the years.  I was arrested concerning the AK47.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In which year were you arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR FENI:</span> 1994, maybe in February.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And what happened to that case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR FENI:</span> The Stability Unit members did not attend the Court and I was then released after six months.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So they withdrew the charges against  you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR FENI:</span> Yes, they withdrew them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So are you also asking for amnesty for having had this AK47 unlawfully in your possession?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR FENI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> This AK47, have you only used it in connection with your activities as a member of the    SDU?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR FENI:</span> I was using it only as a member of the SDU.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You have - or let me ask you, have you ever been involved in the Committee of Seven?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR FENI:</span> Yes, I do know about the Committee of Seven.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you involved in any of their activities?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR FENI:</span> I was always with them all the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you help them to do anything like collect money or anything like that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR FENI:</span> I don't remember collecting money.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you help them with anything in particular?</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR FENI:</span> I don't remember clearly except that we would meet in the meetings of the Committee of Seven as a person who was unemployed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Would you just be attending the meetings as a member of the community?</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR FENI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And otherwise you spent a lot of time with some of the members of the committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR FENI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Mr Sibeko?</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">RE-EXAMINATION BY MR SIBEKO:</span> Only one aspect, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a>	Mr Feni, were you an elected member of the Committee of Seven?</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR FENI:</span> I was not an elected member but I had to attend their meetings and to guard them if they were attacked by the IFP, so that I could take part at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBEKO:</span> ...(inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Thank you, Mr Feni, you are excused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is next?</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Mr Chairman, with your permission, that will be the roll for the day.  There will be more applicants tomorrow, but my learned colleagues have informed me that they need to not only consult but also need to do some preparation for tomorrow.  And with your permission, Mr Chairman, this will be the roll for today.  Thank you, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Well I think we have covered quite a bit of ground.  We are going to adjourn the proceedings at this stage, until tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock.  We will reconvene at nine.  We are adjourned.</p>
