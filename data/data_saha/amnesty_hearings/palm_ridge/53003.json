And then yes, we did go there.  I think it was on the third circle at a street that is facing the hostel.\n\tWhen we arrived there myself and Thulani had to make sure that we look out for the police and they were facing a direction towards the hostel.  It was not long before we had arrived there, not more than five minutes.  As we were looking around we heard gunshots after which Simphiwe and Sipho appeared fleeing.\n\tAs our duty to look out for the police, we continued doing that until we returned to our placed.
