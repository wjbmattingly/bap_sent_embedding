<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOPEDI:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.  The next applicant is Mzikayise Tshabalala, page 297, Mr Chairman, 297.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Tshabalala, can you hear?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Will you please stand and give us your full names.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR MOPEDI:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a>	Mr Tshabalala, you are also applying for amnesty, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOPEDI:</span> And you are a former member of the SDUs of Lusaka-A, Thokoza, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOPEDI:</span> If I may ask you, when did you join the Self Defence Unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I joined the Self Defence Unit in 1990, but I was still very young.  I participated by barricading the streets in 1993.  That's when I started holding a firearm for the first time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOPEDI:</span> Were you also involved in fighting members of the IFP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOPEDI:</span> Could you recall specific incidents in which you were involved?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, there is one incident that I was involved in, the Mazibuko incident that has brought me here.  I was present, as it was explained earlier on, I was carrying my AK47 and people died in Mazibuko.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOPEDI:</span> So what you're saying is that you had an AK47 and you fired at the people and some of the people died as a result of the fact that you and others fired?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOPEDI:</span> The people that you were firing at, do you know them and could you tell us if you know their names?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> No, I didn't know their names, I just knew that they were IFP members because some of them were wearing red headbands.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOPEDI:</span> So you in particular, did you kill or injure someone during the fight?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I would say yes, there are some people that I killed or injured, even though I would not be in a position to identify them but yes, I did fire shots.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOPEDI:</span> So pertaining to the fight itself, you confirm what Mr Mahlangu has told this forum?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, I confirm that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOPEDI:</span> Alright.  And about the further incidents, are there any further incidents that you would like to tell us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> One other incident in which I was involved is the Mshayazafe incident.  As explained by the previous applicant, I too was present during that incident.  I was carrying my AK47 and I used it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOPEDI:</span> So at the Mshayazafe incident, do you have any knowledge whether you killed or you injured someone or any person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> I don't have knowledge to that effect but I trust that there must be people that I killed or injured because I was also shooting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOPEDI:</span> When you were shooting, when you were firing a shot or some shots, what was your intention?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> It was to kill.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOPEDI:</span> As to how the incident itself arose at Mshayazafe, do you confirm what Mr Mahlangu has just testified, told us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, as it was explained, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOPEDI:</span> And do you have any further incident that you would like to mention?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, there is the one incident that involves the gangs.  I was one of the people who were patrolling.  That is the Khumalo gang and the Thokoza Bad Boys.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOPEDI:</span> Were you also patrolling with Mr Mahlangu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, I was one of the people in his group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOPEDI:</span> And so you confirm his testimony in respect of that aspect?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, I confirm that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOPEDI:</span> You say you had a firearm that you were using, what happened to that firearm, the AK47?  What happened to it eventually?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> When we came back from Mshayazafe I no longer had a chance because there were soldiers blocking our route and I had to drop it and flee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOPEDI:</span> So you dropped it, that means it might have landed on someone else's hands?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, that may be so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOPEDI:</span> Is there anything that you would like to add to what you have told us already?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> No.  All the testimony I have rendered here covers it all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOPEDI:</span> So are you praying for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Can I just check very quickly.  The Penduka fighting, the Penduka incident, is it part of what you've told us already?  Were you involved in that, Penduka?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> That is the Mazibuko incident, yes I was involved there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Is it the same thing, Mazibuko and Penduka?  Is it the same thing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, it's one and the same thing.  The only difference is that these areas are separated by the street.  From Mazibuko further down is the IFP area and on the other side you have the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOPEDI:</span> Thank you.  Thank you, Mr Chairman, I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MOPEDI</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you, Mr Mopedi.  Advocate Steenkamp, questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> No further questions, thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a>NO CROSS-EXAMINATION BY ADV STEENKAMP</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Panel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Can I also just check, and it's the same incident where Bonga asked for assistance?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSHABALALA:</span> Yes, that's the same incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Any re-examination, Mr Mopedi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOPEDI:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman, no re-examination.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a>NO RE-EXAMINATION BY MR MOPEDI</p>
