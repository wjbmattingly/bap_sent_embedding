He died I understand whilst in prison.\n\tMr Chairman, as you will recall there was an allegation made by the Tsemane family regarding the motive behind the killings in this particular matter, as a result of which the Committee requested the matter to be investigated, which is was.  A report was filed by the Evidence Leader regarding the investigations, and I wish to call today a Mr Charles Mather, a businessman from the Sterkspruit area, who will be in a better position to describe to the Committee the conditions and the perceptions of the community as they existed at that time.\n\tAs a result of possible prejudice to interested persons, notices were sent to inter alia, Mr J H Hatting in terms of Section 19 of our Act, as a possible implicated person.  It was made clear to Mr Hatting's attorney who is present today, Mr N Naude, that Mr Hatting was not directly implicated in any evidence arising from these applications, but that the possibility may exist that by implication his client's rights may be affected.  And for that reason the Amnesty Committee or the Amnesty Department felt obliged to serve him the necessary notice.\n\tIn addition hereto, a Section 19 notice was also served on Mr Buyafuti, a businessman from Sterkspruit.  I understand from Mr Mbandazayo who says that he acts from time to time on behalf of Mr Buyafuti, that he isn't here.  Is that correct, he's not here today?",

When the Transkei was granted independence, I can't remember the year, 1970-something, it was the policy of the then Matanzima's that the white traders should move out of the area.  In fact there was an agreement with the government that you could put your business up for sale and they would come and evaluate it and it was purchased by the then Transkei Development Corporation and they would pay you a very fair price based on goodwill over the last three years, or five years, I can't remember.\n\tAll the white owned businesses were allocated to different people in the Transkei.  We of course refused to sell.  A lot of traders sold, a lot didn't sell.  We weren't forced to, but the general attitude of the government of that time was that the white trader must go and it must be bought by local black business people, Transkei business people.\n\tI do know, I can remember somebody coming into my shop and saying: \"Well, this business is going to be mine one day, it's been allocated to me\" and can I show him around and: \"Can I look at the house?\", and all those types of things.

            "Thank you, Chairperson.\n\tChairperson and Honourable Members of the Committee, I want to remind the Committee that this case we have just finished leading evidence on is one of these cases where the Committee has been hammering the PAC to make submissions regarding the policy of the PAC in cases of this nature, and when I was looking at the record it also reminded me that the Chairperson always wanted and we were trying all our best to get the PAC to come across about its policy regarding incidents of this nature and the submission is before the Committee, the submission which was made by the PAC and it clarified its policy with regard to white persons as targets.  \n\tI don't want, Chairperson, to go to that document, it's well-known to the Members, but I would like to say that during the week I quoted a quotation from Sobukwe who PAC always, they always interpreted the documents which were written by him and also his speeches, and it was from there, even the quotation which is there in the submission which I quoted in full during the week, it was on Tuesday, that quotation.\n\tWhat I'm trying to say is that it's clear that what was done by Mr Dolo and the late Makuala on the day in question was within the framework of the PAC policy and APLA.\n\tChairperson and Honourable Members, you will recall that Dolo was a regional commander and as such he was in a higher position than ordinary commanders who commands a unit to attack.  He also had a discretion to identify the targets and he was also as evidence was led, that he was also, had a task of training and giving lessons to new recruits and Sterkspruit was one of the places where he was doing this training with the recruits and then they would be redeployed somewhere by other people relevant and as such he was in a much higher position.  \tAnd also when it comes to this, he told the Committee that indeed he was reporting to Letklapa Mpahlele with regard to this incident, before and after the incident.  And as such it has the blessing, if one looks then to the policy of the PAC as it also was put in their submission.  So what I'm getting at is that it was what they did they did and they believed that what they were doing was the benefit, was for the benefit of their organisation.\n\tChairperson, I have before me a document which was called Azania Combat, it was the mouthpiece of the PAC military wing, and in this document there are various newspaper reports and also some radio talk shows.  In one of those radio talk shows the then national organiser of PAC was called in Radio Metro talk back show, that what is their position with regard to APLA attacking, then it was called soft targets, and he made it clear, Maxwell Nmatsibanane(?) that they will never condemn APLA for what it's doing because of the roll the enemy, of the role played by the enemy in the settler community.  That is how he put it.\n\tAnd it was the same case when Sabelo Pama came inside the country, he was asked about these incidents and he explained that according to them when it comes to South Africa, inasmuch as he recognised that they are things like soft targets, but when it comes to South Africa he does not think that it applies because from tender age white people are taught how to handle a gun and as such the South African community is, white community is militarised and as such they are targets.  \tAnd that was strengthened by one of the prominent white academics in South Africa, Gary van Staden.  This appeared published on the Saturday Star of the 5th December 1992 and I would like to quote what he said.  He was referring to then what was the first so-called on the white civilian soft targets, the  Golf Club incident.\n\"While he could have articulated his position a little better, PAC Secretary-General, Benny Alexander was quite right to suggest that it was necessary for more white South Africans to die if the problem of political violence is to receive the attention it demands.  While I remain aware that the next victim could be me, or worse my wife or child, we need to be logical and not emotional in addressing the issue of political violence.\n\t\t\tDespite their protestation most white Africans and certainly the Security Forces and the Government, do not respond to the deaths of black victims with nearly as much passion as followed in King William's Town killings.  To dismiss the thousands of township deaths as mere black on black violence is callous in the extreme and morally reprehensible.  \n\t\t\tOnly when all South Africans respond with a deeply felt outrage and anger at each and every death, only when the media begin to print the detail of each and every death with the same depth as according to King William's Town victim, will the message begin to penetrate that we ordinary South Africans of all races gave no-one the right to murder in our name.\"\n\tChairperson and Honourable Members of the Committee, I think Gary van Staden sums up, though this was a very sort passage from what he said, unfortunately I wanted to lay my hands on the paper he presented in Harare regarding this aspect, where he was in the delegation of the media, journalists, BLA(?) to meet APLA outside, it's where he told them that even if I'm a victim but you have to hit at the white South Africans in order to, for them to realise that it is not only happening in the black areas.\n\tSo what I'm trying to get is that even some of the white people, I want to use that name to emphasise what I'm trying to put across, were aware of some of these things and they accepted that as it was put that directly or indirectly, white South Africans benefitted from the oppression of the black people.  There is no doubt that there were those who were on the side, but because of the situation in which ...(indistinct) people were sceptical to accept that, because directly or indirectly he was a beneficiary.\n\tAnd as such, Chairperson, it was, if you take now ordinary cadres who are not policy-makers, which I must conceded that sometimes it was even difficult to PAC to explain the whites, the name settler, and they were at pains when they are pressed to do that.  Now would one ask a question, how much more to an unsophisticated member or follower or cadre who some of them did not go far at school when they have to interpret that and put that into operation.\n\tAnd it's on that basis that you find that there were incidents like this, because they have to put into operation, they were told in simple language that the white person is your enemy.  The only thing they saw was the colour.  \n\tChairperson, it would be said, one would argue that it is racist because ...(indistinct), I don't thinks so.  I would be the first one to argue, I'll concede where it's necessary to concede.  \n\tIt so happened that the people who were oppressing black people were white in colour and it's the same when it comes to black people  who oppressed were black in colour.  Because if you look at what was, APLA did in the early '60's and also late, that collaborators, even black policemen were killed because they regarded them as part of the system.  Chiefs were killed by Pohko because he was a foreigner of APLA.  Why did they kill them if their struggle was racist, instead of directing to the whites?  Because they regarded them as collaborators.  In that way they  put them as part and parcel of the oppressive system.\n\tAnd as such, Chairperson and Honourable Members of the Committee, it is therefore my humble submission that the cadres on the ground applied the policy to the letter and they were not policy-makers when it comes to decisions like this, that the person who was oppressing you is a white person and as such if you want your liberation and if you want your land, you have to kill them, you have to hit at them.  That is the only way you will be able to regain your land.   \n\tAs Dolo put it then that, they put it that it was taken through the barrel of a gun, then if you wanted it you have to fight.\n\tChairperson, I don't want to bore you with my submission.  On that basis it is therefore my humble submission that the applicant, the remaining applicant, Phila Dolo should be granted amnesty as he has satisfied all the requirements of the Act under which this Committee exists.  Thank you, Chairperson.",

            "Thank you.\n\tAgain on behalf of the victims and as Evidence Leader, I would be failing in my duty not to address this Committee fully in this particular incident.  My learned friend has differed from his usual address to the Committee and I'm going to submit, for good reason, because he's unable to raise the same arguments in this particular case as were applicable in other matters, for example like the King William's Town Golf Club attack or the Yellowwoods Hotel attack.  \n\tThis particular incident, Mr Chairman, has a particular brutality attached to it which strikes at one of the elements of gravity, which this Committee must weigh as one of the many factors in whether granting or not of the amnesty.  \n\tNow understanding my learned friend's argument, and we've heard this and we understand the submissions, that it wasn't a racist struggle, it was a struggle against the oppressor, the oppressor was identified as a white person predominantly, whether that white person be a child, an old woman, an informed person or a young healthy person.  There was not distinction as to who the oppressor was among a particular group.  Oppression was associated with a white skin and visa-versa.  \n\tIn this particular case not only do we have Mrs Brummer, a white woman who by all accounts could have been a Xhosa woman because she was accepted by the community of Sterkspruit, who spoke their language and who understood their culture, we have Mr Schroeder, a coloured man who by no stretch of the imagination could be identified as an oppressor.  The evidence of the applicants themselves, Mr Dolo, was that Mr Schroeder was shot when the barrel of the high-powered rifle was put against his neck after the car in which he had been travelling was ambushed and he was callously executed in this manner.  \n\tThere can be no question in the mind of this Committee that the applicants could have been under any impression that this was a white man who was an oppressor who deserved to die for the sake of liberation. \n\tIn addition hereto we have Mr Tsemane, and I want to make a submission in public that the act or the conduct of Mr Tsemane, with respect, was possibly one of the greatest acts that we've heard of in this amnesty process, where a black man gave his life to rescue, not only a white woman or a coloured man, but a human being, and he paid the supreme price.  Was he an oppressor, with respect, was he identified by Mr Dolo as an oppressor?  Mr Chairman, it defies credulity to attack that connotation or that argument to Mr Tsemane.  \n\tMr Tsemane saw the madness, and I want to say madness, that occurred on that day where Mrs Brummer was running in the road and Mr Schroeder was running in the road, being pursued by armed gunmen.  He stopped and picked up Mrs Brummer and was then attacked himself, he lost control of the vehicle and went off the road.  Mr Chairman, this was never properly canvassed, one simply accepted that Mr Tsemane was shot in that exchange of fire, however on a closer reading of the record which was put us, that is the bundle, I want to refer the Committee to the statement which Mr Makuala had written in Sotho which was translated into Afrikaans before a Magistrate and then typed, but at page 33 of the bundle it will appear from Mr Makuala's statement, that after - and that is the first paragraph,  if I may be permitted to quote, he called Mr Tsemane's vehicle the taxi.  He said:\n\"The white people stopped the taxi.  It stopped, they got in and it made a u-turn.  Kenny said there should be no-one shooting because he wanted to aim at it.  He aimed at it and said: 'I hit it.'  I left my spot at that time.  I was with them.  I was with them when he aimed at the vehicle.  The taxi turned but did not drive for a distance and fell into the bridge.\"\nNow the Committee will be aware from the photographs that were handed up, that the vehicle left the road and landed up in what appeared to be a causeway of sorts.  Mr Makuala proceeded to say in his statement:\n\"Soon another vehicle from Sterkspruit approached.  Kenny said that I should hijack it for us to get away.\"\nNow that fits in with the objective evidence of the teachers, the ladies that arrived in a bakkie.\n\"He (referring to Kenny) told Roger and Totina to stand over the bridge to check whether no-one ran away.  I then heard a gunshot.  Kenny too ...\"\n... and I think that's referring to Mr Dolo.\n\"... went over the bridge and also shot.  By that time I had already stopped a vehicle.  Inside were three women.  I told them that I was borrowing the vehicle and that they will find it in Sterkspruit.\"",

            "Mr Chairman, the portion of Mr Makuala's statement to which I'm referring was not specifically put up in respect of this incident, but it was placed before the Committee as part of Mr Makuala's amnesty application in respect of other incidents which were set down at the same time in Aliwal North, although for specific incidents, portions of that statement had been crossed out.  In other words, where portions of that statement were not relevant to the specific hearing at hand, those portions were crossed out.\n\tMy reference thereto is fairly simple and obviously I'm alive to the arguments of my learned friend, that if it wasn't specifically put, Mr Makuala's now deceased, what weight, but I submit that he can reply and argue that.  I simply draw the Committee's attention to the fact that this information does exist, it is before you, although not specifically and formally before you, my submission is that the Committee can have cognisance of all information that's relevant to an inquiry as to whether a gross human rights violation occurred or not.  \tSimilarly we have insight into the PAC submissions of October 7, '97 where these are not specifically placed before the Committee by formal evidence.  Those submissions were made to the HRV Committee and this Committee has insight and cognisance and can take those submissions into account.  So I submit, on a very similar basis this Commission can have cognisance and take cognisance of that information.\n\tMr Chairman, quite simply the point I wish to make is that Mr Makuala in the statement, and he was cross-examined on this aspect in his evidence, as to the identity of the driver of the bakkie or the taxi as it was referred to, that is Mr Tsemane, and the indication from the applicants is that they were unaware that this was a black man, they were unaware that Mr Schroeder was a coloured man or looked coloured, or looked like a coloured person.  \n\tHowever, at page 32 of the bundle to which I refer to, and that's the bundle relating to Lady Grey Farm Attacks, it's on the actual first page of Mr Makuala's typed, that's the English typed translation of his statement, he stated that:\n\"Suddenly a taxi from Sterkspruit approached.  It was only one person driving in that taxi, the driver who was a black person.\"\n\tThe point I wish to make then and to conclude on on that aspect is that at least if they were not aware at the time that Mr Tsemane stopped to pick up Mrs Brummer, then certainly when the vehicle had been shot at and had left the road, they must have been aware that Mr Tsemane was not a white person.  \n\tIt would seem that Mr Tsemane could have been shot, and in all probability was shot at after the vehicle had left the road, if one then looks at the statement he makes regarding shots being fired from the bridge.\n\tMr Chairman, that then brings one to the question of proportionality.  My submission is it is one case, it is one thing to say as APLA have consistently said, they were acting under orders, their information or intelligence was that a specific target was a sanctioned target.  For example the King William's Town Golf Club, where in military style and with military style precision the club was attacked, persons were killed during the operation and there was the withdrawal.  \n\tI submit that this particular incident, with respect, can be distinguished on the facts.  Here the applicants were not satisfied with simply attacking the target, being a white person driving the vehicle, in terms of their orders, but they went beyond that, they were not satisfied in injuring the persons, they proceeded to execute, to kill persons that had already been injured and that never posed any threat to them and could not have by their deaths, have furthered any political objective that they had in mind because by the initiating of the attack as they did, the political statement had already been made.\n\tSo in respect of this particular application, my submission is that Mr Dolo in particular has not satisfied the requirements of the Act, particular Section 20, and that he is not entitled, he has not discharged the onus that rests on him to satisfy this Committee that he is entitled to amnesty.\n\tMay I also mention, and this was also canvassed during the evidence, that after this specific incident they proceeded to the Sterkspruit Hotel where they robbed it.  There an amount of R65 000 was taken and the evidence was that it was because they were hungry, they felt hungry, they went past there and they robbed the hotel.  Surprisingly enough no-one in the hotel, which included the white manager, Mr le Roux, was not killed, he wasn't shot.  That doesn't, somehow it does not gel with their earlier evidence that their object was to kill white people, people involved or identified with the oppression.  And although that Sterkspruit Hotel is not specifically before the Committee, there's doesn't seem to be any explanation or any suggesting by Mr Makuala or Mr Dolo that that money was handed over to the hierarchy.\n\tAt the level of suggesting that they have not, in respect of the Herschel/Lady Grey Attack, they have not taken the Committee into their confidence.  For example, Mr Dolo steered judiciously away from admitting that the vehicle which Mr Tsemane was driving was in fact driven by a black man and that Mr Schroeder in his view was a white person, I submit he realised the difficulty that he was in and steered judiciously away from that.\n\tFor those reasons, Mr Chairman, I submit that Mr Dolo has not satisfied the requirements of the Act and he should be refused amnesty.  Thank you.\nMR SIBANYONI(?): Mr Mbandazayo, before you reply I would like you to address the Committee on this aspect, the white person who was driving a 4X4, the one from the Telkom, was not killed, and then when I look at the evidence it is said that Dolo ordered Kleintjie to shoot at the car not at the white person and - ja, if you can cover that in your address, thank you.",

I would just briefly reply on the aspects raised by Mr Prior.\n\tChairperson, the question of the evidence and the information, that is the statement by Mr Makuala, Chairperson, I have no qualms about the statement, that it was made by Mr Makuala, the only thing is that, my question is that how much weight should be attached to it because Makuala was subjected to a very lengthy cross-examination regarding some aspects of his statement, but none this was, which was the subject of the hearing to ask him to comment as to why his evidence is contrary to what he gave before the magistrate.  That was not done and unfortunately there is no question that now he can be called to answer that.  So that information was never tested.\n\tInasmuch as my learned friend is saying that this Committee should do as it did with the submission of the PAC before the HRV Committee, Human Rights Violations Committee, I think that information, that statement, submission of PAC was tested because those people who were there to make the submission were questioned lengthily about all those submissions, and as such it was accepted as part because they were required to do that.\n\tWith this statement of Mr Makuala one can raise many questions, as it did, that he was tortured by the police, it was not voluntary, all those things.  There are many questions that can be raised with this statement.  So it cannot be likened to the submission, the statement made by Mr Makuala.\n\tComing to the point that they were shot, these words \"they were injured\", I think they made it clear that their purpose was to kill, it was not to injure anybody.  It may be the opinion of Mr Prior that he feels that this political statement was made, but to them that was a totally different matter, they had to kill those people and they did exactly that.  And as such, the question of injuring ...(indistinct), their purpose, their mission was to kill and they did exactly that.\n\tComing to the question of Sterkspruit Hotel.  With due respect, inasmuch as the evidence would portray as it if was after that, they were questioned at length.  They went home, they went to their area after that incident.  It was after that, it was not the same day that this happened.  It never happened the same day, the question of the Sterkspruit Hotel.  \n\tAnd inasmuch as it was mentioned during the evidence, but it was not the subject of, though they were questioned about it and who was involved.  I still remember it was because there were many names and these names kept on cropping up and that the name of Mr Dolo, Kenny, was there and where he said he was not there and ended up saying it was not Dolo, Kenny was not this Dolo.  I still remember it in those things when he was questioned about the names which were there.  He kept on changing the names, Mr Makuala, that it's not this one, he was making a mistake it was another incident.  So it came during that time, the question of the hotel.\n\tNow coming to the question of this 4X4, the other ...  I think if I may, maybe the Honourable Member interpreted it as if he was saying he must just shoot at the car.  My interpretation I thought that he was saying he must shoot at the car, at the person but who was driving the car.  That's how I interpreted it, that the instruction to Makuala was that he must shoot at that car.  So I interpreted it that he must shoot to the occupant of the car, but it may be interpreted the other way around.  But my interpretation was that at the time when the evidence was led was that he must shoot at the person.   But I think Mr Makuala indicated that I think he missed it, he was unable to hit at the car, but I think the instruction was, my interpretation, but I cannot take it any further, Honourable Member, if that's how you saw it.  My interpretation was that I thought that when you're saying shoot at the car, you must shoot at the occupant together.  He will shoot through the car in order to get the occupant.\n\tThe other last point I would like to make is that of Mr Tsemane.  I think that was made clear by the applicants, that he was not part of them, it's only after they have shot at the car, because it was said that the view, since it was in the morning they could not see properly.  And they indicated that it was not their intention to kill, but they did shoot at the car and it ended up falling on the other side of the, in the bridge.  But I don't think we can make much about that, as if they did it, they saw him as he was reading at the statement.   It's another thing to make a statement after the event because you have a knowledge now.  They were aware a the time he was making a statement that that person who was killed was a black man, not necessarily at the time when the incident happened that he knew.  \n\tAnd these, Chairperson, are the dangers which I was seeking to avoid when I said, when it was not tested and the applicant asked about that you will have different interpretations about the whole matter.     Thank you, Chairperson.\n\tThe other aspect.  I would like some of these incidents, I would like the Committee to take into account is that some of these incidents, Mr Makuala was not arrested for, was arrested for another matter and they mentioned some of these incidents.  And especially also Dolo, he made an application, he was never arrested, he was never any suspect, he just gave the information voluntarily.  He applied for amnesty not knowing that he was involved in the whole of this matter.  Thank you, Chairperson.",

If I may, we had one of the similar cases which I think Mr Lax was sitting in one of the Committees which something like this happened in Natal, where a taximan was shot at accidentally and it was during this and they were granted amnesty.\n\tWe had similar incidents like this.  And also an ambush of this nature, but none of the members of the Committee were present in Johannesburg, which happened at Vereeniging Road, where Zola Mabala who was an applicant in Heidelberg was also an applicant.  It was the same like this, an ambush, and he was granted amnesty by the Committee.  So we've had some similar cases of this nature which actually did take place.",

It may have been that they regarded the person who was assisting as part and parcel, as a corroborator or whatever nature, that he's trying to save you know, the target, their target and as such he ended up being one of the targets also, as a result of that.

I just would like you to be clear about that.  And then in relation to that, the proportionality aspect.  Can you just help us there?  Because it's one thing to talk about white people being fair game so to speak, in terms of no distinction between soft and hard targets, I understand all of that, but these individuals had a specific objective in mind and I just want you to address again that objective and then in relation to that objective, the proportionality of these killing.",

When Mr Dolo was asked many times about that and he did not mince his words when he said\n\"Look, we wanted to stop them coming to Sterkspruit and wanted to drive them away.\"\nIn a way I think it was, if I'm not mistaken, Mr Lax himself, when he said that in a way he wanted to create a liberated area.  That is what he said in evidence.  That\"\n\"We wanted to drive them away as they were doing in the farms, that we wanted to create liberated areas where we can operate in order to launch further attacks.\"\nHence their aim he said that it was to repossess the land.\n\tNow coming to the question of proportionality.  Through you, Chairperson, I'm always, there's one point which I'm always having difficulty to address and one would always ask in proportion to what?  Because what I'm - my argument is always and again I will use the same argument that this question of proportionality it's my argument, I may be wrong, that it should be applied to the policy-makers.  The policy-makers are responsible for that.  \n\tFor instance, if the authors of apartheid, if I may make an example, the Parliament makes but it's not always the case that legislatures are the people who are applying that, ordinary people on the ground were applying it differently.  But if you look broadly you find that this emanates from somewhere and the reason why they were that, they know that they are protected because this is covered.  And as such you cannot then punish those people who are applying it, saying look it must be applied to them.  That's my argument, that proportionality should be applied to the people, to the policy-makers who are responsible for that, not the ordinary foot-soldiers.",

He was not doing without seeking the approval first to show that he cannot do as he likes, that must be approved.\n\tIf you still remember, for instance there was an exchange to that effect: when did you phone?

            "Mr Chairman, I don't think we should confuse the issues here.  We all understand that APLA was operating as a military organisation and they had specific targets and objectives for a specific purpose.  And even for example, if one looks at the attacks on motorists at the Mayaphuti Bridge, and even if one accepts that white people going about their normal business were legitimate targets, the question of gravity and proportionality must feature in the final analysis because APLA, as we've heard in the submissions, weren't an undisciplined organisation, they had structures, they regarded themselves as soldiers.  In terms of their own 15 points of conduct they weren't able to mistreat captives or prisoners and their own rules made provision for that.\n\tNow Mr Schroeder who had been injured seriously, shot through the body, lying there, to have his head blown away as it was, or Mr Tsemane who was assisting Mrs Brummer who had been shot or injured, I submit it goes beyond what a soldier does, it goes beyond the objective.  They had achieved their objective, it wasn't necessary, it wasn't justified, it served no political purpose or objective to execute the people as they did.  And that is the question that Mr Lax has properly put, therein lies the proportionality, that the deaths weren't justified in those specific circumstances.\n\tAnd understanding everything that has been said and understanding about the way they operated on the ground, we have understanding to that, but once they had finished the attack it seems that the people were in a very callous and cold-blooded manner dispatched, when it was totally unnecessary to do so.  So I submit that that is a factor or a feature that this Committee must bear in mind and must strongly weigh against the simple statement that we were carrying out orders and we had no ...  Mr Dolo was the regional commander, he wasn't a foot-soldier as has been correctly pointed out, he could decide.  They went on training runs, as the Committee heard, they tested their weapons, they were able to withdraw, they were able to choose, they weren't simply robots carrying out orders under pain of death.

And in fact because we don't have a clear chain of accountability further up, because we know that APLA chose targets or allowed the local commanders to choose the targets, what they were doing was part of a broad offensive but there is not clear line of accountability beyond Mr Dolo except for example, Mr Letklapa Mpahlele who says well we accept responsibility because it was part of, he never gave a specific order to do that specific attack.\n\tSo Mr Dolo chose the target, he must ultimately be responsible for that decision and everything that flowed from that incident.

            "...(indistinct) he shot Mr Smit out a feeling of hatred towards him.  That was the evidence.  He may have said Letklapa said \"shoot him\", but that wasn't the compelling reason.  And then if I may just start my argument in an ordered fashion.\n\tThis Committee must also decide properly, in terms of Section 20.3, whether Mr Gqomfa has satisfied those requirements.  Now he's told us about his motive, which was the liberation of Azania and that entailed the killing of white people across the board, because we know what he did in Heidelberg.  I submit that that can be distinguished in this particular case again.  And Mr Lax has already identified the difficulty in this case, and I will emphasise it as the question of gravity and proportionality.\n\tNow it can't be argued, and the Chairman has correctly pointed out they had no idea whether these occupants of this vehicle were military trained or not until they alighted and were running for their lives.  But how does one accept the veracity of the entire basis of the motivation of Mr Gqomfa when one of the occupants is a black person and must have clearly have been visible.  When the car was coming slowly across the Mayaphuti Bridge - we're seen the photographs, it's a narrow bridge, in fact there's a stop street on either side of the bridge, there could have been no doubt in Mr Gqomfa's mind that here in the car was a black person who the orders were not to kill.  But nevertheless they shoot at this vehicle in order to bring it to a standstill and they succeed, reckless or not, whether the black person who was not their target would be killed or not, and I think it was only a miracle that this person was not in fact seriously injured or killed. \tThen we deal with the situation that Mr Smit who was badly injured, was shot through the legs, the upper legs, was unable to get away, he crawls a distance away from the vehicle and he is in a sitting or crouched position next to the road when his attackers come up to him.  \n\tThe Committee will recall that Mr Gqomfa, after some probing in cross-examination, conceded that the man may well have been pleading for his life before he shot him in the chest with a high-calibre and high-powered rifle.  Whether the shot of Mr Letklapa was necessary in the circumstances we don't know, possibly that was the coup de grace.  But in any event, my submission is that cannot be associated with any political objective or any known political objective as stated by Mr Gqomfa.\n\tAnother aspect which this Commission cannot ignore, or this Committee cannot ignore, was whether the act, omission or offence was committed as part of any political uprising, disturbance or event or in reaction thereto.  This occurred during 1992 at a stage when all political parties were unbanned, they were all participating in the democratic process.  In fact it was not via the efforts of APLA that liberated this country, we all know as a fact that it was through negotiation and through parties sitting down and putting aside their prejudices and differences, that the democracy was born.\n\tThe other feature that this Committee cannot ignore ...(intervention)",

So what I'm saying is  that what we hear in this application is simple political rhetoric, that they had to liberate this country through the barrel of a gun.

I can't remember the exact place, but the simple fact was he said: \"look, I was a soldier, I had a job to do, I did it.\"  If I paraphrase him not quite correctly I apologise but it was words to that effect.  Does that not keep it within the realms of the political object, if you like?",
