<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">BENJAMIN MVUYISI YOYO:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Be seated.  Mr Obose?</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR OBOSE:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Yoyo, you are a member of the South African Police Services.  Where are you attached?</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR YOYO:</span> I am based at number 12, Vulinglela, as a Station Commander.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR OBOSE:</span> What rank do you hold?</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR YOYO:</span> I am a Superintendent.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR OBOSE:</span> During March 1994, what rank were you holding?</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR YOYO:</span> I was a Sergeant because of demotion that was caused by Gqozo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR OBOSE:</span> Can you just briefly state that, explain that, elaborate a little bit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR YOYO:</span> It means that before I used to be a Lieutenant and I was demoted by Gqozo's regime in 1991 to the rank of a Sergeant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR OBOSE:</span> Were you happy with this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR YOYO:</span> Not at all because it was a very bad situation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR OBOSE:</span> Did you go to this meeting which was at Police College, Bisho on the 22nd of March 1994?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR YOYO:</span> Yes, I attended the meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR OBOSE:</span> How did you get to know that there was such a meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR YOYO:</span> I got the information when I was at the station, I heard that through the radio that all the Police were summoned to the College and they were still there, some Police were still there, therefore I decided to go.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR OBOSE:</span> Roughly what time did you get to the meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR YOYO:</span> I arrived at about four o'clock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR OBOSE:</span> What did you find there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR YOYO:</span> The hall was packed inside and outside, the Policemen were there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR OBOSE:</span> Yes, and what was going on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR YOYO:</span> The people were singing, ululating, the Police were singing inside the hall the songs about Gqozo and I also took part.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR OBOSE:</span> You joined in the singing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR YOYO:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR OBOSE:</span> Did you get inside the hall?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR YOYO:</span> Yes, I got inside the hall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR OBOSE:</span> Did you participate in the deliberations inside the hall?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR YOYO:</span> Yes, that is correct.  The role that I played there in the hall, inside the hall was to collect the firearms from the Officers.  I was keeping those firearms at the table in front, the table that was in front.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR OBOSE:</span> All right, maybe let me just go back there.  You got into the hall and got assigned a certain task maybe or you volunteered to perform a certain task when you got into the meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR YOYO:</span> There were people who were assisting as people were coming in, so that the firearms should be kept in a safe place so that they could cause no danger.  More especially to the soldiers, Gqozo's soldiers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR OBOSE:</span> So the Officers were disarmed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR YOYO:</span> As they were there, all of them, they would hand over their guns nicely and I would write down and when it is time to leave, they would be given their firearms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR OBOSE:</span> Were you seated at the table where Warrant Officer Mfene and others were or in your separate table?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR YOYO:</span> I was sitting with a long table, similar to the one that is in front right now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR OBOSE:</span> Why were the Officers disarmed, whereas the other Police members had their firearms with them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR YOYO:</span> As they were coming in, I would tell them to bring their firearms to me so that they could go and sit in front nicely there, to ensure that no firearms would be used inside the hall and they were all told with certainty that nothing was going to happen to them.  Therefore they sat there happily.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR OBOSE:</span> What I want to clear is the other Police were armed, isn't that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR YOYO:</span> In front, on the podium, the Officers were sitting there and as a person who was there, the person who was in front of the microphone was Inspector Mfene.  He was unarmed because I did not see a firearm on his body.  Each and everyone who was on the podium, I had to ensure that nothing bad could happen.  The people were singing on the other side.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR OBOSE:</span> I see.  What did you then do with these firearms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR YOYO:</span> I kept them, they were in one place, just in front of me, and I had recorded each and every firearm in the book, that is the job that I was doing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR OBOSE:</span> These Officers, how did they get to be there, do you know?  Did they go there voluntarily, were they fetched or what was the general reason that was held as to why they had to be there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR YOYO:</span> Some of them were already there when I arrived, they were sitting there happily and some of them came, whereas the others were already there.  It is not all of them who were there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR OBOSE:</span> Do you know as to why they were there at all, the Officers, did you hear of any reason?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR YOYO:</span> Those who arrived later on to join the others, those are the Officers that were not there before.  The others were already there and the others were not there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR OBOSE:</span> Thank you, thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR OBOSE</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Obose.  Mr Nompozolo, any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, yes I've got a few.  Mr Yoyo, is it correct that some Officers were fetched from time to time during the course of the day, the evening and the early hours of the morning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR YOYO:</span> Some of the Officers came later, they were coming in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> Is it correct that the Officers who were fetched, first there would be an allegation against the Officer and then it would be announced that that Officer should be fetched?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR YOYO:</span> Will you please repeat your question sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> Is it correct that if an Officer is to be fetched, first there would be an allegation that he had done A, B, C amongst other things, misappropriation of funds, then after that, after that allegation, it would be announced that the Officer should be fetched from his home or from the office, wherever he or she might be?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR YOYO:</span> As all the Officers were brought to the hall, the aim was to remove Gqozo who was a pain in Ciskei, this one of misappropriation of funds are one of those things that came about as the Police were there in the hall.  It is not that all these Policemen were fetched because of misappropriation of funds.  The aim was to get all those who were closer to Gqozo, so that Gqozo should step down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> How were you hoping that Gqozo is going to step down by taking in the Officers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR YOYO:</span> I had hoped that would happen because it eventually happened that when all the Officers were there, Gqozo stepped down.  That rendered great help because all of them were there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> But other Officers were fetched during the early hours of the 23rd and the evidence is that Gqozo had resigned by eight o'clock on the 22nd?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR YOYO:</span> The announcement of Gqozo stepping down, took place way after eight o'clock, all the Officers were there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR NOMPOZOLO</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Any questions Ms Collett?</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS COLLETT:</span> Just a few.  What right did you have to disarm the superior Officers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The witness is listening at the wrong channel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR OBOSE:</span> It is the right channel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR YOYO:</span> I can't hear you.    Will you please repeat the question, Ma'am?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MS COLLETT:</span> What right did you have to disarm the senior Officers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR YOYO:</span> I was a Sergeant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MS COLLETT:</span> But these were your superiors, why were you allowed to disarm them, what reason?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR YOYO:</span> Even the person who was sitting in front, was not an Officer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MS COLLETT:</span> As I understand your evidence, you disarmed all the senior persons who sat on the podium?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR YOYO:</span> The people who were coming in, whereas the others were already there on the podium, but those who were coming in, my duty was to collect their firearms.  We were not taking those firearms by force, they would be told that they would be sitting there nicely and their firearms would be kept safely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MS COLLETT:</span> Why would there firearms be taken from them though?  Why couldn't they keep them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR YOYO:</span> We wanted to keep their firearms safe and there was no complain after that and there was no complain before.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MS COLLETT:</span> But surely being senior Policemen, they were capable of keeping their own firearms safe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR YOYO:</span> Each and everyone there, the people who got up to the podium, would be able to keep their firearms, but I had to keep their firearms.  The firearms of all the people who were on the podium, I had to keep their firearms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MS COLLETT:</span> You see, you are not answering my question, I want to know why.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR YOYO:</span> If you go  up to a place like that, like a podium, your firearm should be kept safely somewhere else.  Even the soldiers who were senior soldiers, their firearms were with me, I had to keep them.  The reason being that we wanted the people to sit there nicely, nothing bad was happening, the people were just singing as they were sitting there.  We had to take their firearms, there was nothing else.  People sometimes do commit suicide after having some thoughts, so we had to keep their firearms safe and we succeeded in doing that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MS COLLETT:</span> Is that regular practice to take firearms away from senior Officers if they sit on the podium?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR YOYO:</span> We had to keep safe their firearms for each and everyone who would be going up the podium.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MS COLLETT:</span> On other days besides this day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR YOYO:</span> That was a normal procedure to keep the firearms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MS COLLETT:</span> Would you agree with me that the senior Officers were on the podium unarmed, whilst all the other Policemen that were in the hall, were armed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR YOYO:</span> I am talking about that particular podium.  The people who were not on the podium, were singing.  I am talking about the podium that I was on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MS COLLETT:</span> Yes, I know, but do you agree with me that the other Policemen that were in the hall, had firearms?  Their firearms were not taken from them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR YOYO:</span> Even those who were on the podium, some of them were armed, more especially the white Officers because we couldn't touch them at the time.  I am certain that they had firearms, the white Officers, that is.  A person who would come in, would hand over the firearm to me for safekeeping.  He wouldn't be forced to do so, he would just place it on the table.   Because it is what was said that nothing was going to happen to those Officers, therefore they should just hand over.  There was order in that hall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MS COLLETT:</span> Were those superior Officers that were on the podium, guarded with people who had firearms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR YOYO:</span> I am the one who was sitting there with them, what do you mean guarding them?  They were already under guard because they were sitting there in order with me, as I was also on the podium.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MS COLLETT:</span> I mean were there other soldiers who were not senior Officers that were pointing firearms at the senior Officers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR YOYO:</span> No one was pointed at with a gun.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MS COLLETT:</span> No further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS COLLETT</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Mr Mapoma, any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Chairperson, thank you, I've got no questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a>NO CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MAPOMA</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Mapoma.  Has the panel got any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> No questions, thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Any re-examination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">RE-EXAMINATION BY MR OBOSE:</span> One question Mr Chairman.  You mentioned soldiers, what had they gone there to do or what did they do even when they got there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR YOYO:</span> They were just sitting there and they were also interested in getting Gqozo down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR OBOSE:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR OBOSE</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Obose.  Mr Yoyo, thank you, you are excused.</p>
