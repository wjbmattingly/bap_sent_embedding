<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I'm Judge Pillay and I'm going to ask my colleagues and the various representatives to announce themselves for the purposes of the record.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE POTGIETER:</span> Denzil Potgieter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIBANYONI:</span> I'm J B Sibanyoni.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> I'm Zuko Mapoma, the Evidence Leader.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> Lundi Nompozolo for the applicant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Chairperson, I'm calling the application of Moses Vuyani Mamani, application number 5265/97.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes Mr Nompozolo?  Is this the applicant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> That is correct, Mr Chairperson.  Thank you Chairperson.  Chairperson, first let me apologise for starting so late.  I have sent one of my articled clerks at about 8 o'clock to go and fetch the applicants so that they may depose to an affidavit which I have drafted on their instructions.  Now there was a communication breakdown between the applicant and my articled clerk.  I left my office at about ten to nine and I learnt about half past nine that that was the time they met, the applicant and my articled clerk.  That is the reason for the delay, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What was the actual reason for the delay?  Are you saying the communication breakdown was the reason for the delay?</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> Thank you, that is correct, Chairperson, the communication breakdown between them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You know, from certain quarters in this country they always point fingers at our people from this end of the country, the Eastern Cape.  I really don't believe that our people are incapable of telling time and doing normal things like normal people do.  I'm getting tired of people saying in the Eastern Cape we're always delayed because of communication gaps, breakdowns and we can't tell time, etc.  The time has come for us to behave like other people and be punctual when we must be punctual.  I hope you can carry that over to your clients.  We're not busy playing games here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a>	Mr Mamani, what language would you choose to speak?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> Xhosa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MOSES VUYANI MAMANI:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mamani, before you attorney carries on, which hotel are you staying at?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> Holiday Inn.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why were you late?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> I didn't know at what time the hearing was going to start and the person who came I saw him at about half past nine and he told us that we were needed to attend because Mr Nompozolo is expecting us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You received notice of this hearing, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What did the notice say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> It said that the hearing is going to take place from the 1st up to the 5th, it will start at about 9 o'clock.</p>

<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why was it necessary for you to be collected like a little boy or a little child and be brought here, why couldn't you see to it that you were here yourself?  You were not in jail, you were not kept back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> I do not know this area, I don't even know the place that I am right now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, if you have any future applications that you have to appear for and not necessarily before me, you see to it that you are here on time, do you understand?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> After all you are the person that's making the application, do you understand?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> Yes I do understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> There are many other people who need to have their hearings done, in particular those who are still languishing in jail and we haven't got time to waste.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson, the applicant has deposed to an affidavit and I think for the purposes of the record I will read the affidavit and we ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why were we not blessed with a copy thereof?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.  Mr Chairperson, I once more apologise on what they did this morning, they went to my office, the applicants, and they were only given the original to go on commission whereas the instruction I gave was that they must be given the affidavit and the copies and then they can only be commissioned by the police here.  Instead they were only given, Chairperson, just the original.  Chairperson, the copies are on the way, I have arranged that they be dispersed to here as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Nompozolo, it doesn't end there, why wasn't this affidavit and your work completely like last week?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> Thank you Chairperson, we had a problem, we only got instructions last week and the applicants only arrived yesterday at about 9 o'clock from Cape Town.  The applicants are from Cape Town.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you could not contact the applicants before then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> I was told Chairperson that the applicants don't have money they will have to be paid for by the TRC and to be booked for in the hotel by the TRC and they only arrived yesterday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Carry on.</p>

<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> Now why did you go into exile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> After becoming a member of MK in 1985 I realised that it was difficult for me to operate as a member of the organisation and the police knew that we were involved therefore we were told that we should cross the borders.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> Now did you receive military training?</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> Where?</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> I was trained in Angola.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> When did you come back to South Africa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> I came back to South Africa in 1991.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> Do you still recall the incident at Frankfort?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> Can you tell the Commission what happened?  I'm sorry, Chairperson, when did that take place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> That took place in 1992, in August 1992.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> Yes, what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> It was myself and four comrades, I was the fifth one.  We went to a police station at Frankfort.  When we arrived there there was a policeman who was in the van outside sleeping and the other one was sleeping in the police station in the main building of the police station.  We awakened the other one who was sleeping in the car and we told him to open and wake up his colleague who was sleeping inside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> Just before we proceed with that, how did it come about that you were a group of five and you went to Frankfort, what happened before that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> After coming from the exile I worked for the African National Congress in the security department.  In 1992 myself and the other comrades who were guarding Comrade Chris Hani, he had given us the instruction to collect the firearm so that we could be able to defend our communities and to be able to train the people for defence in our communities and we decided that the place to get the firearms was this police station, that is why we went to that police station.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> So the people who went to the police station, from whom did they get the instruction to do that, who authorised that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> First of all it was an agreement from all of us to go to that particular police station and get firearms as we had been there during the day on that particular day and we realised that it was possible for us to get firearms there therefore we took that decision.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who gave the order or who authorised it, the plan to go to the police station?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> We got that authorisation from Chris who told us to try and organise some weapons in order to train and protect the community, that became our responsibility as soldiers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In which capacity did Mr Hani give that approval, as head of what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> At the time of the incident he was in the higher ranks of the MK as the chief of the MK.  He issued that instruction as the Chief of Staff.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> Thank you.  Now you are saying you went there as a group.  Did you belong to any political organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He's already said whatever he said was in as a member of the ANC and in particular as an operative of MK.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> Now you are already there now, you've woken up this policeman.  What happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> After ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who was in command of that small unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> The commander of this particular unit was Comrade Mamalise.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes?  do you know his surname?</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> Mamalise Sewu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> When I arrived at this police station I saw a policeman sleeping and we woke him up and we told him to go and ...(inaudible) and we looked at the police station and saw the van outside and next to the police station and realised that there was a policeman inside with a firearm between his legs and we could see in the same van there was another policeman but we're not sure if he had a firearm.  We told this other policeman and knocked and the police station and ...(inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> Can you hear me?  Any sound coming on 2?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> When we arrived at the police station there was a police van in front of the police station.  We tried to look around.  After that we realised that there were two policemen and the other one was sleeping in this police van, the one that was outside the police station but the doors were not locked and the other policeman was sleeping inside the police station on a chair.  We could see that through some opening and this policeman had a firearm.  We woke the one policeman that was outside sleeping in the van, we told him to go and knock at the police station and wake this other policeman up because we were there to get firearms at the police station.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that what you told the policeman that was sleeping in the van?</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> Yes, when he woke up he was scared, that's what we told him and he was shaking because we were also armed with firearms pointing at him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What did you have?</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> I was armed with an Uzzi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> A lot of people talk about an Uzzi, what is it's correct name or is that the correct name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> That is what I know, that is the only name that I know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, carry on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> This policeman was frightened, he was not relaxed he was scared.  We told him that he was not going to be hurt but he must just open the door and we told him that we knew that there was a safe inside and we wanted him to open there so that we could get the firearm.  At the time we were - it's not all of us who were talking to him but I remember myself and this policeman, there was a struggle and I overpowered him and he fell.  After falling I went straight there to the door and I kicked the door open.  We got in, the two of us, and there was firing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You are talking too fast.  You went there and you asked the police to open the door.  What happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> The police did not open the door, we ended up struggling with each other.  He was holding me because he was trying to hide behind me, that's what I was thinking at the time and I ended up overpowering him, I hit him and he fell and after that I turned looking at the door where I kicked the door open, the door of the police station.  After that the door was opened and the one policeman who was inside stood up.  During that process when we were getting in after kicking the door a shot rang outside.  When I turned trying to see what was happening and Mamalise said "this person is running away", he said this person was running away, apparently he had shot this person.  I ignored that, I went back to the house, to the building.  This other policeman's firearm had fallen on the other side because he was also shot.  We took the firearm and we told him to open the safe and he told us that the keys belonging to the safe were not with them they were just there on duty for the night, they were not keeping the keys for the safe and he was also shaking, he was scared, crying at the same time.  We tried to calm him down, we told him that he was not going to be hurt even the one who was injured outside, it was all his fault, that's what I told this policeman inside, I told him that he was not going to be hurt because of his own fault, he was also frightened.  I told him to run away or to leave.  He ran away and we went out of the police station firing in the air and we were also running towards the gate, we were just firing in the air.  We went back to the car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you leave the firearms with the safe or what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> We left the firearms in the safe because we couldn't open the safe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So did you get anything?</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> Yes.  We got two firearms, a 9 mm parabellum and a .38.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What did you people take there?  Go slowly?</p>

<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where did you find these two firearms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> One firearm was with the policeman who was inside but it was not in his hand.  After kicking the door open I saw the firearm that had fallen on the other side and the policeman was standing on the other side crying and the second pistol we got it from the policeman who was outside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was there any ammunition in the firearms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> Yes there was ammunition, yes there was ammunition in both of them.</p>

<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> When we left the police station we drove to a certain house in Mdantsane.  When we arrived there this house was used by the comrades, the ANC comrades were using this house.  We got in there and we made friends with these comrades but they didn't know anything about our visit but they saw the firearms but they didn't know how did we get the firearms and the operations that we were involved in, they knew nothing about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What eventually happened to those firearms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> We went to Cape Town with these firearms.  After that as we wanted the firearms to train people we gave these firearms to the other people to train the comrades.  That was the last time we saw those firearms, we handed them over to the comrades in the townships in order to train the other people.</p>

<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I didn't ask you how many comrades, I asked who did the firearms - who received the firearms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> We gave them to comrade Dalasile, he was the one who was keeping the firearms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who was Dalasile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> Dalasile was a comrade who was also a member of the MK, who was also a member of SANCO.</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But was it his job to see to training or to co-ordinate training in Cape Town?</p>

<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> I did not see him after this incident of the police station.</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you know whether a report was made to him about the success or otherwise of this operation at the police station?</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> I suspect but I cannot say for sure because after that we were taken by the provincial command who wanted a report and he made that report.</p>

On our way to this place we met with a police van, they tried to stop us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How many of you were there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> The three of us, it was myself Monagise and Muntsu.  Muntsu was a driver, Monagise was occupying the passenger seat and I was at the back seat of the car and we were armed because we were expecting anything to happen at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a>	We met with this police van that was coming from behind.  I saw them when they were flickering lights, trying to pull aside and wait.  We did not want to stop here and we told the driver to continue driving, he was told by Monagise to continue.  As we were approaching the cross-roads junction and Monagise told him to continue driving and turn to the right hand side and accelerate.  Just before he could do that, as he was trying to turn to the right hand side at this cross-roads junction, as we were still approaching this cross-roads junction, the police van was trying to overtake and block the way at the front and we had to go through to the left hand side of the car and firing took place in that process.  Monagise was armed with an R5 rifle, he fired and shouting to the driver to stop the car and the car stopped and we alighted ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So both parties started to shoot at each other, there was a shoot-out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> No, the first person to shoot as far as I can remember was Monabise.  When the police were trying to overtake Muntsu was trying to turn to the right but the police tried to overtake on the left hand side and block the car and they came straight to Monabise's side and he started firing and he shouted that the driver should stop the car and then the car stopped.  We alighted and we were shooting going towards the van.  Before I could alight from the vehicle I realised that the van was no longer on the road, it was on the other side of the pavement and it looked like there was a stone on the other side, a big stone.  The car was not straight, the police van was not straight because of this stone that was underneath.  I noticed that and I got out of the car and I started firing.  I opened the door of the car and I took this 9 mm parabellum, the one that was from the policemen and I took that ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, you're going too fast.  This motor vehicle the police was driving in, what was it, a van or a car or what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> It was a van.</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, carry on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> When I got into that van I opened the door, I took this 9 mm parabellum.  After taking this firearm and we searched these people because we thought it's either they were dead or they were injured.</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was this police van overturned somewhat?</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> It was slightly - it had slanted because of the stone, the big stone that was underneath.</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And then when you opened the door there how many occupants did you find?</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> I saw two policemen, two policemen were in that car.</p>

<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> We took two pistols, a 9 mm pistol ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You took it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> I took one 9 mm, the one that was lying on top of the policeman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And who took the other firearm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> I cannot remember about the second one but after doing that we ran away, we did not go back to the car and we went to a wall or fence and we jumped over that and we threw the firearms on the other side.</p>

<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> We threw the firearms on the other side.</p>

<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What do you mean by throwing the firearms the other side?</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> On the direction that we were running to, it was a yard, I think it was a yard, there was a garage inside and there was this high wall and it was very difficult for us to jump this wall having firearms therefore we decided to throw them on the other side and then we jumped after that.  I remember very well that the pistol was with me and I threw that pistol over the wall and after that we picked them up after jumping this high wall and we picked them up and we ran again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> With the firearms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> We were running away with the firearms that were with us when we got into the car and the other two firearms that we got in that police van.</p>

<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> As I was explaining that we were approaching this cross-roads junction.  There was a barrage of bullets from the direction of the cross-roads junction from a car that was on the other side, the one that I thought it was a police casspir and they were shooting towards our car therefore it was difficult for us to go back to our own car.  We ran and we jumped this high fence, high wall that I was talking about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What happened to those firearms that you took from the police van?</p>

<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> Ndota was the one the very first person that we made contact with when we came to the Ciskei.</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Look here, was he the president of Ciskei or what was he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> He was also an MK soldier.</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Based in the Eastern Cape in Mdantsane?</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> He was residing in the Eastern Cape at Alice.</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes and you never saw those two firearms again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And the first two pistols that were taken from the police station what happened to them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> We left them with Ndota also.</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I thought you told us you take those two to Cape Town to Dalasile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> The firearms that we took with to Cape Town were the sub-machine guns.  The four pistols belonging to the police were never taken to Cape Town, we left them with Ndota and we went to Cape Town with the sub-machine guns.</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What was Ndota's duties there in the Eastern Cape?</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> I had seen Ndota for the first time on that particular day and I did not know what his duties were in the Eastern Cape, I don't even know whether he was employed or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Anything more?</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> I am not sure but unless there is a question I am willing to answer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Nompozolo, at some stage before the case is closed we would like to know exactly what the applicant is applying for.</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.  On page 2, paragraph - I'm sorry, Section 9.4, he has applied for amnesty for a shoot out with Ciskei Police and South African Police raid on the police station.  Now on our paragraph 14 there, application for amnesty is for the possession of unlicensed firearm, attempted murder on the police at Frankfort, attempted murder on the police who were in the police van ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where was attempted murder at the Frankfort Police Station?</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> Because there is a policeman which is alleged to have been shot.  The one who they found on the police van and then they took him out to go and knock at the police station, then he was shot by Manobise.</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was he shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> He was shot by Manobise.</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How do we know that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> I think he said so Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He said he heard the shot outside and this is what he heard that Monabise had shot at a fleeing policeman.  Do we know whether the policeman was hit or in which direction was aimed at etc?  I'm asking, I'm not saying and I'm not forcing you to concede anything, I'm raising issues that come across in my mind.  Have we got evidence to that effect?</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> Well because he said, Monamise said "I have shot at this policeman, he was running away" then when somebody who has fired a shot at another person that is an attempted murder.</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is he guilty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> Of common purpose, yes Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> Because they left together, together with Monabise and others to go and do a raid at the police station and the eventuality of that, they must have foreseen that there could have been shooting taking place at the police station.</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Aikona.  Look at it this way.  They went to the police station armed, they must have foreseen that someone can get killed or injured by being shot with those firearms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That it is in order to facilitate the robbery or the taking of the firearms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you argue that they also must foreseen that in the event of a policeman running away which had nothing to do with the theft, that someone could get killed?  Is that part of the common purpose?</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> That's it, Mr Chairperson, the reason for that is as simple as this, it is not known where the policeman was running to.  To raise an alarm on others and all that which ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that the reason he was shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> Because well, we don't know the reason why he was shot ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well that's ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> But when Nomabise said he shot him because he was running away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, no, he said "I shot at him when he was running away."  Are we entitled to draw the inferences then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> I imagine that the inference that can be drawn, Mr Chairperson, is that because of the running away of the policeman and Nomabise trying to stop him then that's the eventuality of the matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How does this applicant become guilty of something that he did not even know about?  Never mind foreseeability, he was inside, he heard the shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> He left the policeman guarded by others outside who were part of his group.  We may withdraw that, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, no, you'd better consult.  I'm just asking the questions, I haven't made up my mind yet what to do.  I'm raising issues that are likely to become issues when we discuss the matter and I'd like the benefit of your argument on that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> Yes, actually Mr Chairperson, he himself when there was a resistance from this policeman they had a struggle and he himself managed to bring this policeman down on the ground.</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I know that.  I know that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> Now it cannot be said exactly what would happen in a situation where they were but the issue is that they all of them associated themselves with their acts and with what could have been the end result.</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I don't know, I can't - the Sharpeville Six case, what was the name of that case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> It was Sharpeville, it was Sefatsa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sefatsa.  Have you read that case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> I did, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It deals with common purpose.  There are certain guidelines in that case that explains how this common purpose works.  Now let's forget about in the past how the courts were interpreting that and how the convenient interpretations of it in the past.  Let's talk about today and how it should be interpreted.  Not for convenience but on a legal basis.  As I remember it, in order to be guilty on a crime based on common purpose, one must actively or psychically associate therewith, it's commission.  How do you say this applicant associated himself, he could not have associated himself physically because he was away from the incident.  So in order to be guilty based on common purpose he must have associated himself psychically.  How do you say that in this case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> Because in this case whilst they said that they don't want to shoot at this policeman but they said "please cooperate with us".  Now the running away of the policeman is part of non-co-operation with them and in that non-co-operation, Nomabise then shot the policeman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> On behalf of everybody?</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> On behalf of everybody because they wanted this policeman to cooperate with all of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But that was never envisaged by the applicant was it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> But it is a consequence of what he got himself into.</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You say he must have foreseen that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> He must have foreseen that somebody might have been killed there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In those circumstances, not of robbery but purely for running away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> There's an aspect here Mr Chairperson, maybe it has not been canvassed but that aspect is that he does not know when the firearm from the policeman outside was recovered.  Now there mission was to get firearms from the police station.  It may be that Nomabise was busy trying to get the firearm when the policeman ran away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So?</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> Which then makes him to be part of what Nomabise was doing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But he doesn't know that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> That's what I'm saying, he has only told the Commission that "I don't know where the second firearm, how the second firearm was recovered, all I know is that it was recovered.  I only recovered one firearm inside" and it does not even say at which stage was that firearm recovered.</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So how can we draw the inference that that was related to the running away?  Your own client doesn't know that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> He does know yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So how can we draw the inference and therefore bring the attempted murder under the veil of the applications?</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> The reason is that the attempted murder was part of the all encompassing mission they were in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was it?  Shooting at a policeman running away did not facilitate the robbery, it had nothing to do with the robbery, they were busy robbing already?  In fact they were close to finishing, isn't it?  He himself says when he got out he discovered a shot had been discharged and they all ran away?</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He went inside after that to continue with the ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just to collect the gun and go, that gun that was brought.</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> No, this running away because they even said to this policeman who was inside, "run away then" after they discovered that they could not find the key to the safe and take the firearms from the safe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay, so it may have been if you want us to speculate, it may have been an intention to rob and allow the policeman to run away, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well we can withdraw it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So see we're speculating but I'm not prepared to just dismiss the attempted murder without thinking about it and hearing what you've got to say.  We may except your argument, we may reject it, I'm not too sure what's going to happen but I don't want to go and discuss it and then think I never asked about that and I never asked about this.  Anyway, you say attempted murder?</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> Attempted murder on the police at Frankfort.</p>

<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, what about M I Tupi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> M I Tupi yes, inside the police station.</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Anything else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> Pointing of firearms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well isn't that part of the robbery?</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> Oh, yes it is.</p>

<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And then we talk Mdantsane?</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What we're going to do there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> Mdantsane, attempted murder.</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Two.</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> To the police.</p>

<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do we know whether anybody was injured there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> I think he said that ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He said he thought they looked dead, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> He said that they looked dead.</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> There's a difference between being dead and looking dead.</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> Well the inference is that they shot at the policemen and the policemen were injured.</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mapoma, do we know what the results of those investigations were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Unfortunately, Chairperson, we do not know became of that actual shooting.  Information of court and the victims that are available here are with regard to the Frankfort shooting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You see, Mr Nompozolo, we have come across instances where policemen roll over and play dead to avoid being shot, we never know.  But there must be an attempted murder because they shot at the police van, I assume expecting there could be a case but we don't know if there have been deaths and we don't know the identity of those people, do we?</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> No we don't.  We've ...(indistinct) the application, it just said "shoot out with Ciskei Police".</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, what else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> Because they shot at the van although there is no clear evidence, we have included malicious injury to property, that is on the police van.</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> Also the theft of firearms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well that was robbery.</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> I don't think they were robbed Mr Chairperson because they, the police tried to stop them and when they were shooting at the police their aim was not to rob them, the firearms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What was there then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> They were defending themselves because ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is defence a good case for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> No, hence I'm saying theft of firearms because when they saw that the police were looking like dead they took the firearms and they had no authority to take the firearms so it amounts to theft.</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So that attempted murder, those two attempted murders, are those crimes then if they were defending themselves?   They were not defending themselves, they shot themselves.</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> Nomabise started to shoot at the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes so it was an attack on the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> Yes so ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It's not defending?</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> Yes but they did not, they met the police by coincidence, they did not plan to go to those police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What about unlawful possession of firearms and ammunition there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> Yes, I was still coming to that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> That is all as far as this applicant is concerned Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR NOMPOZOLO</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mapoma, is there any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MAPOMA:</span> Yes Chairperson, there are a few questions that I've got.</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a>	Mr Mamani, are you Mamani or Memani, your surname?</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> Mamani.</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> M-A.</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Yes Chairperson, M-A-M-A-N-I.</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a>	When you went for the shootings, I mean for the operations in the Eastern Cape, where were you based?</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> We did not have a permanent place to stay.  I once stayed at Forte, I once stayed at Mdantsane, it was Forte and Mdantsane but I did not have a stable place of residence because we did not want to be traced.</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> I see.  So you were not subjected to the command structures of the MK in any particular region as such, is that what you're saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> That is not what I'm trying to say.  We did not have a place, a permanent place to stay for security reasons because we could only trust ourselves only because we knew that it was easy for a person who was not involved in the mission to turn against us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Let me put my question like this, you will remember that in the country the command structures inside the country of MK, there were command structures of the MK in the Eastern Cape, in the Ciskei, I mean border area then, in the Transkei area then, Western Cape and so on.  What I want to find out is which command structures were you reporting to as MK operatives then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> We would act per instruction from Chris Hani as the chief of staff, like we always tried to avoid to mix with the other structures because of financial problems so we did not want to involve ourselves in those structures, we had to be involved with our missions and complete them and go back to Cape Town and when we arrived in Cape Town we were summoned by the provisional command in Cape Town and he demanded the report and I made that report.</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Why was it the Cape Town command that demanded a report from you when the operation was in the Eastern Cape and in fact when you operated you were based in - you were coming from the Eastern Cape to operate.  You did not leave from Cape Town to come and operate here.  You were here and operated here and then ran to Cape Town and why was the report asked by the Western Cape command of the MK?</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> The comrades called me for the reasons not known to me, I don't know what was on their minds at the time, they called me and they wanted to know what had happened on the mission and I told them and all I knew was that one of them was in the command structure of the province, the Western Cape Province, at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Okay, now ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(inaudible) for Frankfort?</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> Will the speaker please repeat the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When those firearms were taken from the police station at Frankfort, to whom was it intended that those firearms would be handed to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> The aim was that us as the unit, we were supposed to take the firearms and train the people in Cape Town and ensure the protection of the unit with these same firearms.  The people who were involved in the mission at Frankfort Police Station.</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who told you that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> I am going to repeat this, Comrade Chris Hani said to us we should defend the people, try and acquire firearms to be able to protect the people, that is what we did.  We couldn't take the firearms and give them to the other structures because there were other structures that were existing already but our mission was to train and defend the people in that particular community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mamani, I'm asking you a simple question, you don't seem to understand it or you're not answering it properly.  How did you know you must take firearms to Cape Town?  You say you were supposed to hand those firearms back in Cape Town?</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> We were told by Comrade Chris Hani to get firearms and take them with to Cape Town.</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Alright, you were supposed to rob the Frankfort Police Station of firearms and take them to Cape Town, was that your order?</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> The order did not specify a place but we were told to get firearms and protect the people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No but Mr Mamani, and I'm not trying to catch you out but something concerns me.  When you first started to testify you told us that the Frankfort Police Station was reconnoitred and you people went to Chris Hani and told him this is the plan and he approved of it and that's what you needed and you proceeded to rob the police station of it's firearms or some of it's firearms, is that not true?</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> I cannot say that is not true but the judge misunderstood me, we did not first reconnoitre the place and went back to Chris Hani, we first got the instructions from Chris Hani to get firearms and defend the people and we decided that our easy targets would be the homelands, the homeland that we targeted was Ciskei as the structure what we decided upon but Chris Hani was not part of that decision, he did not tell us to go to Ciskei or go to a specific place but we sat down and planned and we talked more about our security and we had to select the places, we would ensure that our missions ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You never got a specific order with regard to Frankfort Police Station from Chris Hani?</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> No, we did not get a specific order but we are the people who selected the place, the reconnaissance is that we went there to that rural area as if we're going to Nomabise's place and we knew very well that we wanted to looked around this place because Nomabise told us that there was a police station in his neighbourhood.</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now where were you stationed in South Africa before this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> Before this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes before the incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> I was residing in Cape Town, Number 465, Dunn Street, New Cross-roads.</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How long before this incident at Frankfort did you come to the Eastern Cape?</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> When it was hardly a week here in the Eastern Cape.</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now where was Chris Hani at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> Chris Hani was with us in Cape Town before coming to the Eastern Cape.  The instruction was issued by Chris Hani while we were still in Cape Town with him.  We are the people who decided upon Ciskei as our target.</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you left Chris Hani there in Cape Town and came to commit this robbery?</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> Chris issued this instruction as he was a person who was travelling around to all the provinces with other missions of the ANC and he told us about this and after that he left for other places.</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you talking about 1992?</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> Yes I'm talking about 1992.</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But weren't you attached to the personal security system of Chris Hani?</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> As I did explain before I was working for the security of the African National Congress, the department of intelligence and security and we were also involved in body guarding.  He was my principal at the time when he was issuing the instructions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes Mr Mapoma?</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Now is it your evidence that Chris Hani gave you direct instructions to this effect?</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> Will you please repeat the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Is it your evidence that Chris Hani spoke to you directly instructing you that you must get the firearms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> Yes it was a direct instruction as he was referring to myself and the other comrades were there at the time,  though the other one was also involved in something else at home therefore only the two of us were left to go on the mission, it was myself and Comrade Nomabise, we recruited the other comrades and we went to this operation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> What rank did you occupy in the MK hierarchy at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> We did not have ranks in the MK like in any regular forces.  We would have section commanders, company commanders up to the very last structure in the army.  The rank was not important here in South Africa but in exile I was a base commander in one of the bases that we had in the exile.</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Yes.  Now the intended purpose was to arm the SDUs, is that the case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> Yes it was to train, to establish them and train them and arm them so that they can protect the community because we wouldn't be responsible for defending them or protecting them but we had to train them and show that they are doing this job of protecting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> In Cape Town?</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> In Cape Town, more especially the neighbouring townships because when Chris Hani was talking to us he mentioned those places because in my place of residence it was more like a stronghold of African National Congress so the apartheid regime would always attack this place in the '90s as it was also happening in the other areas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Mr Mamani, please, please answer the question.  Just answer the question.  If a question is simple, just give a simple answer, straightforward answer, please do that.  Now when you left Cape Town for an operation in the Eastern Cape you were intending to come and get firearms here to arm the SDUs in Cape Town, is that not the case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Now when you got the firearms from the Eastern Cape, none of those firearms were taken to Cape Town, is that not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> Those are the firearms that I'm talking about that we had given to Comrade Dalasile, all those firearms were from the Eastern Cape.</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> No, no, the firearms, all the pistols which were taken from the police were left in the Eastern Cape, you left with the machine guns and other big guns back to Cape Town.  All those that you kept, you took or robbed from the police stations were left with Ndota in the Eastern Cape, is that not your evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> This what happened, we looked at these firearms that we had acquired and we had to say yes all of firearms were needed in Cape Town because of the large number of people we decided to take the sub-machine guns and leave Ndota with the pistols because we had a belief that at least a pistol is not a firearm that is difficult to find.  The firearms that were scarce were only the sub-machine guns therefore we couldn't rely also on the pistols.  We decided to leave the pistols with Ndota and take the sub-machine guns with us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> But those sub-machine guns are the sub-machine guns which you left with from Cape Town, am I wrong?  When you left Cape Town, you were not armed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> No we were not armed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> So these, these ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why couldn't you just collect those firearms or sub-machine guns from Eastern Cape and go back to Cape Town?</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> It is because after getting all these firearms at that they also wanted the firearms because he wanted to establish the same structures as ours in the Eastern Cape therefore we decided to give him a start with the pistols and we told them that at least we were going to give him these pistols because they were not very scarce in his region.</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Now, okay let's leave that one.  Now let's come to Frankfort.  Is it your evidence that the only policeman who was shot there is the one who was outside, the one who ran away?</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> The policeman who was shot was the one who was outside, the one who was sleeping in the police van.</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> So when you were inside is it your evidence that you did not shoot the policeman who was inside?</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> The policeman who was inside was not shot and no one shot at this policeman but after kicking the door open, we shot in the house that is why the firearm was on the other side and the policeman was crying with his hands up on the other side of the room.</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> So are you saying this policeman just handed that firearm immediately when there was a shot fired inside?</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> I did not see his actions, how did he lose his firearm but I saw the firearm on the floor but I did not know how did that happen but I thought that because of the shock he threw the gun on the floor because at some stage this firearm was between his legs before this incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> So are you saying none of you grabbed the firearm from him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> No I do not remember anyone gripping this firearm, I remember that this 9 mm pistol was on the floor and he was on the other side crying and there was shooting outside and there was confusion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> When you got inside what firearm were you having, you personally?</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> I was armed with the Uzzi sub-machine gun.</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Is there anyone who was carrying a pistol?</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> No, no one was having a pistol.</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Tell me, when you went outside after you heard those shots, did you see this person who was supposedly running away?</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> I saw this policeman getting out of the van and we wrestled and I saw him lying down but I did not look at his face, I just saw this person who was lying down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> After the shots?</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And that's when you got the explanation that he was attempting to escape?</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> When I heard the gunshots outside, when I looked Nomabise told me that this person was running away that is why he was shooting at him because he was resisting and he was not co-operating.  I did not ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Then you saw this person lying on the ground?</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a>	Mr Mamani, the policeman who was inside the premises of the police station is here today and he has made a statement which is contained in pages 26 and 27 of the bundle of documents which have been paginated and I would like your comment here on what he says in his statement.  On page 26 in line number 11 if the Committee would bear with me, line number 11, he says there, I will read for you and I would like to have your comment:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a>"The one who had a pistol advanced towards me and as he reached me he tried to grab my pistol and I refused and we struggled over it until we got out of the charge office."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a>What is your comment to this, do you agree with what he says?</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> The policeman who was inside the charge office, his firearm was on the floor, I disagree with this statement.  When I got in I saw the firearm on the floor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> And Mr Matiso will say if he is called to testify that he was shot three times, one on the shoulder and on the thigh and then on the stomach during that day and he was severely injured and he had to be admitted in Cecilia Makhiwane Hospital.  He is the policeman who was inside whom you said was never injured.  What do you say to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> Maybe my memory is not serving me correctly but I am saying this and this is how I remember this incident.  The only policeman who was injured was the one who was outside in the police van.  The one who was inside was not hurt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> And Mr Mamani, he says, I want you to be aware of this, he says on that ground he is opposing your application because he says you are not making full disclosure to this Committee, he says you are not candid to this Committee, you are not telling this Committee that you shot him three times and he had to be admitted in Cecilia Makhiwane Hospital as a result of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> Is he saying that I am the one who shot at him, is that what he is saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Your company, it may be you as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you were inside you say, how many shots did you hear?</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> I cannot remember but it was more than once.</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Didn't you say in your evidence you heard a shot outside?</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> I heard a firearm, I heard a gunshot from the outside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You heard a gunshot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that what you remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> It was not only one shot though I cannot say for sure about how many times.</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Because you see I want to refer you to your statement that you sent to the TRC, it's found on page 10 and 11 of the record of the bundle where in the third paragraph you say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a>"Before we could even calm him we heard gunshots, about three of them."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a>It's about four lines from the bottom of the typed version.  It's about 10 lines down on page 11.  Do you remember you said so or do you dispute it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> I remember that, I'm the one who wrote that statement.  I've been saying I heard the gun firing about three times, I cannot say for sure as to how many times but it was more than once.  Three times or more, I'm not sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And that came from outside not inside?</p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> It was not from the inside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And it occurred when you were inside?</p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> What I remember is that I kicked the door open, the policeman was crying and his firearm was on the floor, that is when I heard the firing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes Mr Mapoma?</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Do you admit or deny that this policeman who was inside was shot and injured by your company?</p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> I only know the policeman who was outside was hurt, I only know about the policeman who was outside was hurt, I don't have any knowledge about the policeman who was inside.  I might be making a mistake about that but I don't know.  I only know about the policeman who was outside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And what mistake might you be making?</p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> If this person is saying that he was hurt and he was inside, I disagree with that, he was outside.  The only person who was injured was the person who was outside.  The people who went to the door were the two of us, myself and Muntsu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Please just get this correctly.  He is not saying he was shot whilst inside necessarily, what he says is that he is the policeman who was inside when you came there.  There were two policemen, one outside and one inside and he's the one who was inside and he was shot and injured in the scuffle that was going on.  Whether inside or outside he was shot three times.  Do you deny or admit that one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> I'm sorry, Chairperson, in all fairness to the applicant, it needs to be stated categorically where was this policeman shot because he is saying this policeman was never shot inside therefore it cannot be said that he was shot either inside or outside?</p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well I don't know if that matters much whether it was inside or outside, your client's version is that while he was busy there inside there was a policeman there and he heard this shot or shots outside and when he went there he saw this person lying down there, evidently injured or killed, so the crux of the issue here is whether the person claims to have been shot was the person that your client encountered inside the office or not or whether shot there was the person they encountered while sleeping in the police van.</p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson, my understanding is that there were shots which were fired whilst the applicant was inside and subsequent to that, the applicant and others were shooting randomly and that was inside then but now at that stage the policeman was not there.  Then it will be then unfair if he is expected to admit on a speculation whether it was inside or outside because he is saying inside he was never shot at whilst he was there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes but Mr Nompozolo, is there really an issue here?  This policeman doesn't say that your client injured him, shot him?  He's just simply saying that he was injured in this incident and the question is, is it possible, did your client actually deny that as a fact or is it possible, does he concede whether it's possible that this policeman was injured in this incident?  Is there really such a big issue here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> No, it's no issue then, if that is the case, no it's no issue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mamani, - yes, just have your water first.</p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a>	Mr Mapoma is saying that according to the policeman who was inside the charge office, he, that policeman, was also injured in this incident, he was wounded.  Now the question is what is your comment on that, is it possible, are you saying it's not true or what?  Well maybe we can make it easier for you, how many policemen were injured during that incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> A policeman was injured, only one policeman injured in this incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Only one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now which one was that as far as you're concerned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> The policeman who was sleeping in the car, that is what I think.</p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay.  When you went to investigate this shooting, this policeman that you encountered in the police station, was he still in the police station?</p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> I am not certain about that because of the way you put it.  To me it looked like there was no one inside but what is confusing me is the fact that we found the firearm inside and there was a person inside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes now when you heard the shots outside you went to look, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> I just peeped outside and I heard Nomabise talking.  I went back again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now when you peeped outside, the policeman you found in the police station, he was still in the police station not so?  That's how I understand your evidence, he had not left the police station when you peeped out or by the time you had peeped out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> I remember seeing this policeman crying and the firearm was on the floor.  Surely he was still inside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes and when you peeped you saw the other one who you thought was injured lying on the ground there.  Nomabise saying he was trying to escape?</p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So clearly if Nomabise had shot at that person and injured him it was the person who was lying outside when you peeped outside of the police station, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you say there was only one policeman injured in that whole incident from the time you came to the time you left?</p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So it could not have been the person you encountered in the police station first, the person who was crying and whose pistol who was lying on the floor?  He could not have been injured, it wasn't him that was injured in that incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> Yes it's like that because when I peeped outside I saw a person lying down and this other policeman was still inside the charge office so it was impossible that the person inside was the one who was injured.</p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> By anybody?  Because you told this policeman to run away, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now what that policeman will come say if he comes to testify but it's been put to you on the policeman's behalf, is that what you are telling us is not quite true because he was the person, he claims at this stage, he hasn't testified yet, he is claiming that he was the person inside you encountered, most probably crying there and his pistol was on the floor, who was injured during that incident, three times.  What do you say about that?  On version he must not be telling us the truth then?  Or he will not come tell us the truth if he does come testify that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> I am not in a position to say a person is lying or telling the truth but what I'm sure about, the fact that I'm telling the truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Come Mr Mamani, yes, then he is not telling us the truth if he comes to tell us that.  The situation can only be one way, it can't be both ways, can it?  Not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes Mr Mapoma?</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE POTGIETER:</span> Just a minute.  Mr Mamani, what did you mean, you told us earlier that you might be mistaken.  Now what did you mean by that?  What might you be mistaken about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> If ever a policeman says that the police who sustained injuries was the one who was inside and I'm saying that the policeman who sustained injuries was outside.  First of all I am here to ask for forgiveness.  I do not want to find myself opposing the procedures.</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You can come to that, I'm going to give you an opportunity to say all those things just now.  What Mr Potgieter has asked you to explain is about 15 minutes ago you said well you might be mistaken about something and none of us understood what you meant by being mistaken.  I did ask you the question and you didn't deal with it.  What might you be mistaken about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> Perhaps I am mistaken about the policeman who was injured and the other thing that I would like to request the  Commission to take note of is the fact that at the time some things were not planned, they just happened, but when you sit down and try to remember what happened, it comes as I'm relating it to the Commission right now.  Maybe I'm making a mistake as to which policeman was injured between the two.</p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> So if I understand you well, are you saying this policeman who says he was injured, he might well have been injured during that incident, is that what you're saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> He got injured during the raid at the police station at Frankfort, yes I agree with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Thank you Chairperson, no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MAPOMA</p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Any re-examination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a><span class="speaker">RE-EXAMINATION BY MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> Yes, thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a>	Now you have told the Commission that you came to the Ciskei without firearms.  Do you know where the sub-machine guns were coming from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> I was told where they were from.  I know.  the sub-machine guns - a day after our arrival there were sub-machine guns.  On my first night I spent at Fort Hare with the comrades that I came from in Exile.  When I met my comrades the following day they told me that there were arms available, we'll go to the police station the following day.  We got seven sub-machine guns.</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> Now you have also said that you were part of the bodyguards guarding Chris Hani.  Were these bodyguards national bodyguards or were they provincial?</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> I was in the provincial level at the Western Cape.</p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> So when would you meet Chris Hani, would you meet Chris Hani when he has visited your province or whenever you want to meet him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> I didn't meet him whenever I wanted to but only when he was visiting our province.  I would be guarding him or if I was busy on duty guarding another leader, somebody else would guard him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> You went to Frankfort Police Station to rob or to fetch firearms.  Did you know what kind of firearms you were going to get there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> No, we did not know what kind of firearms we were going to get there but one thing that we knew certainly was that there would be sub-machine guns in the police stations and pistols as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> Now there at Frankfort, after you have checked and saw that one policeman was shot at and then you got inside again, now what happened to the policeman who was inside the police station at the charge office?</p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> When he went out of the door of the charge office, I do not know what happened, when did it happen but I was with him inside although we did not stay inside for long but when we got outside I advised him to run away, he would not be killed but he did not trust that but he insisted that he is on duty, he doesn't want to go away but I advised him to go away but there was this constant firing that was happening.  He went away and we also went on foot, we ran away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> So did he leave before you inside the police station or you went out of the police station together?</p>
<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> As I have mentioned, I do not remember who went out first but I remember clearly telling him to run away, I told him to disappear and he did that and we were firing in the air and we also ran away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> Now when he ran away, was it dark outside or was there a light which was providing you to be able to see what was happening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> It was dark.</p>
<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> When you got out of the police station were there shots still fired outside?  Now you got out of the charge office, now you are inside the yard but outside the charge office, were there shots still being fired by whoever?</p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> Yes there was still constant firing.  It was noisy at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> Thank you Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR NOMPOZOLO</p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIBANYONI:</span> Mr Mamani, what is your MK name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> I was called Chocho.  C-H-O-C-H-O, Chocho Sekola, S-E-K-O-L-A.</p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIBANYONI:</span> Now the instruction to acquire firearms or weapons from Chris Hani, was it directed to you or was it directed to you commanders?</p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> Chris was talking to me personally on that day because I was accompanying him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIBANYONI:</span> Isn't it so that ANC had a supply of firearms from outside?</p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> That is true, ANC had it's ammunition, armoury supply from outside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIBANYONI:</span> You are saying that despite that you were requested to also acquire firearms on the ground level?</p>
<p class="line" id="line546"><a name="pos546"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> Firstly, the armoury that was inside the country were being used by the units that were existent that as I have mentioned that I came back after indemnity in 1991, I didn't come back with any armoury from outside the country.  Whatever supply was there it belonged to certain units.</p>
<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIBANYONI:</span> This incident happened in 1991, March 1991, was there still problems in the Eastern Cape more specially around Frankfort?</p>
<p class="line" id="line548"><a name="pos548"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> What problems are you referring to sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIBANYONI:</span> Problems which necessitated you people to acquire firearms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIBANYONI:</span> What were those problems?</p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> These problems were not only pertaining in the Western Cape or in the Eastern Cape where we got the weapons, they were country wide.  Raids that were State financed, that were perhaps emerging from Pretoria that were perpetrated by third force elements forced the need to ensure the protection of the communities or else to make sure that those attacks do not happen again and we were the only ones, the soldiers of uMkhonto weSizwe who could or rather who were told to play the role of defending the communities against the raids.</p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIBANYONI:</span> Now were there formal structures of SDUs at Mdantsane where you were staying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> I never met any SDUs in Mdantsane but where we were staying at the Section 7 the people that we met there knew that we were armed but they did not know as to what purpose but they knew that we ANC members and they were ANC members as well but we never supplied them with any details.</p>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIBANYONI:</span> By the way, who did you give the firearms to in Cape Town, what's the name of the person again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> It's Comrade Dalasile.</p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIBANYONI:</span> Did he participate in any formal structure of SDU?</p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> Yes he was a guerrilla that was trained inside the country and he also had close connection with the SDUs and thus we used him as the one who would keep the weapons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIBANYONI:</span> The policeman who was inside the police station at the charge office, was it possible he was injured after you had instructed him to run away?</p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> I do not think that that is possible because I guaranteed that he can run away, he won't get hurt, seeing that the safe can't be opened he can just run away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIBANYONI:</span> As you were running away, you were firing in the air.  How many of you were firing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> I cannot be sure about that but I shot as well in the air in the direction of the gate, running towards the gate but I believe that all of us were shooting at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In which direction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> We were running towards the gate and shooting in the air.</p>
<p class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> All of you shooting in the air?</p>
<p class="line" id="line566"><a name="pos566"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> The firearm that was in my possession was facing upward and I was shooting in the air and I saw my companions doing the same, there was no target in front of us but it was just a gate that we were running towards.  We were shooting to show that we had won the battle, we found at least what we had come there for, our mission was accomplished which was coming to take the firearms of which we got.</p>
<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIBANYONI:</span> All your companions were just around you and you were aware that none of them was busy shooting the policeman who was inside the charge office when you were retreating?</p>
<p class="line" id="line568"><a name="pos568"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> That I did not notice.</p>
<p class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIBANYONI:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson, no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line570"><a name="pos570"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mamani, I just want to ask one question, that statement that you made on page 10 and 11 of the record, the typed version is on page 8 and 9.  Is it true that you wrote this statement on the 16th October 1999?  On page 10 and 11 or 12?</p>
<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> Yes I wrote it then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And the contents of that statement is what you believe to be the true version?</p>
<p class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAMANI:</span> Yes I do, it was the absolute truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you, that's all.  Are there any other witnesses that he'd like to call on his behalf?</p>
<p class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> Thank you, no other witnesses, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Chairperson, I may need the direction of the Committee on this.  I thought I would call Mr - just bear with me Chairperson?  I thought I would call Mr Zamile Matiso who was injured but in the light of it not being an issue as to whether he was injured or not, none of the applicants seems to concede that he may have been injured.  I do not think it would be necessary for me call unless the Committee may require his evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well let us take the lunch break and I want to think about that, I don't want to mislead you or whatever.  Let me think about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Yes Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I'll tell you during the course of lunch break.</p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Yes, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We're adjourned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mapoma, your enquiry for which you sought guidance, was that intended to find out whether we are willing to grant one of the policemen victim status?</p>
<p class="line" id="line585"><a name="pos585"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Well not necessarily Chairperson, I just thought that it's almost common cause that he was injured.  I thought that perhaps the Committee may want his version perhaps.</p>
<p class="line" id="line586"><a name="pos586"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I don't know, that I must leave in your hands whether you want to put that version.</p>
<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line588"><a name="pos588"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If it is to - if it was for the purpose of whether you wanted to know if we're going to declare him a victim, in that case yes we would consider him a victim.</p>
<p class="line" id="line589"><a name="pos589"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Yes that was mainly, that was my feeling as well, Chairperson, that he ought to be considered as a victim and then on the merits which is my view, Chairperson, that his version will not take the matter any further.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Have you got any other witnesses?</p>
<p class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> I have no other witness Chairperson, I'm not calling him then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Have you got any submissions to make?</p>
<p class="line" id="line593"><a name="pos593"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> No Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line594"><a name="pos594"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you agree with Mr Nompozolo that in Frankfort issue, that the offences involved there would be attempted murder, possession of, unlawful possession of firearms and ammunition, robbery of two firearms and ammunition, malicious injury to property and pointing a firearm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> I agree Chairperson with those offences except for the offence of attempted murder.  He seems to qualify it to a specific policeman.  I would say it must be an attempted murder to whoever might have been injured there or might have been shot at there being a policeman, not necessarily the policeman whom this guy positively says was shot at in the light of ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line596"><a name="pos596"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you know how many policemen were injured?</p>
<p class="line" id="line597"><a name="pos597"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> From our investigation there is one policeman who was injured, in fact it was the policeman Mr Matiso who was inside and the one who was outside was - he escaped unhurt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line598"><a name="pos598"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line599"><a name="pos599"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Thank you sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line600"><a name="pos600"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And in the Mdantsane incident, two counts of attempted murder, theft of two firearms and ammunition, malicious injury to property and unlawful possession of firearms and ammunition.</p>
<p class="line" id="line601"><a name="pos601"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Yes I agree with that, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line602"><a name="pos602"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MAPOMA</p>
<p class="line" id="line603"><a name="pos603"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Nompozolo, we don't want to hear any argument.  We will reserve judgment on this matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line604"><a name="pos604"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What's your next matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line605"><a name="pos605"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> My next matter is Xolisa Mkonwana</p>
<p class="line" id="line606"><a name="pos606"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMPOZOLO:</span> Sorry Mr Chairperson, may he be excused then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line607"><a name="pos607"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
