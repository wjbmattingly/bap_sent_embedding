            "Yes, I'm prepared to do so.  When I came from Mdantsane on stand-by we went to Bisho 165 Battalion.  When we arrived there at 1 Ciskei Battalion we were given our salaries and we were given one day off.  That meant that we were supposed to come back the following day.\n\tIn the morning the following day I was still sleeping with my girlfriend.  I woke up and I prepared myself because I knew very well that on that particular  day I was supposed to wake up and go back to work.  I think it was, the time was between 3 o'clock and 4 o'clock but I woke up before lighting my lamp in the house.  \n\tWhen I was still relaxing there on my bed I realised that something was happening, something that sounded like a big stone hitting the window.  I took my girlfriend, we took cover with my girlfriend.  We sat down next to the bed.  She cried and asked me what was happening.  I tried to close her mouth with my hand because I wanted her to keep quiet.  And I whispered in her ear and I told her that people are coming to attack us.  \n\tWhen I looked through the window I realised that the lace curtain was actually moving because of the wind.  I saw someone who was lighting a match outside the window.  When I took a closer look, the first matchstick did not light and the petrol bomb did not explode inside the house, the one that the person was throwing.  And then the person decided to use the match to light the fire and I realised the person who was doing this was my own neighbour.  And my girlfriend, the one that was with me cried and she ran away, or not my girlfriend but my neighbour ran away.  \n\tI went to the door and I opened the door quietly and I went out and I took my girlfriend to my sister, to my sister's child who was with my sister and told them to stay with her.  I left quickly to the house, to my family house to ask for a telephone.  When I picked up the phone I realised that the phone was also out of order but I knew that a day before the phone was working.  \n\tI asked my sister to borrow me a torch and I checked the telephone line outside and I discovered that it was disconnected.  After that I left, I went to one of my colleagues who was also there in the area and I asked for assistance.  The assistance that I asked for was a pistol.  He did not want to give me this pistol. I left him and I went to my home.  \n\tWhen I arrived there I told my mother that I was going to Bisho to fetch my firearm.  I did that, I went to Bisho.  I went straight to my bungalow and I opened my locker.  I took out my firearm.  I went to King William's Town.  From King William's Town I went to Peddie in town and I left.  \n\tFrom there I went to the village where I was staying.  Unfortunately I saw the deceased staying with h is grandfather and I told him that I wanted to ask something from him.  He enquired about what I was prepared to tell him about.  And I told him that it was a long story, therefore we had to take a walk and get out of the yard.  We did so.  I asked the deceased why did he want to destroy me and my home, what was the reason and he said to me he did not do that, he denied.\n\tAfter that I told him that: \"You can't talk like that because last night you were there at my place.  You were there to attack me and now this is my turn and it's my turn to attack you.\"  I did so, I attacked him.  He died.",

He obviously believed and he had reasonable grounds to believe that he was in a volatile situation at the time.  I do believe that he's made full disclosure.\n\tThe Judgment of the High Court found that there had in actual fact been a petrol bomb attack at his house.  There was evidence to that effect and I do believe that he has made a full disclosure to this Committee about what he did, that he shot the deceased several, many times, I think several isn't enough, many times and for the bona fide reason that he believed that he was at threat.
