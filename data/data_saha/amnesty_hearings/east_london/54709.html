<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MALL:</span> Mr Brink, are we ready to proceed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a>	Mr Chairman the first application is that of K E Thoba, W Thompson, J W Makom.   They are asking for amnesty in respect of various accounts of assault and crimen injuria.  They are present but I think they should be seated at the applicants' table.  They are represented by Mr Hole, who is a local attorney.   </p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a>   	I understand that the applicants are Mr Thoba, sitting at the right hand side of the table which is virtually on your left, Mr Thompson is in the middle and Mr Makom is on the left hand side of the table.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a>	Mr Chairman in regard to the victims, I understand that Mr Simandla is present, he is one of the victims and also Ms Msutwana.   There are two other victims, Ms Maqana and Ms Nomoy, who were involved in various incidents.   All efforts to trace these two people have been unsuccessful and therefore they are not here today.  Mr Hole might like to proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MALL:</span> Yes Mr Hole.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLE:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a>	May I ask, before I begin the case for the first applicant</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a>Mr Chairman to request to make a few amendments to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a>application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MALL:</span> Certainly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a>EAST LONDON HEARING	AMNESTY/E CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a>MR HOLE	2	ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLE:</span> In respect of the first applicant, Mr K E Thoba, I wish to ask for an amendment to include a further victim, namely Ms N Maqoma. The Committee will recall that he made application only in respect of three victims.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MALL:</span> Would you spell the name of that victim please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLE:</span> It is spelt M-A-Q-O-M-A Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Was she the victim in respect of the trial that was heard at Alice?   The second victim there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MALL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLE:</span> In respect of the second applicant, Mr Thompson I wish to amend his application by adding a further victim, namely Ms N Maqoma.  She is the same person that has been referred to in the previous amendment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a>	And in respect of the third applicant, Mr J W Makom, I wish to make application to amend and include application for immunity in respect of the assault and torture of Miss N Msuthwana.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a>	Mr Chairman the reason for this late amendment is that in respect of Mr Thoba he was acquitted in respect of the assault on Miss Maqoma, and on further discussions we had agreed that we should ask the Committee for amnesty in respect of that assault as well, although he was acquitted in respect thereof.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a>	In respect of Mr Thompson the same applies, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a>	In respect of Mr Makom he was not even charged with the assault on Ms Msuthwana, but he does wish to lay himself open to this Commission and ask for amnesty in respect of that one as well.   Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MALL:</span> Are the applicants going to give evidence in Xhosa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLE:</span> Mr Chairman I have discussed this with them and Mr</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a>Brink next to me and to facilitate matters I propose to read.  I have I made their statements in the form of affidavits which are available for the Commissioners as well.  I propose to read EAST LONDON HEARING	AMNESTY/E CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a>MR HOLE	3	MR THOBA</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a>them for them and they are available to answer in Xhosa, whatever questions the Commission might want to put to them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MALL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Are you proposing to start with Mr Thoba, Mr Hole?</p>

<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLE:</span> I have before me statements prepared by these applicants.   Mr Chairman, I beg leave to hand them up to the Commission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MALL:</span> Yes, you may hand them in.   For convenience, we will identify these documents as follows</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a>The sworn statement by Mr Thoba to be Exhibit A;</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a>	by Mr Thompson to be Exhibit B;  </p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a>	and the one by Mr Makom as Exhibit C.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLE:</span> May I proceed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MALL:</span> Yes please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLE:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a>	This is the statement prepared in support of an application by the first applicant, Mr Kwanale Enoch Thoba.  It is in the form of an affidavit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a>	Mr Chairman it reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a>"The facts deposed to hereunder are within my personal knowledge unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a>	indicates."</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a>Then he recounts his personal circumstances.   He says:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a>"I am 45 years old and married.  I have three children, the eldest whom is doing standard seven.  My last born is still too young to go to school.</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a>	I have been a member of the Police Force since the 6th of </p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a>EAST LONDON HEARING	AMNESTY/E CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a>MR HOLE	4	MR THOBA</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a>June 1979.   I attended training at the Police College Hammanskraal for six months and was on graduation attached to the Uniform Branch of the Ciskei Police.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a>After a number of years in the Uniform Branch I was transferred to the CID where I also worked for a number of years until I was transferred to the Elite Unit of the Ciskei Police.  This is where I served until the military coup of March, 1990.</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a>	The offences of which I was convicted and in respect of which I now seek amnesty were committed whilst attached to this unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a>	During 1992 I was arrested and sentenced in separate cases for crimes involving assaults on political detainees.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a>	I am now serving a period of ten years imprisonment for these offences.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a>	Although the offences I have made myself guilty of did not include murder of persons, as has happened in security related cases throughout the country, they are nonetheless very serious ones and for which I wish to express remorse and if possible ask forgiveness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a>	I have been involved in assaults and torture of political prisoners in circumstances where wisdom and good sense should have told me to act otherwise.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a>	In order to understand why deeds like these were possible to perform perhaps one should look at the history of this region to be able to place things and understand them in proper perspective."   </p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a>Then he deals with the independence of the national states and the relations between the Ciskei and the Transkei.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a>"As part of the wider scheme of apartheid Transkei became independent in 1976.  Ciskei was to follow in December 1981</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a>EAST LONDON HEARING	AMNESTY/E CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a>MR HOLE	5	MR THOBA</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a>under the leadership of President Sebe.  From the onset Transkei was unhappy about Ciskei being given "independence".   Transkei felt that Ciskei should be given to Transkei to realise their dream of a great Xhosa nation.  These attitudes strained the relations between the states and these strained relations had far reaching consequences and have a bearing on the case before this Committee."</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a>It goes on to deal with the Ciskei state Mr Chairman.  He says,</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a>"The Ciskei state was a creation of apartheid.  To qualify as a country it had to have a population over which it held sovereignty.  To achieve this masses of people were displaced and forcibly removed from the so-called black spots and removed to Ciskei.</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a>	Those who could not be moved to Ciskei by promises of a land of milk and honey were moved by the Military and placed in Ciskei.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a>	A Secretary for Black Administration and Development wrote in Circular No 25 of 1967:  </p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a>'It is accepted Government policy that the Bantu are only temporarily resident in the area of the Republic for as long as they offer their labour there.  As soon</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a>		as they become no longer fit in the labour market they are expected to return to their country of origin or the territory of the national unit where they fit.   No stone should be left unturned to achieve this settlement in the homelands of non-productive Bantu.'</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a>This is a quotation from a book by Brian Lapink, entitled "Apartheid, A History."</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a>	A priest, Cosmos Desmond, reported of a group that was forcibly removed and settled in Natal.  He is quoted: </p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a>"We found the first arrivals sitting in the bare veld,</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a>EAST LONDON HEARING	AMNESTY/E CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a>MR HOLE	6	MR THOBA</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a>surrounded by their belongings, looking bewildered and utterly lost.   A little distance away was a water tank and a pile of folded tents, which the people did no know how to erect.  Nothing else."</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a>This is also a quotation from the same work.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a>"The scene painted by Father Desmond is true of many cases in Ciskei, especially in Dimbaza.   This was the kind of people His Excellency President for Life, Lennox Sebe, was presiding over.   Poor displaced and angry people.</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a>		The Police were caught in this trap especially those falling into the Security Police category.  It was only a question of time before more and more brutality was to be unleashed to subdue the brave ones who spoke out against the injustice."</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a>	Then dealing with the Sebe family Mr Commissioner, Mr Chairman:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a>"If the Ciskei Government was discredited for being an apartheid structure to enforce human suffering it was</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a>		no less discredited for being an institution of upliftment and enrichment of the Sebe family and those close to them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a>		Lennox Sebe was the Head of State.  His other brother was Minister of Transport.   The other brother was a Commander General of the combined forces, commanding and holding power over the following:  the Army, the Police, the Prisons, the Special Forces, the Traffic Police.  He was the most powerful person in Ciskei.  He was consulted about and authorised all detentions, under Proclamation R252, and later under the National Security Act of 1982."</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a>EAST LONDON HEARING	AMNESTY/E CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a>MR HOLE	7	MR THOBA</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a>	The Committee is at this stage referred to a judgment by His Lordship Mr Justice Pickard in a case of the STATE v SEBE, the reference is quoted in the statement.   The judgment, Mr Chairman, is quoted at length and begins at page 16 of their representations.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a>"The sons of Namba and Charles Sebe held ranks in the armed forces as well.  It was indeed a Sebe state. During a state function held at the national shrine an unscheduled speaker rose from the ranks of the audience and advanced to the podium and made a speech based on the Scriptures.   He prophesied that in the future Charles Sebe would be powerful, even more powerful than the President.</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a>		The immediate result of this is that the President became fearful of his own brother and proceeded to strip him of his powers.   </p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a>		He sidelined him in matters of state and the</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a>		President's security.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a>		In turn Charles Sebe became afraid of the wrath of the President.  He feared being detained as he had fallen out of favour."  </p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a>	Again the Commission is referred to a judgment by Judge Pickard at specifically page 626.  This is Annexure A of the representations, Mr Chairman.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a>"Fear rose in the senior ranks of the police about their possible detentions.</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a>		The events following the demotion of Mr Charles Sebe were as follows:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a>A.	Brig Tamsanqa who had served as Charles Sebe's Deputy, was detained.</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a>		B.	Senior Officers, including Charles Sebe gathered </p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a>EAST LONDON HEARING	AMNESTY/E CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a>MR HOLE	8	MR THOBA</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a>around and discussed and questioned the legality of the detention.  Suggestions of releasing Tamsanqa by force were made.</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a>		C.	Charles Sebe was detained and charged with terrorism.  He was sentenced to 12 years' imprisonment by the Bisho Supreme Court.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a>Again the Committee is referred to Annexure A which is the judgment of Justice Pickard and Annexure B which is an article quoted from the Daily Despatch, entitled 'Charles Sebe Trial Date set at Bisho.   Annexure C, Gen Minnaar was also detained.'</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a>	I am instructed, Mr Chairman, that Gen Minnaar was the side-kick of Gen Sebe.  	Also the Committee is referred to Annexure D which is an article by the Daily Despatch with the heading 'Sebe Jailed for Twelve Years'.    </p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a>"Soon after the arrest of Charles Sebe his brother, Namba, was also arrested on corruption charges.  His son Kamba, was arrested and detained by the Police.  Mr Namba Sebe sued the Commissioner of Police for arrest and detention.</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a>		The Government requested further particulars to the particulars of claim.  When he could not supply these the claim was dismissed with costs."</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a>	The Committee is referred to Annexure E which is the combined summons by Mr Namba Sebe, suing for his son and Annexure F which is the Order of the Supreme Court of Ciskei which dismissed his action with costs.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a>"Charles Sebe was to meet with a similar fate.  He sued for arrear salaries.  The Government defended the action and asked for further particulars, asking inter alia when and by whom he had been employed as a Major General in the Police Force.</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a>EAST LONDON HEARING	AMNESTY/E CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a>MR HOLE	9	MR THOBA</p>

<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a>	Reference is made to Annexure G which is the combined summons, and Annexure H which is the Order of Court, dismissing his action with costs.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a>"To the legal practitioner this might appear to be  a run of the mill procedure in civil litigation.  To us in the Security Forces this was a clear message that the President meant business.  If he could do these things to his flesh and blood ....."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a>	Mr Commissioner I think there is a mistake here, but I will proceed.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a>"A further factor was that the wives of his imprisoned and exiled brothers were evicted from their homes.  This was believed to be at the instance of the President or he allowed it to happen."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a>	Mr Chairman, the Committee is again referred to Annexure I, which is an article by the Daily Despatch at the time, reporting on the eviction of Mrs Namba Sebe and Mrs Charles Sebe from their homes, which was in Tjajo in Ciskei.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a>"Namba Sebe jumped bail and sought refuge in Transkei.  Namba and Charles Sebe were tried and convicted of terrorism and sentenced to long terms of imprisonment for terrorism.  "</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a>This is Namba and Charles Sebe's sons Mr Commissioner.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a>"On the 26th of September 1985 a group of White men raided the maximum security prison in Middeldrift and freed Charles Sebe.  This was the worst nightmare of his former juniors, who had whilst he had lost power, acted against him.  Charles Sebe was reputedly powerful and influential. It was not known what he</blockquote>

<blockquote class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a>would do when he was set free.</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a>		Those who betrayed him had a lot to fear in the line of retribution.   Pressure was put on the juniors to find him."</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a>	Mr Chairman, the Committee is referred to Annexure J which is also an article by a local newspaper, reporting on the armed and violent skipping of Mr Charles Sebe from jail.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a>"On the same day of the escape of Charles Sebe from prison the son of the President and the Commander of the Elite Unit of which we were members Major General</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a>		Kwane Sebe and his Deputy Colonel Zandasile Waya were abducted. They were drugged and transported to Transkei in the boot of a motor vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a>		The pair had been abducted from the Amatola Hotel in Bisho where Charles Sebe was seen shortly after his escape.  It was feared that they were in his hands.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a>		What became clear to the Security Forces was that we were dealing with not only with Charles Sebe but also his allies who were sophisticated and capable of out manoeuvering us. </p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a>		There was a state of panic, and pressure was being put on the Security Forces and the Elite Unit in particular to find the President's son alive.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a>		Soon after the abduction of the two it was learnt through Intelligence reports that they were kept hostage by the President's brother, Mr Namba Sebe."</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a>	The Committee, Mr Chairman, is referred to Annexure K, which is an article by a local newspaper, reporting on the abduction and the claim made by Mr Namba Sebe that he was keeping these two hostage.</p>

<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a>		These were most dangerous times in Ciskei.  Days of intrigue and subterfuge.	</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a>		They were made even worse by the apparent free hand</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a>		the Ciskei state gave to the insurgents ...(indistinct).</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a>		Soon after the escape of Charles Sebe reports were received that he had joined an organisation, called Illisolomzi, formed by Ben Nomoy and Lent Maqoma, the latter a former member of the parliament in Ciskei.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a>		Reports of a guerilla unit under training were received.   The Ciskei Government Intelligence fraternity sent W O Sidney Magauwli to infiltrate Illisolomzi.  He sent home reports of the training, personnel and plans of Illisolomzi.   What was most disturbing about the reports was that the armed units were trained by and with the assistance of the Transkei Defence Force.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a>		Pamphlets were distributed in Ciskei by Illisolomzi.  One of the pamphlets confirmed that Charles Sebe had become a member of this movement."</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a>	The Committee is now referred to Annexure L, which is an article by a local newspaper, reporting on the conviction of the sons of Mr Namba and Charles Sebe for terrorism. </p>

<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a>		the abduction of the Officer Commanding and his Deputy, instructed people to question Brig Simandla.</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a>		The people instructed to do so were myself,( that is Mr Thoba, Mr Chairman), W/O Bojana, Lt Thompson.   We proceeded to Tanaga Police Station where Brig Simandla was held and proceeded to question him.   During this questioning no assaults were committed nor was the Brigadier manhandled in any manner.</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a>		Having completed the interrogation we proceeded to Col Panzi to brief him.   The summary of our report was that the prisoner was denying all participation in the escape of Charles Sebe.   </p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a>		Brig Simandla admitted that no guard was placed at the tower post but said this was because the toilet at the base of the tower was out of order.</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a>		Lt Thompson, who had been the head of the interrogation, told us that he had been commanded to conduct another interrogation of Brig Simandla.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a>		The following day we proceeded from our Bisho offices to Thamaka Police Station to conduct the interrogation.  I noticed during interrogation that aside from Lt Thompson, Makom, myself and W/O Bojala, there were also other members of the Security Police from Mdantsane.   They also took part in the interrogation.   Again Brig Simandla gave us the same replies that he had given the previous day.</p>

<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a>		We had known even before commencing this interrogation that we were to put pressure on the Brigadier to answer our questions.   This had been talked about amongst us as being the orders from Col Panzi, to get the truth by assaults from the Brigadier, if needs be.</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a>		When it became apparent that we were not getting any admissions the Brigadier was ordered to undress.  Having undressed he was forced onto his stomach and suffocated with an inner tube of a motor vehicle.   Pressure was applied to the tube which caused him to suffocate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a>		Whilst this was happening other persons assisted in pressing him down and others held his feet and arms.  Other people even sat on his back.   This torture carried on for a while and people used to relieve each other and others would go out for fresh air or wash their faces.</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a>		The object of this was to make the Brigadier confess to having had a hand in the escape and possibly gave us leads to the plotters of the escape who might still be in Ciskei. </p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a>		During the torture Lt Funane and Thompson seemed to be in command of the operation.  A cigarette was also used to burn Brig Simandla on his body, in an effort </p>

<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a>		(2), a motor car inner tube was pulled around her face to cause her to suffocate;</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a>		(3), she was forced to lie on her back;  </p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a>		(4), a substance known as Sipapatxapa(?) was poured on her thighs and onto her vagina.  This caused an itching and irritating tract.  Burns resulted from this;</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a>		(5), when these things were done to her, some of us would press her down to overcome any resistance.  Others held her legs and others held and pressed her arms down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a>		The people with whom I did this were:  (i) Sgt Makwetu;  Iii) Sgt Mzimkulu;  (iii) Lt Thompson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a>		These things we did caused much pain and discomfort to Miss Msutwana.  She, however, was resolute in denying any participation in the deeds we questioned her about.  She provided no information resulting in the</p>

<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a>		After we had despaired and stopped the interrogation and torture, Col Panzi entered the interrogation room and asked if she had said anything.

<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a>		We decided to surround the house and knock.  Our knocks produced no results.   I decided to kick the door in.  We penetrated the house.

Therefore a person like me was very sad because I was very low in the ranks, that was my fear, I had to do things that I did not like.</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLE:</span> Yes. And what rank did Mr Ganda hold in the Ciskei Police at the time of his arrest if you can recall?</p>

<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">MR THOBA:</span> These captains who were torturing him got promoted in fact.   They were also taken to the court of law and were sentenced.  There was a presiding officer there, after he had sentenced them he lost his job but the captains were promoted.  They became majors.</p>

I was also trying to reflect repentance with the way I ill-treated him.  Mrs Msutwana, I wanted to greet her but I was too scared, because I feel ever so guilty for what I did.</p>

<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Yes please, Mr Chairman	Mr Thoba in your original application for amnesty and here I am referring, Mr Chairman, to paragraph 11(B) you indicated that the complainants with whom you were involved were detained following the orders of Col Panzi.  That is correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">MR THOBA:</span> Yes Sir, that is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Did the orders come directly to you from Col Panzi or did they come from one of your superiors who was below Col Panzi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MR THOBA:</span> These orders were from Col Panzi directly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> He gave no instructions to torture people, did he?</p>

<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">MR THOBA:</span> He said that I must visit the detainees.   And I must endeavour to get the truth from them.   If I did not get the truth I must beat them up.  The aim was to get the truth.</p>

<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">MR THOBA:</span> The way I tortured and ill-treated these women this is the way the police conducted themselves.  I found the situation as thus.  I just continued on the job as the others did.</p>

<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a>your statement.   Now it is correct, isn't that none of these victims made any confessions to you of subversive activities in the then Ciskei?</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">MR THOBA:</span> They never revealed anything.   Miss Msutwana and Brig Simandla did not admit to what I was asking them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Let's deal briefly with Miss Msutwana.  She was arrested or detained rather, on the 23rd of October 1986.  Do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MR THOBA:</span> Yes I do remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> On the same day she was appallingly treated by you and your colleagues.</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">MR THOBA:</span> Yes Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Notwithstanding that grossly inhuman behaviour on EAST LONDON HEARING	AMNESTY/E CAPE</p>

<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a>your part she admitted nothing.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">MR THOBA:</span> It is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> And she was then left without any medical attention for a period of five days until the 28th of October 1986, when she was seen by a doctor.   It is in the record.</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">MR THOBA:</span> The medical attention that she was meant to have was dependent on the Captain of that particular police station.</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> This woman was left alone for five days after the most savage, brutal and revolting assaults upon her and she had not made any confession whatsoever, please explain that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Did you have anything to do with her for those five days Mr Brink?</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Did you visit her during those five days?</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a>That was after the time the assaults ceased and until she received medical attention.</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">MR THOBA:</span> No, I did not have anything to do with her in those five days.</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Did you not think to see how she was getting on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">MR THOBA:</span> I was too scared to go, because I was going to be accused of working with her, collaborating with her.   The captain of the station was meant to look after her or after her needs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Did you tell the captain, we have treated this woman very badly, we have tortured her, we have got nothing from her, would you not go and see her and see whether or not she should see a doctor?</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">MR THOBA:</span> Yes, I did tell him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Now you say, or your evidence was to the effect that what you did to these women in particular, the treatment you gave Brig Simandla was bad enough, but the treatment you gave to these women in particular, you say, you did not do it willingly?</p>

<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> It seems to me from reading the record that you had the most, from your point of view, enjoyably sadistic time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">MR THOBA:</span> No Sir, it is not so.  As a man who was married it was painful to me, but it was because of the circumstances that we worked under.</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> You were laughing at these women.  You were laughing at them.   You only laugh if you are happy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">MR THOBA:</span> I did not laugh because I was happy at all.  You had to appear as if you were enjoying the job, so that it does not appear like you are working together with the victims.  It was painful.  It is painful to this day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Yes I can understand it is painful in retrospect.  You were a married man at the time.  Were you not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MR THOBA:</span> Yes I was married at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> And your colleagues were married men at the time.  Were they not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">MR THOBA:</span> Yes Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> And as married men did you not think women</p>

<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">MR THOBA:</span> Yes they had to be treated with respect.  If we had not been given the instructions that we must torture them, I do admit that they were ill-treated, but this is because of the instructions that we received.  We had to torture them.   Even though to us it was painful to do so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> So painful that you laughed at them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">MR THOBA:</span> I was not laughing.  I had to pretend that I was enjoying my job. If I had to sulk it would have repercussions.  Police would be detained just because you had a negative attitude.  This was under 2R52.  These are the painful</p>

<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Mr Thoba, you were given instructions to torture your subjects with a view of extracting information relating to the activities of Illisolomzi, is it not so?   And you were not given instructions to torture in order to gain more information about the nature of your victim's private parts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">MR THOBA:</span> It was one of the ways in which during torturing someone you would be just endeavouring to abstract the truth, so that when you give a report back to the person who gave  instructions you would go with a positive report.</p>

During the adjournment and following upon discussions with my colleague appearing for the applicants it has been agreed after consultation with the two victims present that there is no need for Mr Hole to read out the remaining applicants' affidavits.   The copies which the Committee has will be made available to both victims and in those circumstances then Mr Hole is at liberty to put certain questions to his clients on the basis of these statements made and whether or not I cross-examination would depend on what comes out.  It is very unlikely I will be doing any further cross-examination.</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a>	I may say that Brig Simandla and Miss Msutwana, certainly Brigadier, has indicated that he does not oppose, I don't know whether it's the right stage to mention this, but before I forget he does not oppose the applications for amnesty, he says in the interests of reconciliation in this country.   Miss Msutwana is EAST LONDON HEARING	AMNESTY/E CAPE</p>

<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> I take it the affidavits will become public documents.   Other people also want access to them.</p>

<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Before you proceed to deal with the evidence of Mr Thompson, may I just ask Mr Thoba one question.  I want to know where did you obtain the substance which you poured on the private parts of Miss Msutwana, this Isiqwapaqwapa?   Where was this obtained from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">MR THOBA:</span> This Isiqwapaqwapa, the substance I found it from members of the Security Police, W/O Makwetu in the Zwelitsha Police Station and Sergeant Mzimkulu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Was it normally used in the interrogation of victims?</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">MR THOBA:</span> It was the first time I saw that tool and they told me that they always use it but I only knew about the tube.   When I asked them what kind of a substance was this, they told me that it is a medicine that is normally used by Zionists.</p>

<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLE:</span> Would you tell the Commission today, the Committee, how do you feel about what you took part in the gross treatment that was meted out by your colleagues and yourself to these victims before the Committee today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">MR THOMPSON:</span> I hurt a lot because what I did to them, me and my colleagues was very painful.  And thus I ask for forgiveness.  I would not have laughed or accepted it if it was done to me but because of the working circumstances then we had to handle them in the manner that we did.</p>

<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a>Nomalungela Msutwana, who is a girlfriend of Mr Charles Sebe.  Mr Sebe escaped or he was released when he was sentenced for terrorism at maximum security prison in Middeldrift. There was information that landed in Elite offices that she is a link between her sister and Charles Sebe, after Charles Sebe had already escaped. That is when we interrogated and cross-questioned her about the assignment she was given by Charles Sebe on this side.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a>	Miss Lindela Maqoma and Mrs Nomoy are sisters.  They are Chief Lent Maqoma's daughters who was an ex-minister here in Ciskei and he launched an organisation called Ciskei People's Rights Protection Party.  He is also said to be a member of Illisolomzi.  Mrs Nomoy's husband which is Ben Nomoyi also became a member of that Ciskei Peoples' Rights Protection Party and Illisolomzi as well.   They escaped and sought political asylum in Transkei where they stayed for some time.  These two victims followed thereafter and stayed in Transkei.	They came back, they infiltrated unnoticed but we heard through our informers that they were around and they were suspected that they were being assigned to come here and that's when we cross-questioned them about Illisolomzi's activities and as to why were they here.</p>

<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a><span class="speaker">MR THOMPSON:</span> No they were not lawful, because even the organisation itself, Illisolomzi and the Peoples' Rights were banned in Ciskei.   Therefore, we had to know them and find them because they were radicals.</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLE:</span> Can you tell the Commission what was the aim of the Ciskei Peoples' Rights Protection Party?</p>

If you have a look at Annexure F of the bundle, which is the Appeal Court Judgement at page 4 at the top of that judgment, of this one relating to this particular application it's F of the whole bundle.</p>

<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLE:</span> Can you tell the Committee what this operation was all about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOM:</span> According to my knowledge this Operation Katzen it was planned in Transkei by Illisolomzi Military wing of the Peoples' Rights Protection Party.   This operation was to overthrow the late Mr Sebe who was the President of Ciskei at the time.  This operation was to be carried out by this Party that I have already mentioned and its military wing assisted by the Transkei Defence Force and other members of the Military Intelligence of South Africa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a>	This happened and its aims were to overthrow the existing Ciskei Government then.   This happened because there was an attack in Bisho during February 1987, I cannot recall the date exactly as it is quite some time now.   The aims of this operation was to unite these two homelands, starting at Mzimkulu up to Gamtoos River. </p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a>	Secondly, it was to suppress the political organisations that were in the border region.  If I can recall clearly information that we got was that since it was known by the Military Intelligence of Transkei and Illisolomzi and the South African Military Unit the intention was to suppress all the political parties in the border region in order to prepare for the elections so that the National Party should win.   </p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLE:</span> In your application, Sir you make mention of the fact that the Ciskei Government was seen as being too lenient on the African National Congress and its allies.</p>

In your affidavit Sir, you also mention that there was a constant change of Commissioners of Police in the Ciskei hierarchy at the time.  Can you expand more on this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOM:</span> Police commissioners were being changed frequently in Ciskei at that time because there was an unrest and there was a feeling that the agents have already infiltrated the Ciskei.  And this led to the interchange because nobody seems to be trusted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLE:</span> On page three of your aaffidavit, starting from paragraph no 13, you make mention of the fact that after Gen Sebe was put in custody he was replaced by Gen Makuse who was also removed in March the following year and replaced by Gen Zozi.   And Zozi removed again six months later and replaced by Brig Takane.  In February the follow year Brig Takane was removed and succeeded by Gen Makuzi.  Is this what was taking place in Ciskei at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOM:</span> Yes it is so Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLE:</span> In other words, nobody could be trusted even in the Security Police and in the Security Forces themselves?</p>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOM:</span> Yes, I will add on the fact mentioned by Mr Thoba that even Mr Gendani was charged, because at that time there was not even trust by the Government even on high ranking officers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLE:</span> You have read Mr Thoba's affidavit and in there is reference to the trial of Mr Mlungisi Genda.  In that annexure,</p>

<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOM:</span> I was not one of those members but I just heard that he was beaten by those four Captains.  And there was a court procedure because of that where they were sentenced and their fine was paid by the State.  If I can remember clearly each of them was fined R600,00 but that was paid by the State.</p>

<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOM:</span> It was Kwane Sebe, son of the late President.  He was heading the Elite Unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line568"><a name="pos568"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLE:</span> In other words reported to his father about the activities of his unit?</p>

It is Annexure D and Annexure F of his affidavit, Mr Chairman.  Sir, are you aware of incidents where people whose origin could be traced back to Transkei were in fact repatriated by the Ciskei State?</p>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOM:</span> I know about the soldiers who came to Bisho.  One soldier died because there was a lot of shooting.

It might perhaps not be easy to</p>
<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a>understand why some of these acts had taken place, but I will not proceed in this line any further.   I think I've (...indistinct)</p>

<p class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAKOM:</span> When I made an application I thought it was necessary to mention this because I was there when she was being tortured.  EAST LONDON HEARING	AMNESTY/E CAPE</p>

<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a>At a certain stage I also tortured her even though I was not there all the time.  I left the others, continuing with the torturing.  But after the Reconciliation Act I thought it was necessary to reconcile with her, because truly no matter what the circumstances were at the time she was tortured and ill-treated.  I ask for forgiveness from Miss Msutwana.  I ask for reconciliation, that we walk hand in hand into the new South Africa, because I did not fight with her personally, even Mr Simandla, Mrs Nomoy or her sister Nomanlungela.  I ask for forgiveness today.  I am sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line593"><a name="pos593"></a>	Because on reflection in jail, even though past deeds were perpetrated on our people, it was never my aim as a policeman, but I was on duty.  I would have been in trouble if I did not show that I would stand up and protect the Ciskeian Government of the day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line594"><a name="pos594"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLE:</span> Sir can you tell the Committee how long do you still have to sit in custody in respect of the offences of which you are convicted?</p>

They did ill-treat people and torture people but there is a fact that must be known, they enjoyed it.   Even if they were instructed that they should beat people up they were not given instructions to per se to beat them.   They were just merely given instructions to investigate about the truth.</p>

<p class="line" id="line647"><a name="pos647"></a>	I want to refer to the issue about the keys.  I reported to them.  They were meant to give a report to Noqela and Pasha.  They did not go to them.  Therefore, they were meant to come to me directly.  ...(intervention)</p>

<p class="line" id="line649"><a name="pos649"></a>the Committee is really concerned to ascertain whether or not these applicants, in the light of the evidence they have given, and the information they have provided should be granted amnesty, And I think what the Committee is more interested to hear from you is what your attitude is and whether you would like the Committee to make a recommendation that would be referred to the Reparations and Rehabilitation Committee, so that possibly damages can be obtained for you, by reason of your previous assaults.   This is merely to find out what your attitude is towards amnesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line650"><a name="pos650"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Mr Brink have you canvassed Mr Simandla's view with regard to the substance of the application, whether he wants to oppose the application?  I am just basing my view on his remarks.</p>

<p class="line" id="line654"><a name="pos654"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MALL:</span> If he gives evidence which goes contrary to what the applicants have said, one or other of the applicants has said it may then be necessary for him to be cross-examined in order to find out which version is acceptable.  He has not taken an oath to give evidence in that regard and if it is still your wish to confine his comments to the issue that you talk about then perhaps he should get going with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line655"><a name="pos655"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Yes.   Would you indicate to the Committee Brigadier, what your attitude is.  You indicated to me this morning, you will recollect, that you thought although you were not happy and you believe these people enjoyed doing what they did to you you thought in the interests of reconciliation you would not oppose amnesty.  I am quite neutral in this affair, but I would like to have your views.</p>
<p class="line" id="line656"><a name="pos656"></a><span class="speaker">BRIG SIMANDLA:</span> As I said I am not opposing this application, because of our country, South Africa, and its endeavour to reach a point of reconciliation, I am not disputing or against the amnesty.</p>

<p class="line" id="line673"><a name="pos673"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLE ADDRESSES COMMITTEE:</span> Honourable members of the Committee you have heard the evidence by these applicants.  They have sketched a story of having been members of a Security Unit in the Ciskei Police, specifically called the Elite Unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line674"><a name="pos674"></a>It does seem to be common cause that whatever acts, deeds or crimes that they stand before you in respect of, these were committed in the course and scope of their employment as members of the Security Forces of the government of the day in the former state of Ciskei.   </p>
<p class="line" id="line675"><a name="pos675"></a>	A question has to be answered whether these acts that they have confessed to confirms with the definition of the Act in respect of which this Committee may extend amnesty.  In my submission, Mr Chairman, the offences or the acts that they have made themselves guilty of, which they have now confessed before this Honourable Committee, are offences or deeds or acts or missions as defined in the Act.</p>
<p class="line" id="line676"><a name="pos676"></a>	It also has to be asked whether they have made application which complies with the requirements of this Act and in my </p>
<p class="line" id="line677"><a name="pos677"></a>EAST LONDON HEARING	AMNESTY/E CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line678"><a name="pos678"></a>MR HOLE	51	ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line679"><a name="pos679"></a>submission they have.  They have made a proper application which were duly processed by the Logistic Unit of the Commission and it was decided that a hearing should be held and the hearing has duly been held and they have been afforded an opportunity to state their case and in my submission the acts of which they have made themselves guilty of relate to an act associated with a political objective, committed in the course of the conflict of the past.</p>
<p class="line" id="line680"><a name="pos680"></a>	The Committee will recall the evidence they have given at large about their political situation in the country which they served at the time, the tensions between the so-called states of Transkei and Ciskei and the role that the security forces had to play to try and calm the situation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line681"><a name="pos681"></a>	It will also be asked by the Committee whether they have made a full disclosure of the relevant facts. In my submission Mr Chairman, they have, in fact in two instances, if I am not mistaken, they have even applied for amnesty in respect of offences for which they were not even been convicted of.   </p>
<p class="line" id="line682"><a name="pos682"></a>	We are here dealing with convicted persons who are sitting in jail and it would not make their case any lighter if they confess to other deeds than for which they are sitting in jail, but in the case of Mr Makom for instance, the third applicant, he has confessed to the torture and assault on Miss Msutwana.  Mr Thoba and Mr Thompson have also confessed to the assault on Miss Maqoma.   The Committee will recall their evidence to the effect that they were acquitted in respect of these assaults, but they have laid their souls bare to the Committee and confessed heir guilt in respect of these.</p>
<p class="line" id="line683"><a name="pos683"></a>	The Committee, Mr Chairman, will recall that extracts of the judgment by the Regional Court magistrate and in one instance the Supreme Court of Ciskei, detailing the assault, some of it very EAST LONDON HEARING	AMNESTY/E CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line684"><a name="pos684"></a>MR HOLE	52	ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line685"><a name="pos685"></a>tviolent, which they perpetrated on these victims, were put to them and they readily admitted their complicity in those offences.   In my submission they have thereby satisfied the requirements of Section 20 of the Act regarding the granting of amnesty to applicants.   </p>
<p class="line" id="line686"><a name="pos686"></a>	Perhaps I should now, Mr Chairman, deal with whether or not the acts they have made themselves guilty of, the acts for which they seek this tribunal's amnesty are according to the definition acts or missions which were done with the political objective which were advised or planned or directed or committed within or outside the Republic.   </p>
<p class="line" id="line687"><a name="pos687"></a>	It is common cause, Mr Chairman, that they were members of the state security forces.   It is common cause that at some instance some of them were commanded and at one instance one of them was in command of an interrogation team.   It is common cause also that, as I have stated before their interrogations were in terms of an Act of Parliament, the National Security Act of Ciskei, which enabled agents of the state to detain and question persons who were held indefinitely at times at the pleasure of the state.   So, there is no dispute as to the official nature of these detentions, but a question might be asked, Mr Chairman, whether acts such as these, the undressing of a lady, the abusing of a lady, pouring her over with water and applying a substance which had a burning effect on her private parts, or switching on a fan and place it next to a lady who is </p>
<p class="line" id="line688"><a name="pos688"></a>unconscious in order to revive her, could be acts as contemplated by this Act.   In my submission, Mr Chairman, all these acts were.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line689"><a name="pos689"></a>	This Committee has heard quite gruesome acts perpetrated in the name of the state.   In some instances, Mr Chairman, murders were committed and people came forward and confessed to murders EAST LONDON HEARING	AMNESTY/E CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line690"><a name="pos690"></a>MR HOLE	53	ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line691"><a name="pos691"></a>of persons for a political objective.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line692"><a name="pos692"></a>	In this present case, Mr Chairman, people, especially women were given the worst treatment one can imagine, short of killing them, but having said this I wish to say that it is indeed an act contemplated by this Act.   </p>
<p class="line" id="line693"><a name="pos693"></a>	One might perhaps ask why not simply slap her around, why not kick her or why not shove her against the wall?   But it does appear that the whole object, Mr Chairman, was to instil fear.  The whole object was to make anybody afraid, or shall I use the term Mr Chairman, the whole object was to terrorise members of a political organisation which sought to overthrow the government of the day.  Whether this government was legitimate or not is now besides the point, but what was done, Mr Chairman is that terror was used, extreme fear was unleashed on people for two reasons.  	One, to gain information from them about their activities or the activities of members of Illisolomzi who might be in Ciskei or about the escape of Mr Charles Sebe from prison, or the people who assisted him to jump prison and the abduction of the Head of the Elite Unit, General Kwane Sebe.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line694"><a name="pos694"></a>	The other objective Mr Chairman, was to instil as much fear in the hearts of anybody who associated himself, sympathised with or was a member of this political organisation Illisolomzi, or the Ciskei Peoples' Rights Protection Party.</p>
<p class="line" id="line695"><a name="pos695"></a>	Perhaps the difference would be in the methods used in instilling fear and terror, but I think the Committee will agree with me that we have lived through very terrible times. At some instances hit squads were used to mow down people, women and children in the name of the government.  In some instances women and children were killed in the name of the struggle.   </p>
<p class="line" id="line696"><a name="pos696"></a>	And in the present case before this honourable Committee a man and women were tortured very severely, I readily concede, but EAST LONDON HEARING	AMNESTY/E CAPE</p>

<p class="line" id="line698"><a name="pos698"></a>this was still in the name of the government of the day, the government of President Lennox Sebe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line699"><a name="pos699"></a>	If one has a look at Section 20, Subsection 3(B) of the Act, the Act reads:</p>

<p class="line" id="line703"><a name="pos703"></a>	Clearly, Mr Chairman, there were treasonable acts being done in Ciskei, according to the laws of Ciskei at that time.  People were detained, a member and the Head of the Elite Unit, the son of the President was abducted and taken to Transkei, people claimed responsibility for detaining him, a neighbouring state was training troops to overthrow Ciskei, pamphlets were distributed by Illisolomzi in Ciskei, inciting and fanning the flames of revolution in Ciskei.   The Security Police of which these applicants were members had to act against this kind of conduct.</p>

<p class="line" id="line709"><a name="pos709"></a>	In my submission, Mr Chairman, the acts of these people, the applicants, gruesome as they may have been, were directed against people perceived to belong to Illisolomzi or have association with members of Illisolomzi or agents of Illisolomzi.    Whether this information was correct or not, in my submission, does not affect the case either way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line710"><a name="pos710"></a>	What we should look at, Mr Chairman, is the state of mind of the applicants at the time.  Whether they believed that these people had this information.  They have given evidence, Mr Chairman, to say there was a whole lot of information about Brig Simandla, the question about the key having been lost, which the Brigadier has also alluded to in his unsworn statement.   There was a question of the guard who was not posted at the tower.  There was a question of the guards who were disarmed, shortly before the assault on the prison and all these things, the </p>

<p class="line" id="line712"><a name="pos712"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Can I just interpose there Mr Hole, but insofar as Miss Msutwana is concerned the evidence before us, is that she was not particularly involved in the activities of Illisolomzi.  She was only related to a sister of Charles Sebe's girlfriend.  And there is no evidence also linking the sister to the activities of Illisolomzi.   How can you draw such an inference?</p>

<p class="line" id="line716"><a name="pos716"></a>sister to a girlfriend of Gen Charles Sebe, but they go further than that, Honourable Commissioner, they say:  </p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line717"><a name="pos717"></a>"The Elite Unit had information that she was a contact between Charles Sebe and in that capacity she was being used by Charles Sebe to communicate between Charles Sebe and her sister."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line718"><a name="pos718"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> There is no evidence that her sister was involved with Illisolomzi.   I mean for all that we can take care of is that we can take into account that the link might have been concerning the affairs of the heart.  I mean here was General - I mean, Mr Charles Sebe wanting to make contact with the sister in connection with affairs which had no relation to the political activities of himself as a member of Illisolomzi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line719"><a name="pos719"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLE:</span> I take the point given by the Honourable Member of the Committee, but if we were to look at the Act under which these people were detained, they were detained in terms of the National Security Act.   This is an Act which was passed to enable police, to give them extra powers to detain and question persons in respect with subversive activities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line720"><a name="pos720"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> But wasn't their main interest in respect of her to discover how the contact was made, who the contact people were who were bringing messages or taking messages to Charles Sebe, who was a very dangerous man in an adjoining country?   And that is what they wanted from her was it not?   Information as to how contact was made.</p>
<p class="line" id="line721"><a name="pos721"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLE:</span> That and much more perhaps.   One can imagine a situation where people did not have much information and they were looking for as much information as they can get.  If one looks at the judgment of Judge Pickard he sketches Charles Sebe's profile in a very distinct way.   This was the Commander General of all the Ciskei forces.  He commanded all their Army</p>

<p class="line" id="line725"><a name="pos725"></a>	Surely, you would not have expected the police to question her about matters of the heart.  Surely they would have questioned her about a pending assault on the President, about a coup, about army bandits who were being trained in a foreign country?</p>

<p class="line" id="line728"><a name="pos728"></a>Charles Sebe's lady friend to find out what information she has received, what information she is to pass on to his followers if he had any, but to extend that to a sister of this lady and to subject her to the kind of torture that she has been subjected to is something that cannot be easily justified.  They knew beforehand that she was merely the sister of the lady and if anybody had information it would be the sister and not she.</p>
<p class="line" id="line729"><a name="pos729"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLE:</span> That might be a point, Mr Chairman, but again I wish to ask the Committee to look at it against the background that in one of the affidavits by Mr Thoba. Mr Thoba says</p>

<p class="line" id="line733"><a name="pos733"></a>These were junior officers some of them.   At least they were not ranked like Gen Charles Sebe, like Gen Kwane Sebe or Col Panzi who gave all the orders.  The highest ranking seems to have been a captain, Mr Katangana at some stage and a lieutenant at some stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line734"><a name="pos734"></a>	One cannot impute much creativeness to them.  One cannot impute much sophistication to these people.  It appeared that the people that they got, namely these victims, they tried to extract as much as information as they could from them.   And in two cases the Committee already knows that they failed dismally, because it appears that these people did not know anything.  But what is clear Mr Chairman, is that the assaults on these people did not seem to be assaults that had no purpose.</p>

<p class="line" id="line736"><a name="pos736"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLE:</span> Did not seem to be assaults that had no purpose that was being tried to achieve.</p>

<p class="line" id="line748"><a name="pos748"></a>	And if one looks at the evidence of Mr Thompson and Mr Thoba, especially the annexures that are given by them,  Mr Chairman I am referring to the annexure, relating to the case of Gen Genda, Col Genda, where detailed evidence was given by a W/O Magaoli of the Elite Unit who had infiltrated the Illisolomzi.  Who gave information and testified in court about the plans that Illisolomzi had about toppling the Ciskeian government.   He gives a graphic picture of the infiltration of the presidential guard and the capturing of the President, taking him to Radio </p>
<p class="line" id="line749"><a name="pos749"></a>Ciskei where he would be forced to make a statement in terms of which he will be standing down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line750"><a name="pos750"></a>	There is also reference to the President, being killed in the event of him refusing to step down.   I think one should look at that picture against unsophisticated police who had very little evidence and who had three victims from which they had to get as much as possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line751"><a name="pos751"></a>	If one looks as the affidavits of all of them they say pressure was being put on them to find the President's son alive.</p>
<p class="line" id="line752"><a name="pos752"></a>If one looks at this broad picture one can see clearly that the act which these people were committing was directed at a political opponent and not just against private individuals.

<p class="line" id="line757"><a name="pos757"></a>	This was an attack more on the institution of Illisolomzi and its supporters than it was an attack on the individuals themselves.   Brutality of an extreme kind was meted out to these people, but this was not just blind violence, this was violence meant to extend extreme terror to anybody who might want to join this organisation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line758"><a name="pos758"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> You keep saying, extend extreme terror, none of your applicants said that that was their intention.  They said they were trying to interrogate these people, didn't they?</p>

<p class="line" id="line760"><a name="pos760"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLE:</span> Honourable Committee member, a reading of all these applicants' affidavits can only leave one with one impression, that extreme terror was meted out to these people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line761"><a name="pos761"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Yes, for the purpose of getting information.  Not - you're broadening it to say it was to terrify members of the organisation.  They were ill-treating, brutally ill-treating these people to make them talk.  Is it not what they have all said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line762"><a name="pos762"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLE:</span> That is what they have all said yes.  Now, if I may proceed, Mr Chairman, to deal with the relationship between the act these people have made themselves guilty of and the attainment of their political objective.</p>
<p class="line" id="line763"><a name="pos763"></a>	It is my submission that submitting these people to </p>
<p class="line" id="line764"><a name="pos764"></a>this kind of inhumane treatment was done with a view to getting these people to answer certain questions and to confess to certain deeds.   The result of information that would have been obtained by them through this method would have been given to the Commander of these operations and in turn one can assume that the Commander would have given these to the President.  The information they would have given would naturally have been intelligence that would have been useful for the political </p>

<p class="line" id="line767"><a name="pos767"></a>situation assessment.   Information that would have been useful for the President's son to be found or information that would have been useful for them to know who exactly had sprung Charles Sebe from jail.</p>
<p class="line" id="line768"><a name="pos768"></a>	In my submission the acts they had made themselves guilty of were not remote from the political objective that they wished to seek.</p>
<p class="line" id="line769"><a name="pos769"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Mr Hole, would a reasonable policeman have used the same means which your clients used subjecting the women under the humiliation they were subjected to in order to extract the information that they intended to extract from their victims?</p>
<p class="line" id="line770"><a name="pos770"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLE:</span> Thank you, Honourable Member of the Committee.  The idea of a reasonable policeman is a very elusive one.  Certainly I cannot be heard to submit that we know of any in South Africa.   The evidence we have heard from these people is that the methods that they have used on these people, except for Isixwapaxwapa which they admit for the first time, was what was used for interrogations throughout, when they joined the Elite Unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line771"><a name="pos771"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MALL:</span> That may be so, but the brutality of their methods, are they not out of all proportion to the kind of information that they were seeking from a girlfriend or Sebe or the sister of a girlfriend of Sebe for example?  They are totally disproportionate to the objective that they had in mind.</p>
<p class="line" id="line772"><a name="pos772"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOLE:</span> Mr Chairman, if one looked at the events in Ciskei at the time, if one looked at the fact that it was their own Commanding Officer who had been abducted, drugged and put in the boot of a car and taken by an opposing party to Transkei and which Transkei was hostile to the state that they was serving, one can understand how such extreme measures were used.</p>
<p class="line" id="line773"><a name="pos773"></a>	Also looking at the fact that these ladies were transported from Douglasdale Farm in the boot of a vehicle to the police </p>
<p class="line" id="line774"><a name="pos774"></a>EAST LONDON HEARING	AMNESTY/E CAPE</p>
<p class="line" id="line775"><a name="pos775"></a>MR HOLE	63	ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line776"><a name="pos776"></a>station, one would assume that there would be people at the police station who would have seen them off-loading people from the boot.   If one reads that scenario, Mr Chairman, one can see that it appears that even the Uniform Branch who might have been manning the Alice Police Station did not care two hoots about what was happening to these people, otherwise they would not have transported them to a police station in the boot of a car.	This is the level to which the members serving in the Ciskei Police Force at the time had sunk.   The transporting of a person in the boot of a car was also done to Gen Kwane Sebe, the son of the President, according to the affidavits of these people, when he was taken to Transkei.</p>
<p class="line" id="line777"><a name="pos777"></a>	In my submission Mr Chairman, these applicants have made a proper case for the extension of amnesty to them.   I would, on the basis of this and my argument and the evidence that have tended before this Committee, request that the Committee may be pleased to grant amnesty to each one them in respect of each of these offences.</p>
<p class="line" id="line778"><a name="pos778"></a>	Unless the Committee wants to hear me on any further aspect, that would be my address on the merits of the matter.   Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>

<p class="line" id="line781"><a name="pos781"></a>	Yes, I have no difficulty with the aspects of full disclosure Mr Chairman and members of the Committee at all. And I also have no real difficulty with all things being equal, no difficulty with an assault which may have been perpetrated on a political detainee.  The question is where does one draw the </p>

<p class="line" id="line784"><a name="pos784"></a>line?   You have here men having been charged with crimen injuria.  That, in this particular case, amounts to an offence of a sexual nature.  I have grave difficulty in seeing how an offence of that sort can be said to have been committed with a political objective in view.</p>
<p class="line" id="line785"><a name="pos785"></a>	I accept what my colleague has said in regard to the situation then prevailing in Ciskei.   I accept that there </p>
<p class="line" id="line786"><a name="pos786"></a>was an awful atmosphere, and I accept that everyone was being rounded up whenever there was the slightest suspicion of disloyalty to government -  (Background very noisy.)</p>
<p class="line" id="line787"><a name="pos787"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MALL:</span> You cannot compete with that noise.</p>
<p class="line" id="line788"><a name="pos788"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Certainly not.   As I say I accept that there was -the situation then prevailing in Transkei was such that anyone who was vaguely suspected of being disloyal to the government would have been picked up, detained, beaten up, tortured and so on, yes, but the essence of the problem with which you're faced is whether an offence of a sexual nature can be regarded as having been committed with a political objective.</p>
<p class="line" id="line789"><a name="pos789"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> It was not of a sexual nature in any normal sense of the word was it, Mr Brink?  It was torturing someone by administering some liquid to their sexual organs, it was not for any sexual gratification.</p>
<p class="line" id="line790"><a name="pos790"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Well, I say this with respect if you have a naked woman and you tell her to take off her underclothes, make her lie on the floor and then you mock at her genitalia.</p>
<p class="line" id="line791"><a name="pos791"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> You humiliate her as much as you can.  You kick her around. It was absolute brutality and humiliation.  It was not in the normal thing that people commit sexual offences to achieve some sort of sexual gratification. There is no suggestion of that here, is there?</p>

<p class="line" id="line793"><a name="pos793"></a>MR BRINK	65	ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line794"><a name="pos794"></a>in the sense that improper advances had been made I take your point, but there must have been some degree of gratification for these men to behave as they did, but I accept what you say, Mr Chairman, I accept what you say in regard to the - it wasn't a sexual offence in the ordinary accepted meaning of the term.  I take the point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line795"><a name="pos795"></a>	In conclusion then I ask the Committee to please have these two victims referred, in terms of Section 22, to the Reparations and Rehabilitation Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line796"><a name="pos796"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> It is a relevant factor isn't it which hasn't been mentioned by the applicants that while the attack on Miss Msutwana was taking place it was done in the presence from time to time of a Lt Col who was in charge of them, who walked in and out, who took part in the assault at times.  He knew what was going on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line797"><a name="pos797"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Yes, that is relevant in regard to all of this.  I presume or condoning the behaviour.   Of course there is no evidence that that person himself gave a specific order for the assaults to take place, but he certainly associated himself with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line798"><a name="pos798"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Well he kicked her himself.	And the other factor that I think is relevant to indicate the attitude of the Ciskei Police as a whole is the effort made by Col Simandla, to make known what had happened to him and was just ignored.  He told the Station Commander, he said oh nothing can be done about it.  He told a visiting Colonel, nothing was done.  He saw the injuries, but apparently no further reports were made, it was allowed to drift on, which would appear to indicate that it was accepted by those higher ranking and in other things that this was the way things happened in the Ciskei at the time.</p>
