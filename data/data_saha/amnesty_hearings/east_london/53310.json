I hit him with the hammer because I wanted him to give us the firearms.  I hit him three times on his back with the hammer.  I kicked him while sitting on his bed.

We insisted until such time they opened the door.  When they opened, as we were knocking there someone enquired, asked who, he wanted to know who was knocking at the door.  We told that person that we were comrades from Tanzania, we wanted to get to the farmhouse.  They opened the door and we got inside.  We asked them to direct us to the farmhouse.  We borrowed the pliers with the aim of cutting the telephone wire. \n\tWe left that house, we went straight to the farmhouse.  When we arrived there we saw a pole, a telephone pole.  One of us climbed up the pole, that was Inzunzi Manatoza and then he cut the telephone wire.  Having cut the telephone wire we went to the main house, we knocked there.  I was also there I was among the people who were knocking there, we were knocking at the door.\n\tMelvin Nkosana was the one who was talking at the door.  He knocked and he said we were visitors, we were paying Mr Eric Cobus a visit.  When he heard the voice, when he detected that the people who were talking outside there were Xhosa people he said \"I'm not going to open the door because I'm afraid you're going to shoot me\" and he said that - he started firing.  Melvin got a broom from the veranda.  He knocked with that broom hitting the window with that broom.\n\tWe went to the other side of the house, to the other side at the front of the house and we saw a window there, bathroom window that was closed.  It had some net, a thin net, it was covered in a thin net and we pulled that net, we pushed the window up and we got inside.  The other people, the others were still surrounding the house.  When we got inside the house we heard gunshots.  They were heard from the direction of the corridor where his bedroom was.  I opened a cupboard, I saw a rope in that cupboard.  As the others were still destructing by hitting the windows, as he was still paying attention to the people who were disturbing him under windows, this is when we got a chance to tie this rope, to tie this bedroom door that was on the passage with this rope, then we tried to pull it but it was very difficult for it to bend or be removed.  We did not get a chance to get to his bedroom because he was firing.  If my memory serves me well I think a gas cylinder was taken out of the house to the window, to his bedroom window.  We placed them there but I'm not very sure, I'm not so sure about this, we placed these gas cylinders and we opened them, trying to release the gas inside.  We lit a match and there was a big flame.  Our aim was to try to get him out of this room.  Even there he did not give up.  He continued firing.  I ran away leaving the others behind.  I went home.  That is all.",

The police came, they instructed us to get inside the hall within five minutes but it was a lot of us, it was impossible for us to get inside the hall.  Just before that, five minutes elapsed, they fired i.e. the police and the soldiers.  There were police casspirs and the military vehicles.  They fired inside the hall.  Having done that they left.  After they had left the hall the police and the soldiers, we tried to help the other people injured in the hall because that hall was made of cement bricks and corrugated iron and people sustained injuries from the material that the hall was made of and the glass and even the hall itself was demolished, the walls, and the people who sustained injuries there were taken photographs of.  One of those people was a person who was a teacher at Stutterheim.  He got injured in the leg and the other casualties were elderly people.  Those people were taken to the hospital in Stutterheim.  In Stutterheim they were not welcome, they were then taken to King Williamstown and to Mdanzani where they were admitted.  Those who sustained minor injuries were treated in the local clinics.\n\tThe person who was there was a Reverend Father and Mr Njtingwa, that is Reverend Ntjingwa, and another one who is a mayor in Stutterheim who is known as Chris Makwanani.  Those Reverend went out of the hall being assaulted by the police.  That is all.\n\tOther things that took place in the - after this incident of the hall it was at the soccer playground where Umfana Green was addressing the meeting telling us that we are to go to the farms and intimidate the farmers to leave their farms and get weapons from them.  We took an action on that very same day.  In one farm, Madameni Farm, what happened there was this.  We surrounded the house, pelting it with stones, trying to get this white man out of the house.  This white man was a soldier.  We could not reach his place because he went out and he started firing and we set garage alight where his tractor was kept.  After having done all these things, after the Kei route, we left with a comrade, Umfana Green was present and the others and Mujoju Ndane and Apol Ndane were there and the others.  We got into this house of this white man.  We pelted the roof with stones.  No one came out but we saw the cars inside the yard.  I had petrol in my possession and we went into the house and we caused chaos and we searched the house for weapons.  Fortunately we saw this big truck with weapons inside.  We took this truck out of the house.  We poured petrol inside the house and we set it alight.  After having left that house we also got hold of an axe, we destroyed this trunk with this axe.  We found two firearms, a long one and a short one but during the time because some people who were arrested on that day, in court the owner of the house came in court and he said he is not prepared to lay charges on anyone because he knew very well that the comrades were the cause of these things so he was actually doing away with the charges, he was dismissing the charges.",
