            "Thank you Mr Chairman.\n\tThis is the statement prepared in support of an application by the first applicant, Mr Kwanale Enoch Thoba.  It is in the form of an affidavit.\n\tMr Chairman it reads as follows:\n\"The facts deposed to hereunder are within my personal knowledge unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise\n\tindicates.\"\nThen he recounts his personal circumstances.   He says:\n\"I am 45 years old and married.  I have three children, the eldest whom is doing standard seven.  My last born is still too young to go to school.\n\tI have been a member of the Police Force since the 6th of \nEAST LONDON HEARING\tAMNESTY/E CAPE\nMR HOLE\t4\tMR THOBA\nJune 1979.   I attended training at the Police College Hammanskraal for six months and was on graduation attached to the Uniform Branch of the Ciskei Police.\nAfter a number of years in the Uniform Branch I was transferred to the CID where I also worked for a number of years until I was transferred to the Elite Unit of the Ciskei Police.  This is where I served until the military coup of March, 1990.\n\tThe offences of which I was convicted and in respect of which I now seek amnesty were committed whilst attached to this unit.\n\tDuring 1992 I was arrested and sentenced in separate cases for crimes involving assaults on political detainees.\n\tI am now serving a period of ten years imprisonment for these offences.\n\tAlthough the offences I have made myself guilty of did not include murder of persons, as has happened in security related cases throughout the country, they are nonetheless very serious ones and for which I wish to express remorse and if possible ask forgiveness.\n\tI have been involved in assaults and torture of political prisoners in circumstances where wisdom and good sense should have told me to act otherwise.\n\tIn order to understand why deeds like these were possible to perform perhaps one should look at the history of this region to be able to place things and understand them in proper perspective.\"   \nThen he deals with the independence of the national states and the relations between the Ciskei and the Transkei.\n\"As part of the wider scheme of apartheid Transkei became independent in 1976.  Ciskei was to follow in December 1981\nEAST LONDON HEARING\tAMNESTY/E CAPE\nMR HOLE\t5\tMR THOBA\nunder the leadership of President Sebe.  From the onset Transkei was unhappy about Ciskei being given \"independence\".   Transkei felt that Ciskei should be given to Transkei to realise their dream of a great Xhosa nation.  These attitudes strained the relations between the states and these strained relations had far reaching consequences and have a bearing on the case before this Committee.\"\nIt goes on to deal with the Ciskei state Mr Chairman.  He says,\n\"The Ciskei state was a creation of apartheid.  To qualify as a country it had to have a population over which it held sovereignty.  To achieve this masses of people were displaced and forcibly removed from the so-called black spots and removed to Ciskei.\n\tThose who could not be moved to Ciskei by promises of a land of milk and honey were moved by the Military and placed in Ciskei.\n\tA Secretary for Black Administration and Development wrote in Circular No 25 of 1967:  \n'It is accepted Government policy that the Bantu are only temporarily resident in the area of the Republic for as long as they offer their labour there.  As soon\n\t\tas they become no longer fit in the labour market they are expected to return to their country of origin or the territory of the national unit where they fit.   No stone should be left unturned to achieve this settlement in the homelands of non-productive Bantu.'\nThis is a quotation from a book by Brian Lapink, entitled \"Apartheid, A History.\"\n\tA priest, Cosmos Desmond, reported of a group that was forcibly removed and settled in Natal.  He is quoted: \n\"We found the first arrivals sitting in the bare veld,\nEAST LONDON HEARING\tAMNESTY/E CAPE\nMR HOLE\t6\tMR THOBA\nsurrounded by their belongings, looking bewildered and utterly lost.   A little distance away was a water tank and a pile of folded tents, which the people did no know how to erect.  Nothing else.\"\nThis is also a quotation from the same work.\n\"The scene painted by Father Desmond is true of many cases in Ciskei, especially in Dimbaza.   This was the kind of people His Excellency President for Life, Lennox Sebe, was presiding over.   Poor displaced and angry people.\n\t\tThe Police were caught in this trap especially those falling into the Security Police category.  It was only a question of time before more and more brutality was to be unleashed to subdue the brave ones who spoke out against the injustice.\"\n\tThen dealing with the Sebe family Mr Commissioner, Mr Chairman:\n\"If the Ciskei Government was discredited for being an apartheid structure to enforce human suffering it was\n\t\tno less discredited for being an institution of upliftment and enrichment of the Sebe family and those close to them.\n\t\tLennox Sebe was the Head of State.  His other brother was Minister of Transport.   The other brother was a Commander General of the combined forces, commanding and holding power over the following:  the Army, the Police, the Prisons, the Special Forces, the Traffic Police.  He was the most powerful person in Ciskei.  He was consulted about and authorised all detentions, under Proclamation R252, and later under the National Security Act of 1982.\"\nEAST LONDON HEARING\tAMNESTY/E CAPE\nMR HOLE\t7\tMR THOBA\n\tThe Committee is at this stage referred to a judgment by His Lordship Mr Justice Pickard in a case of the STATE v SEBE, the reference is quoted in the statement.   The judgment, Mr Chairman, is quoted at length and begins at page 16 of their representations.\n\"The sons of Namba and Charles Sebe held ranks in the armed forces as well.  It was indeed a Sebe state. During a state function held at the national shrine an unscheduled speaker rose from the ranks of the audience and advanced to the podium and made a speech based on the Scriptures.   He prophesied that in the future Charles Sebe would be powerful, even more powerful than the President.\n\t\tThe immediate result of this is that the President became fearful of his own brother and proceeded to strip him of his powers.   \n\t\tHe sidelined him in matters of state and the\n\t\tPresident's security.\n\t\tIn turn Charles Sebe became afraid of the wrath of the President.  He feared being detained as he had fallen out of favour.\"  \n\tAgain the Commission is referred to a judgment by Judge Pickard at specifically page 626.  This is Annexure A of the representations, Mr Chairman.\n\"Fear rose in the senior ranks of the police about their possible detentions.\n\t\tThe events following the demotion of Mr Charles Sebe were as follows:\nA.\tBrig Tamsanqa who had served as Charles Sebe's Deputy, was detained.\n\t\tB.\tSenior Officers, including Charles Sebe gathered \nEAST LONDON HEARING\tAMNESTY/E CAPE\nMR HOLE\t8\tMR THOBA\naround and discussed and questioned the legality of the detention.  Suggestions of releasing Tamsanqa by force were made.\n\t\tC.\tCharles Sebe was detained and charged with terrorism.  He was sentenced to 12 years' imprisonment by the Bisho Supreme Court.\nAgain the Committee is referred to Annexure A which is the judgment of Justice Pickard and Annexure B which is an article quoted from the Daily Despatch, entitled 'Charles Sebe Trial Date set at Bisho.   Annexure C, Gen Minnaar was also detained.'\n\tI am instructed, Mr Chairman, that Gen Minnaar was the side-kick of Gen Sebe.  \tAlso the Committee is referred to Annexure D which is an article by the Daily Despatch with the heading 'Sebe Jailed for Twelve Years'.    \n\"Soon after the arrest of Charles Sebe his brother, Namba, was also arrested on corruption charges.  His son Kamba, was arrested and detained by the Police.  Mr Namba Sebe sued the Commissioner of Police for arrest and detention.\n\t\tThe Government requested further particulars to the particulars of claim.  When he could not supply these the claim was dismissed with costs.\"\n\tThe Committee is referred to Annexure E which is the combined summons by Mr Namba Sebe, suing for his son and Annexure F which is the Order of the Supreme Court of Ciskei which dismissed his action with costs.\n\"Charles Sebe was to meet with a similar fate.  He sued for arrear salaries.  The Government defended the action and asked for further particulars, asking inter alia when and by whom he had been employed as a Major General in the Police Force.\nEAST LONDON HEARING\tAMNESTY/E CAPE\nMR HOLE\t9\tMR THOBA\nWhen he could not supply these particulars, his case was also dismissed with costs.\"\n\tReference is made to Annexure G which is the combined summons, and Annexure H which is the Order of Court, dismissing his action with costs.\n\"To the legal practitioner this might appear to be  a run of the mill procedure in civil litigation.  To us in the Security Forces this was a clear message that the President meant business.  If he could do these things to his flesh and blood .....\"\n\tMr Commissioner I think there is a mistake here, but I will proceed.\n\"A further factor was that the wives of his imprisoned and exiled brothers were evicted from their homes.  This was believed to be at the instance of the President or he allowed it to happen.\"\n\tMr Chairman, the Committee is again referred to Annexure I, which is an article by the Daily Despatch at the time, reporting on the eviction of Mrs Namba Sebe and Mrs Charles Sebe from their homes, which was in Tjajo in Ciskei.\n\"Namba Sebe jumped bail and sought refuge in Transkei.  Namba and Charles Sebe were tried and convicted of terrorism and sentenced to long terms of imprisonment for terrorism.  \"\nThis is Namba and Charles Sebe's sons Mr Commissioner.\n\"On the 26th of September 1985 a group of White men raided the maximum security prison in Middeldrift and freed Charles Sebe.  This was the worst nightmare of his former juniors, who had whilst he had lost power, acted against him.  Charles Sebe was reputedly powerful and influential. It was not known what he\nEAST LONDON HEARING\tAMNESTY/E CAPE\nMR HOLE\t10\tMR THOBA\nwould do when he was set free.\n\t\tThose who betrayed him had a lot to fear in the line of retribution.   Pressure was put on the juniors to find him.\"\n\tMr Chairman, the Committee is referred to Annexure J which is also an article by a local newspaper, reporting on the armed and violent skipping of Mr Charles Sebe from jail.\n\"On the same day of the escape of Charles Sebe from prison the son of the President and the Commander of the Elite Unit of which we were members Major General\n\t\tKwane Sebe and his Deputy Colonel Zandasile Waya were abducted. They were drugged and transported to Transkei in the boot of a motor vehicle.\n\t\tThe pair had been abducted from the Amatola Hotel in Bisho where Charles Sebe was seen shortly after his escape.  It was feared that they were in his hands.\n\t\tWhat became clear to the Security Forces was that we were dealing with not only with Charles Sebe but also his allies who were sophisticated and capable of out manoeuvering us. \n\t\tThere was a state of panic, and pressure was being put on the Security Forces and the Elite Unit in particular to find the President's son alive.\n\t\tSoon after the abduction of the two it was learnt through Intelligence reports that they were kept hostage by the President's brother, Mr Namba Sebe.\"\n\tThe Committee, Mr Chairman, is referred to Annexure K, which is an article by a local newspaper, reporting on the abduction and the claim made by Mr Namba Sebe that he was keeping these two hostage.\n\"Soon demands were received for the release of Tony\nEAST LONDON HEARING\tAMNESTY/E CAPE\nMR HOLE\t11\tMR THOBA\nSebe and Kamba Sebe.   These were sons of Namba and Charles Sebe respectively who were serving sentences for terrorism in Ciskei.   They had been convicted of participation in an attack on a Cabinet member's home, Mr B M Pitje.\n\t\tThese were most dangerous times in Ciskei.  Days of intrigue and subterfuge.\t\n\t\tThey were made even worse by the apparent free hand\n\t\tthe Ciskei state gave to the insurgents ...(indistinct).\n\t\tSoon after the escape of Charles Sebe reports were received that he had joined an organisation, called Illisolomzi, formed by Ben Nomoy and Lent Maqoma, the latter a former member of the parliament in Ciskei.\n\t\tReports of a guerilla unit under training were received.   The Ciskei Government Intelligence fraternity sent W O Sidney Magauwli to infiltrate Illisolomzi.  He sent home reports of the training, personnel and plans of Illisolomzi.   What was most disturbing about the reports was that the armed units were trained by and with the assistance of the Transkei Defence Force.\n\t\tPamphlets were distributed in Ciskei by Illisolomzi.  One of the pamphlets confirmed that Charles Sebe had become a member of this movement.\"\n\tThe Committee is now referred to Annexure L, which is an article by a local newspaper, reporting on the conviction of the sons of Mr Namba and Charles Sebe for terrorism. \n\"The period after the escape of Charles Sebe was met by panic, fear and mass detentions of those perceived to belong to his organisation or were sympathetic to\nEAST LONDON HEARING\tAMNESTY/E CAPE\nMR HOLE\t12\tMR THOBA\nits cause.\n\t\tIt was in that context that Brig Simandla, Miss Msutwana and Mrs Nomoy were detained and tortured.\n\t\tThis is by no means to justify acts of torture and suffering but to try, difficult as it might be, to\n\t\texplain the context in which such acts took place. \n\t\tMiss Msutwana was believed to be connected to Charles Sebe through her sister.   \n\t\tMrs Nomoy's husband was believed to be a member of Illisolomzi.   \n\t\tShe at that stage had been in hiding in Transkei.   Brig Simandla was head of Middeldrift Prison when Charles Sebe was freed.\n\t\tThere were reports that a cell key had been lost prior to their escape.   There were reports that he had disarmed some of the guards prior to the escape.  Whether these reports are true or not we cannot say.  They were, however, the basis of his questioning.\"\nThen, the applicant, Mr Chairman, goes on to deal with the torture of Brig Simandla. \n\"Soon after the escape of Mr Charles Sebe from Middeldrift Prison, information was received via intelligence sources that Brig Simandla who was head of Middeldrift Prison at the time, had\nA.\tCaused or allowed the guards of the perimeter fence to be disarmed on the day of the attack.\n\t\tB.\tAllowed or made it possible for a guard not to be posted at the tower post on the night of the attack. \n\t\tC.\tMade it possible for a cell key to be lost some weeks before the escape.   This key was used in \nEAST LONDON HEARING\tAMNESTY/E CAPE\nMR HOLE\t13\tMR THOBA\nthe escape.\n\t\tThis information had not been verified and Col Panzi who was acting as the head of the Elite Unit during \n\t\tthe abduction of the Officer Commanding and his Deputy, instructed people to question Brig Simandla.\n\t\tThe people instructed to do so were myself,( that is Mr Thoba, Mr Chairman), W/O Bojana, Lt Thompson.   We proceeded to Tanaga Police Station where Brig Simandla was held and proceeded to question him.   During this questioning no assaults were committed nor was the Brigadier manhandled in any manner.\n\t\tHaving completed the interrogation we proceeded to Col Panzi to brief him.   The summary of our report was that the prisoner was denying all participation in the escape of Charles Sebe.   \n\t\tBrig Simandla admitted that no guard was placed at the tower post but said this was because the toilet at the base of the tower was out of order.\n\t\tLt Thompson, who had been the head of the interrogation, told us that he had been commanded to conduct another interrogation of Brig Simandla.\n\t\tThe following day we proceeded from our Bisho offices to Thamaka Police Station to conduct the interrogation.  I noticed during interrogation that aside from Lt Thompson, Makom, myself and W/O Bojala, there were also other members of the Security Police from Mdantsane.   They also took part in the interrogation.   Again Brig Simandla gave us the same replies that he had given the previous day.\n\t\tAt this stage the Brigadier was in the interrogation room being interrogated by; (i) myself;  (ii)  W/O \nEAST LONDON HEARING\tAMNESTY/E CAPE\nMR HOLE\t14\tMR THOBA\nBojala;  (iii) W/O Nqandana of the Mdantsane Security;\n\t\t(iv) W/O Swelendao of Mdantsane Security;  (v) W/O Shulane of the Mdantsane Security;  (vi)  Lt Funane of the Mdantsane Security;  (vii) Lt Makom;  (viii) Lt Thompson.\n\t\tWe had known even before commencing this interrogation that we were to put pressure on the Brigadier to answer our questions.   This had been talked about amongst us as being the orders from Col Panzi, to get the truth by assaults from the Brigadier, if needs be.\n\t\tWhen it became apparent that we were not getting any admissions the Brigadier was ordered to undress.  Having undressed he was forced onto his stomach and suffocated with an inner tube of a motor vehicle.   Pressure was applied to the tube which caused him to suffocate.\n\t\tWhilst this was happening other persons assisted in pressing him down and others held his feet and arms.  Other people even sat on his back.   This torture carried on for a while and people used to relieve each other and others would go out for fresh air or wash their faces.\n\t\tThe object of this was to make the Brigadier confess to having had a hand in the escape and possibly gave us leads to the plotters of the escape who might still be in Ciskei. \n\t\tDuring the torture Lt Funane and Thompson seemed to be in command of the operation.  A cigarette was also used to burn Brig Simandla on his body, in an effort \n\t\tto induce him to speak.   W/O Swelendao was the one who applied the cigarette on him.\nEAST LONDON HEARING\tAMNESTY/E CAPE\nMR HOLE\t15\tMR THOBA\nAt some stage during the interrogation Brig Simandla lost consciousness and we took him out of the cell to try and revive him.  We feared that he might have been suffocated for too long and would die.\n\t\tCold water was poured over his body to try and revive  him.  After a while he came to his senses. We were now all afraid to continue and he was asked to put his clothes on.\n\t\tA report of what had taken place was given to Col Panzi who said we should be careful that the detainee does not die during interrogation.\n\t\tUp to the end of the torture Brig Simandla denied complicity in the springing of Charles Sebe from prison.\"\n\tThen Mr Chairman he proceeds to deal with the torture of Miss Nomtunzi Msutwana.\n\"Miss Msutwana was employed by the Department of Post and Telecommunication and based at Bisho.  Miss Msutwana was also one of the persons detained following the escape of Mr Charles Sebe from prison.  Her detention was in terms of the National Security Act of Ciskei.\n\t\tHaving been taken from her home she was taken for a brief moment to our offices in Bisho where she was informed of her detention.\n\t\tAfter this she was taken to the Zwelitsha Police \n\t\tDistrict Headquarters for interrogation.  I was one of the people selected to interrogate her.  \n\t\tOn arrival at the District Headquarters she was questioned about her links with Mr Charles Sebe and Illisolomzi.  She denied all association with these \nEAST LONDON HEARING\tAMNESTY/E CAPE\nMR HOLE\t16\tMR THOBA\npeople.  During the course of her interrogation Miss Msutwana became tired and refused to answer questions, possibly because some of them were repetitive.\n\t\tWhen it became clear that no information would voluntarily came from her we gave her treatment, similar to what which had been given to Brig Simandla:\n\t\t(1), she was forced to take her clothes off;\n\t\t(2), a motor car inner tube was pulled around her face to cause her to suffocate;\n\t\t(3), she was forced to lie on her back;  \n\t\t(4), a substance known as Sipapatxapa(?) was poured on her thighs and onto her vagina.  This caused an itching and irritating tract.  Burns resulted from this;\n\t\t(5), when these things were done to her, some of us would press her down to overcome any resistance.  Others held her legs and others held and pressed her arms down.\n\t\tThe people with whom I did this were:  (i) Sgt Makwetu;  Iii) Sgt Mzimkulu;  (iii) Lt Thompson.\n\t\tThese things we did caused much pain and discomfort to Miss Msutwana.  She, however, was resolute in denying any participation in the deeds we questioned her about.  She provided no information resulting in the\n\t\tescape of Mr Charles Sebe, nor Illisolomzi.\n\t\tAfter we had despaired and stopped the interrogation and torture, Col Panzi entered the interrogation room and asked if she had said anything.  We replied that she was still denying it.  He asked if we had done all that we had to do.   When we replied in the affirmative he kicked her and left the room.\"\nEAST LONDON HEARING\tAMNESTY/E CAPE\nMR HOLE\t17\tMR THOBA\n\tThen he deals, Honourable Members of the Committee, with the torture of Miss Maqoma and Mrs Nomoy.\n\"Miss Maqoma and Mrs Nomoy, who are sisters, were amongst the people detained as a follow-up to the escape of Mr Charles Sebe.  Intelligence reports were to the effect that Mrs Nomoy's husband was a member of Illisolomzi, referred to earlier in my representations.\n\t\tMiss Maqoma and Mrs Nomoy's father, Mr Lent Maqoma\n\t\twas also known to be a Illisolomzi members.   The detention of these ladies was for them to be questioned on their activities and to get information from them about the agents of Illisolomzi in the Ciskei.\n\t\tInformation had been received that these ladies had returned to Ciskei after a period of hiding in the Transkei.  The following officers were detained to take part in the arrest of these ladies:  Myself,(that is W/O Thoba Mr Chairman), Lt Thompson, W/O Bojana; and WO Makom.\n\t\tI had been the one who received a telephonic instruction from Capt Katangana to pick up men and go \n\t\tand arrest the two women.  The instructions were phoned through to me at home in the evening.  I proceeded to the homes of these Officers and told them of my instructions.\n\t\tWe drove to the home of these people at Douglasdale Farm, Alice, in two motor vehicles that same night.\n\t\tOn our arrival at Alice we started at the Police Station where we were to receive further instructions from Capt Katangana.  Indeed Capt Katangana was\nEAST LONDON HEARING\tAMNESTY/E CAPE\nMR HOLE\t18\tMR THOBA\nwaiting for us together with his twin brother.  W/O Makom, whom we could not get at his home had also travelled with them to Alice.\n\t\tFrom Alice we drove to the home of the Maqoma's.  When we arrived at the home the lights were shining inside and outside the house.  As soon as our vehicle stopped the lights were switched off.  This gave us the idea that the people were alerted to our presence and might try to escape.\t\n\t\tWe decided to surround the house and knock.  Our knocks produced no results.   I decided to kick the door in.  We penetrated the house.  A search was conducted and at different stages Mrs Nomoy and Miss Maqoma were found in the house, hiding.  One person was found under the bed and the other in the wardrobe.\n\t\tThe two women were slapped with open hands by us in the house and were sworn at and shouted at.  They were still in their sleeping clothes.   They were allowed to wear proper clothing and led out of the house.  \n\t\tAs they were being led outside, they were being \n\t\tprodded with muzzles of guns on their backs to hasten them up.   \n\t\tOutside the house they were loaded into boots of cars and driven to Alice Police Station.\n\t\tIn Alice Police Station they were kicked, slapped and insulted by us.  They were undressed and kept completely naked whilst being questioned.   A wet towel was used to throttle and suffocate them during interrogation, during questioning.\n\t\tI insulted Mrs Nomoy by saying that she is busy going up and down Transkei and Ciskei whilst her husband was\nEAST LANDON HEARING\tAMNESTY/E CAPE\nMR HOLE\t19\tMR THOBA\nbusy with his girlfriends.  When I said this she wept bitterly.\n\t\tAfter the interrogation we were satisfied that they indeed had information as their admissions about the activities of their father and Mrs Nomoy's husband corresponded with information we had.\n\t\tCapt Katanga telephoned Col Panzi and informed him of our success.  Col Panzi instructed that they be taken away to be detained at Dimbaza police cells.\n\t\tThe trauma suffered by Miss Msutwana and Brig \n\t\tSimandla, Miss Maqoma and Mrs Nomoy is beyond comparison.\n\t\tWhether or not they were involved in these activities could never have entitled them to such extreme acts of torture.  \n\t\tI have a wife and children whom I love so much.  Often whilst in the service of the Elite Unit I asked myself what helplessness and pain would overcome one \n\t\tif one were to be placed in the same circumstances I placed some of the people who came to our offices for interrogation.\n\t\tThe years I have sat in jail have given me ample opportunity to think long and hard about how my life has unfolded and the events that overcame it.\n\t\tIf there is anything that I could wish for more than amnesty it is to be loved, accepted and, hard as it might be, to be forgiven by those I have hurt so much.\n\t \tThe things I did to these victims were things I could not even mention in conversation to my wife and children when they asked how my day had been.\n\t\tIn spite of all the brutality and the pain I meted \nEAST LONDON HEARING\tAMNESTY/E CAPE\nMR HOLE\t20\tMR THOBA\nout I bore no personal grudge to any of these people.  They were people I would probably have met in like and circumstances different from what we found ourselves in.\n\t\tAnd I ask that it may please this Committee to extend amnesty to me.\"\n\tMr Chairman this affidavit was sworn to and signed by the applicant at the Mdantsane Prison on the 15th March 1997.\n\tThis concludes the written statement that he made in preparation for this, but with the leave of the Committee \nI wish to put certain questions to expand on some items to the applicant.\n\tThank you.",

They are Chief Lent Maqoma's daughters who was an ex-minister here in Ciskei and he launched an organisation called Ciskei People's Rights Protection Party.

They escaped and sought political asylum in Transkei where they stayed for some time.  These two victims followed thereafter and stayed in Transkei.\tThey came back, they infiltrated unnoticed but we heard through our informers that they were around and they were suspected that they were being assigned to come here and that's when we cross-questioned them about Illisolomzi's activities and as to why were they here.",

            "MR HOLE COMMITTEE",
            "Honourable members of the Committee you have heard the evidence by these applicants.  They have sketched a story of having been members of a Security Unit in the Ciskei Police, specifically called the Elite Unit.\nIt does seem to be common cause that whatever acts, deeds or crimes that they stand before you in respect of, these were committed in the course and scope of their employment as members of the Security Forces of the government of the day in the former state of Ciskei.   \n\tA question has to be answered whether these acts that they have confessed to confirms with the definition of the Act in respect of which this Committee may extend amnesty.  In my submission, Mr Chairman, the offences or the acts that they have made themselves guilty of, which they have now confessed before this Honourable Committee, are offences or deeds or acts or missions as defined in the Act.\n\tIt also has to be asked whether they have made application which complies with the requirements of this Act and in my \nEAST LONDON HEARING\tAMNESTY/E CAPE\nMR HOLE\t51\tADDRESS\nsubmission they have.  They have made a proper application which were duly processed by the Logistic Unit of the Commission and it was decided that a hearing should be held and the hearing has duly been held and they have been afforded an opportunity to state their case and in my submission the acts of which they have made themselves guilty of relate to an act associated with a political objective, committed in the course of the conflict of the past.\n\tThe Committee will recall the evidence they have given at large about their political situation in the country which they served at the time, the tensions between the so-called states of Transkei and Ciskei and the role that the security forces had to play to try and calm the situation.\n\tIt will also be asked by the Committee whether they have made a full disclosure of the relevant facts. In my submission Mr Chairman, they have, in fact in two instances, if I am not mistaken, they have even applied for amnesty in respect of offences for which they were not even been convicted of.   \n\tWe are here dealing with convicted persons who are sitting in jail and it would not make their case any lighter if they confess to other deeds than for which they are sitting in jail, but in the case of Mr Makom for instance, the third applicant, he has confessed to the torture and assault on Miss Msutwana.  Mr Thoba and Mr Thompson have also confessed to the assault on Miss Maqoma.   The Committee will recall their evidence to the effect that they were acquitted in respect of these assaults, but they have laid their souls bare to the Committee and confessed heir guilt in respect of these.\n\tThe Committee, Mr Chairman, will recall that extracts of the judgment by the Regional Court magistrate and in one instance the Supreme Court of Ciskei, detailing the assault, some of it very EAST LONDON HEARING\tAMNESTY/E CAPE\nMR HOLE\t52\tADDRESS\ntviolent, which they perpetrated on these victims, were put to them and they readily admitted their complicity in those offences.   In my submission they have thereby satisfied the requirements of Section 20 of the Act regarding the granting of amnesty to applicants.   \n\tPerhaps I should now, Mr Chairman, deal with whether or not the acts they have made themselves guilty of, the acts for which they seek this tribunal's amnesty are according to the definition acts or missions which were done with the political objective which were advised or planned or directed or committed within or outside the Republic.   \n\tIt is common cause, Mr Chairman, that they were members of the state security forces.   It is common cause that at some instance some of them were commanded and at one instance one of them was in command of an interrogation team.   It is common cause also that, as I have stated before their interrogations were in terms of an Act of Parliament, the National Security Act of Ciskei, which enabled agents of the state to detain and question persons who were held indefinitely at times at the pleasure of the state.   So, there is no dispute as to the official nature of these detentions, but a question might be asked, Mr Chairman, whether acts such as these, the undressing of a lady, the abusing of a lady, pouring her over with water and applying a substance which had a burning effect on her private parts, or switching on a fan and place it next to a lady who is \nunconscious in order to revive her, could be acts as contemplated by this Act.   In my submission, Mr Chairman, all these acts were.  \n\tThis Committee has heard quite gruesome acts perpetrated in the name of the state.   In some instances, Mr Chairman, murders were committed and people came forward and confessed to murders EAST LONDON HEARING\tAMNESTY/E CAPE\nMR HOLE\t53\tADDRESS\nof persons for a political objective.  \n\tIn this present case, Mr Chairman, people, especially women were given the worst treatment one can imagine, short of killing them, but having said this I wish to say that it is indeed an act contemplated by this Act.   \n\tOne might perhaps ask why not simply slap her around, why not kick her or why not shove her against the wall?   But it does appear that the whole object, Mr Chairman, was to instil fear.  The whole object was to make anybody afraid, or shall I use the term Mr Chairman, the whole object was to terrorise members of a political organisation which sought to overthrow the government of the day.  Whether this government was legitimate or not is now besides the point, but what was done, Mr Chairman is that terror was used, extreme fear was unleashed on people for two reasons.  \tOne, to gain information from them about their activities or the activities of members of Illisolomzi who might be in Ciskei or about the escape of Mr Charles Sebe from prison, or the people who assisted him to jump prison and the abduction of the Head of the Elite Unit, General Kwane Sebe.  \n\tThe other objective Mr Chairman, was to instil as much fear in the hearts of anybody who associated himself, sympathised with or was a member of this political organisation Illisolomzi, or the Ciskei Peoples' Rights Protection Party.\n\tPerhaps the difference would be in the methods used in instilling fear and terror, but I think the Committee will agree with me that we have lived through very terrible times. At some instances hit squads were used to mow down people, women and children in the name of the government.  In some instances women and children were killed in the name of the struggle.   \n\tAnd in the present case before this honourable Committee a man and women were tortured very severely, I readily concede, but EAST LONDON HEARING\tAMNESTY/E CAPE\nMR HOLE\t54\tADDRESS\nthis was still in the name of the government of the day, the government of President Lennox Sebe.\n\tIf one has a look at Section 20, Subsection 3(B) of the Act, the Act reads:\n\"Whether a particular act, mission or offence contemplated in Subsection 2 is an act associated with a political objective, shall be decided with reference to the following:   the motive of the person who committed the act, mission or offence\".\nI have already submitted Mr Chairman that this was to instil fear and to extract information for the government of the day and\nb)  the context in which the act, or mission or offence took place, and in particular whether the act, mission or offence was committed in the course of or as part of a political uprising, disturbance or event or in reaction thereto.\"\n\tClearly, Mr Chairman, there were treasonable acts being done in Ciskei, according to the laws of Ciskei at that time.  People were detained, a member and the Head of the Elite Unit, the son of the President was abducted and taken to Transkei, people claimed responsibility for detaining him, a neighbouring state was training troops to overthrow Ciskei, pamphlets were distributed by Illisolomzi in Ciskei, inciting and fanning the flames of revolution in Ciskei.   The Security Police of which these applicants were members had to act against this kind of conduct.\n\tRightly or wrongly, Mr Chairman, but what they did in my submission they did in reaction to acts of a political uprising or a disturbance.\n\tIf one had regard to Subsection 3(D) of Section 20 which enjoins us to look at the object or objective of the act, or \nEAST LONDON HEARING\tAMNESTY/E CAPE\nMR HOLE\t55\tADDRESS\nmission, or offence, and in particular whether the act, or mission, or offence was primarily directed at a political opponent, or state property or personnel or against private property or individuals.\n\tIn my submission, Mr Chairman, the acts of these people, the applicants, gruesome as they may have been, were directed against people perceived to belong to Illisolomzi or have association with members of Illisolomzi or agents of Illisolomzi.    Whether this information was correct or not, in my submission, does not affect the case either way.\n\tWhat we should look at, Mr Chairman, is the state of mind of the applicants at the time.  Whether they believed that these people had this information.  They have given evidence, Mr Chairman, to say there was a whole lot of information about Brig Simandla, the question about the key having been lost, which the Brigadier has also alluded to in his unsworn statement.   There was a question of the guard who was not posted at the tower.  There was a question of the guards who were disarmed, shortly before the assault on the prison and all these things, the \nrelations between Miss Msutwana, her sister and Gen Charles Sebe who has escaped from custody.   The information that the Elite Unit had that she was acting as an agent or a contact of Mr Sebe.  \tIn respect of Mrs Nomoy ...(intervention)",
