There was a message that we got that we were supposed to go there and I was one of the people who were there with Winile Veveza.\n\tWe waited for the person who called us.  Mabuti Biko then arrived and he said that we should go with him to town.  We went to town with him, with Winile Veveza.  When we arrived in town we went through Alice Street.  In Alice Street what happened is I stood outside next to the gate.  \n\tMabuti and Winile Veveza went inside.  When they were inside - when they were going inside Mabuti Biko said that we were there for an operation, we were there to take arms of firearms for the organisation.  I was expecting such a thing.  \n\tThey went inside and they kicked this white man and then they went inside.  When we were inside we searched the rooms, the whole house.  Whilst we were searching we heard a shot in one of the room inside the house.  When we heard that sound I continued searching.  \n\tAfter that I went to another room and I then saw Mabuti Biko taking out firearms from that room.  We finished that and then we left the place.  We arrived next to the river and he asked us whether we took something from the house.  He then searched us and he didn't find anything else.  We went to Zukile Biko.  When we arrived at Zukile Biko's place, Mabuti Biko then left.  He was going to meet with Tamsanqa Duma and he left us behind.  That is what I can say about the incident.",

In APLA - APLA was established inside the country in the form of smaller units of Poko(?) task forces.

Its briefing mandate was to defend the party internally and at times it was given extra duties like defending the party and we also using it in intelligence gathering.  Because as you are aware there is no organisation or any institution that can function and survive without intelligence and security.  \n\tSo it was very difficult at the time to use externally trained cadres to come and protect the party.  Then it developed to be APLA recruitment pool and later directly involved in combat.  \n\tAnother thing that I want to stress here is that the strategy of APLA was basically a liberation war.  What we referred to as the PAC and APLA as people's war.  And that people's war was based on the premise that ours is the struggle of the people as a whole, of the oppressed.\n\tI can say people's war is the involvement of the people in every front to wage the struggle, to destroy the settler regime.

That they were quite clearly acting on behalf of APLA, a publicly known political organisation and liberation movement which was engaged in a political struggle against the State at the time.\n\tMr Chairperson, I won't like to waste the time of this Committee.  You have heard the applicants.  They have told the Committee that they were given instructions to go to Mr Franciscato's house and kill Mr Franciscato and repossess arms and this instruction came from Mr Duma.  Mr Duma came and told the Committee that he indeed gave those instructions and that he got those instructions in his capacity as a commander then, of APLA.\n\tMr Chairperson, the applicants have told this Committee their roles, their respective roles in regard to this incident.  It is my humble submission that with regard to their roles they have made full and proper disclosure before this Committee.\n\tMr Chairperson, there is no doubt that the first applicants, Mr Biko and Veveza have previous criminal records.  There is no doubt about that.  And that they were related to various incidents regarding dishonesty. \tMr Chairperson, with regard, there is a difference with this one.  If one looks at all the incidents that they were involved in, none of them involved the taking of human life.  It was the first incident where a human life was taken.  ...[intervention]",
