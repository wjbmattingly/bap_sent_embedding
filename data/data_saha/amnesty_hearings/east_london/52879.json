There is general and full support for the Truth and Reconciliation process from all those whom we represent.\n\tThe opposition to this application, is advanced on the basis firstly that it is not evident from the applications which have been made available, that there has been a full disclosure of all the relevant facts and secondly, and perhaps more importantly, it is opposed on the basis that these applications do not relate to offences relating to an act associated with a political objective as envisaged by the Act.\n\tIt is on that basis that this application is opposed.",
