<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSHAYA:</span> No, I haven't seen him here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Was this Zukhuru his - what are his full names?  Is Zukhuru his full name or one of his name or is this a pseudonym?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSHAYA:</span> I do not know him that well.  Commander Joe Jongile would be the one who could give us those details.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> And then what did you use to travel to Port St Johns, did you use public transport of private transport?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSHAYA:</span> We were driving in a car that we normally used for security purposes at the office, the three of us, myself, comrade Mdlulwa and comrade Zukhuru.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Were you carrying any firearms with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSHAYA:</span> Yes, we were heavily armed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Having reached Port St Johns, what did you do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSHAYA:</span> On our arrival at Port St Johns, we reported at the ANC office there, and we met the Chairperson there and we were given the directions where the shooting was taking place, which is the school.  We proceeded in that direction and we found a person who guided us to the shooting place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Do you know that person's name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSHAYA:</span> No, I do not know that person's name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Is he not amongst the applicants who are here in respect of the incidents that took place at Port St Johns?</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSHAYA:</span> No, I haven't seen him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Proceed.  You then proceeded to the school?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSHAYA:</span> On our arrival at the school, as soon as we entered the gate, we heard gunfiring, they were shooting at our car.    There were already chaos and there were adult people because there was Voter Education that was going on.  There were lots of people in the school.  After having been shot at, we alighted the car and we took cover and - we took cover and we positioned ourselves appropriately.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Yes, and what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSHAYA:</span> The shooting continued and we could see from what direction it came from.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSHAYA:</span> We divided ourselves and we gave each other the task of evacuating all the adult people who were in the premises and to try and stop all this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Was there still this gunfiring?</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSHAYA:</span> Sorry?</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Was there still shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSHAYA:</span> Yes, the gunfiring was continuous.  Fortunately for us, there was a comrade who was residing in Port St Johns and they joined us in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> You say how many were they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSHAYA:</span> They were many in number, but the other one who was carrying a firearm, he is the one that we worked with closely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who is he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSHAYA:</span> I think he is present here in the hall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who is he, I am not asking if he is present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSHAYA:</span> I do not know his name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is he a fellow applicant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSHAYA:</span> Yes, he is a fellow applicant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who may that be Mr Mgidlana?</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> It is Guleni, Fundisele Guleni.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Guleni, Fundisele Guleni?</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> Could the applicant kindly bring the microphone closer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSHAYA:</span> We deployed ourselves and we fired back, and the firing was just going on continuously.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, carry on, what happened next?</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSHAYA:</span> Thereafter we heard that there was a soldier that was reported to be dead, and the people were evacuated and...</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you return fire?</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSHAYA:</span> Yes, we did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> You said the firing continued for some time (indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSHAYA:</span> The firing continued and we tried to suppress them, but they outnumbered us.   The process of evacuating the people was quite difficult, because we were trying to use backdoors and windows.  There were cars that were being shot at.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was the building, the school building, then being attacked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSHAYA:</span> Yes sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you had proceeded from the gate where you were shot upon, to the school building?</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSHAYA:</span> Yes, we managed because the terrain was bushy, so it was easy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay, carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSHAYA:</span> At about five o'clock in the afternoon, there were no more policemen and soldiers at that time, and when we realised that it was becoming dark, and the police Commander, he heard that there was shooting, he was coming from Umtata and we told him that he must ask his policemen to stop the shooting, but this continued an hour after I have told him, but we tried to retreat at about five o'clock, when all the people were all evacuated from the school premises and we decided to move away as our mission was accomplished or over.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why do you think the school was being attacked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSHAYA:</span> When we enquired as to what is happening because we did not know who was firing at who, but we knew that they were shooting from a Mr Mposelwa's house.  As we were firing, we could not fire back at that house because there were small children that came out of the house, of the age of 5.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I know that, but why were they attacking the school?  Was it just ordinary criminal reasons or political reasons or what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSHAYA:</span> It was for political reasons, because the ANC and the PAC were fighting in St Johns at that time.  It was not the first report that we got.</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were there ANC people in the - why do you say that the school was being attacked because there was a fight between the members of the ANC and the members of the PAC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSHAYA:</span> The Voter Education that was going on at that time, was conducted by the ANC.   Thus, I think that they wanted to disrupt the Voter Education that was going on.  I don't have any other reason that I can give.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you went to St Johns to do your duty as a result of an order from your Commander?</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSHAYA:</span> That is correct sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You say after an hour, after you reported to the police Captain, the shooting subsided as I understand it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSHAYA:</span> No sir, what I said is that after having spoken to the Commander at the police station, the firing continued.   Nobody came to try and stop it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you go to the police station?</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSHAYA:</span> Fortunately the police station was just behind us, and we saw the police, they took cover, they were just watching, they did nothing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I see.</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSHAYA:</span> The Station Commander drove, passing by with a van and we stopped him.  He was on his way back from Umtata.</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How many of your co-applicants were involved in that incident?  You have told us about Guleni and Mdlulwa.  Anybody else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSHAYA:</span> It is only the three of us, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Only the three of you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSHAYA:</span> Yes sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And those other comrades of yours that didn't come too close, do you know who they were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSHAYA:</span> No, I do not know sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Could there have been one of your co-applicants involved with that lot, who never came too close, but came to assist?</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSHAYA:</span> Please repeat your question sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Could there have been one of the co-accused that came in that group that didn't come too close to you?  Remember you said there at Port St Johns there were many comrades, only one who was armed, came very close, he was Mr Guleni.  I assume the others stayed further back.  Do you know Mr Poyo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSHAYA:</span> No sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And Mr Pato?  Do you know him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSHAYA:</span> No sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You say in any case, the three of you were in close vicinity of each other during that incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSHAYA:</span> That is correct sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay, carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Were there others who could have also participated, but whom you cannot identify?</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSHAYA:</span> Yes, there are.  There were many because there were elderly people and women, there was chaos and there were men who were also helping us out to carry the old people and helping through windows.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> You said that this firing was coming from the direction of Mr Mposelwa, one Mr Mposelwa's house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can you spell that, I cannot hear what you are saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> M-p-o-s-e-l-w-a.</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mp?</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Yes, Mposelwa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who was this person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> He says in his testimony that the firing was coming from the house of one Mr Mposelwa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just hold on, something is crossed here on the microphones.    Is English still on channel 2?  Okay, let us - I asked you who was Mr Mposelwa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Mposelwa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who was he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Can you tell us who Mr Mposelwa was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSHAYA:</span> Mr Mposelwa was a PAC member, a senior member of the PAC in Port St Johns.</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is it from that house from which there was shooting towards you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSHAYA:</span> That is correct, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How far is that house from the school?</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSHAYA:</span> There is just a fencing between the two buildings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can you show us now from the school building, let's say the school building is where you are, can you point out a position here in this room?  Can you do it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSHAYA:</span> The school wall might start ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Aikona, the school wall is where you are sitting, show us now where ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSHAYA:</span> Okay, the school wall might be where I am sitting, and Mr Mposelwa's house might be there by the door.</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Would the legal representatives agree with 15 metres?</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALUSI:</span> Yes Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you agree Mr Mgidlana?</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Yes Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSHAYA:</span> We were at an edge and we crawled towards the edge which was dividing the two premises.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is there anything more you want to say on this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSHAYA:</span> When we left in the evening, policemen arrived, or rather the army from the Special Force.  It was, there would have been three of them, and they told us that we have to leave because the government Forces have been arranged to come and monitor the situation.  That is when we withdrew, at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> During the whole incident, was anyone killed or injured, that is at the time when you were still engaged in the...</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He said they had heard later that a soldier had been killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSHAYA:</span> Yes, during the shooting, a soldier was shot.  We saw him being shot, because he had just told us that he was going to the PAC group and another man who was just walking passed, he was shot as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who shot that soldier?</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSHAYA:</span> He was shot by the PAC members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Have you been charged with this incident, or are charges pending in respect of this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSHAYA:</span> Are you referring to the shooting of the soldier?</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, that whole incident, any charges arising out of that incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSHAYA:</span> No sir, no charges.</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Any of your co-accused, do you know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSHAYA:</span> No sir, no policeman came to us.  The only thing that we saw the following day, were the casualties and the reports that there were Security Forces and that people were killed, and we did not know who might have died, but seeing that we realised that lives had been lost there, we decided to apply for amnesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you are not too sure whether you were the cause or any of your colleagues were the cause of those deaths?  You only know of one death, that is the soldier, and you know that he was killed from the firing from the PAC members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSHAYA:</span> That is correct sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Anything else you want to tell us about that incident or have you done with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSHAYA:</span> There is nothing else Your Honour other than the fact that people died.</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Let's proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE POTGIETER:</span> Tell us just, what were you using to shoot with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSHAYA:</span> I was carrying an AK47 rifle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE POTGIETER:</span> And the other one, Mr Mdlulwa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSHAYA:</span> I am not certain, but I was the only one who was carrying an AK47 rifle.  As to whether he was carrying an R4 or an R1, I am not sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Guleni?</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSHAYA:</span> It seems that he was carrying an Uzzi sub-machine gun.</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Did you aim at any object when you were shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Or any person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSHAYA:</span> We were crawling towards the fence.  Because of the bushy terrain and you could not see your target clearly, but to suppress them for the purpose of our mission, we wanted them to see that we were shooting them, but sometimes I would just be shooting openly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> was your AK47 on manual or on automatic?</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSHAYA:</span> I kept on changing it because I did not have enough ammunition, because we did not know what was the situation, therefore I kept on alternating the positions, manual to automatic.  And one other thing that happened there, that didn't - we did not shoot at the house because there were children who were coming out of the house.  Because we noticed later that this is actually a residential house, and there were shooting, but from all over the house.  They were shooting from inside the house, we were going to throw in handgrenades, but because of the presence of the children, I stopped them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> You never saw any bullet from your firearm striking any person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSHAYA:</span> No, but I had aimed at somebody who had just arrived with a car.   Whether I struck him, whether he fell or not, I could not tell, because I just fired and they would just return the firing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ... the next incident in which he is involved, or is that his ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> It is only this incident, Your Worship.</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MGIDLANA</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mgxaji?</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGXAJI:</span> Yes Judge, Judge so far the testimony profit by the applicant, doesn't seem to relate to ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> To your clients?</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGXAJI:</span> To my clients, but I am not too sure whether His Lordship may allow me to just ask one question relating to Guleni.</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is it - relevant to which act, incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGXAJI:</span> Relevant to the Mapipa case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, ask the question, let us see how ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MGXAJI:</span> Mr Matshaya, Mr Guleni is also the applicant before this Committee, in relation to the Mapipa murder case, right?  I want to find out if you know him, is he or was he a member of MK?</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE POTGIETER:</span> Don't touch this thing here, it is very sensitive on the headphones.  Switch it on again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSHAYA:</span> I know Mr Guleni.  I met him in Port St Johns.   I knew him as the member of the SDU in Port St Johns.</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you discount the possibility that he was a member of MK or is it that you just don't know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSHAYA:</span> As far as I am concerned, as a member of SDU, I don't draw that much difference from the MK because the SDU's would get their training from the MK people, therefore I don't know who to answer this question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> To differentiate?  Now let's put it this way, can you say whether he was trained outside the country or not?  Can you say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR MATSHAYA:</span> No, I don't think so.  I don't think so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that all Mr Mgxaji?</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGXAJI:</span> That is all, Judge, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MGXAJI</p>

<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALUSI:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson, I don't have any questions for this applicant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a>NO CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MALUSI</p>

<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I don't suppose you have any re-examination, Mr Mgidlana?</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> No re-examination Chair, thank you.</p>

<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mgidlana, I just want to ask you, in respect of this applicant, should we find that he was party of a group responsible for any crime at that incident, what would he be applying for, which offences?</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Judge it seems to me that it would be an offence of public violence, secondly I am not so certain ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But he was defending people, that is not public violence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Since there was a shooting ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Let's put it this way, at the end of the hearing, we are going to ask you to argue.  You can think about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Think about it, as it please you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Let's proceed.</p>
