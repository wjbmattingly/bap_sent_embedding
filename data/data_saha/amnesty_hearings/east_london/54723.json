For political reasons and it was for this reason that the initial statement was given. And My Lord will realise that it was complete lack of knowledge of any of the offences or applications against them. A complete denial and an alibi and My Lord will note from the amended statements made from the plea that - and then the rest is audible. The reason for this My Lord is that since February till now there has been a drastic change in the whole political set up. Particularly in relation to the Azanian People Liberation Army of which the accused are members. And they have now acknowledged this fact and explained in their plea that what they were doing on the day in question was taking part in an operation for the furtherance of their objective. And they consulted with higher authority and in the circumstance I personally have accepted reason for the difference in the pleas.\"\n\tThe question I would like to put to you now is that do you agree with this, what was said by your counsel at that point in time?",
