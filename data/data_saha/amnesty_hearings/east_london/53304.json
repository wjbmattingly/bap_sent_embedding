We were originally going to start off with another matter which we also have to hear, but because of some difficulty, one of the interested parties who was coming from overseas and who was only going to arrive her around noon, we started off with your matter so that we don't waste any time, but in the meantime the other matter is ready to proceed.  It is shorter than the matter that you're involved in and we are confident that we can dispose of it in a reasonable period of time.  We have discussed that this morning with your lawyers and have given the indication that we will more than likely do this in the course of the afternoon.\n\tThe other matter is ready to proceed, so we are going to let your matter stand down.  Ms Patel here still has some questions to ask of you, so we will, as soon as we've finished the other matter we will come back to your matter and we will then finish your evidence and we'll listen to your co-applicants in that application.  So at this stage we are going to let you stand down to allow us an opportunity just to complete the other matter, then we'll come back to you.",
