He told me that there are Brito vehicles that deliver the bread in the township and he even explained the route that they normally use.  On my own I monitored this Brito because they would use the Jakisa route through New Brighton.  He used to go to Sangoti.  Thus we targeted that place because it was very dark in the morning when they delivered.  My reconnaissance took six to seven days.  I used to monitor it daily in the morning whilst they were delivering the bread from Monday to Saturday and the following Monday.  \tAfter having monitored this I went back to Kleintjie where we met in number 74 in Agrie and I gave him the details as to how many occupants were normally in the car and what route they normally used.  He said that was correct, that's how he knew and we will see each other at a later stage.\n\tOn the evening before the mission he arrived again.  He went there and found that they were carrying a 7.65 mm firearm which was fully loaded and he handed me that pistol and he gave me two knives as well.  He instructed me to go and fetch that firearm so that the Africans must be liberated and he gave me a hug which a norm and thus we parted.\n\tAs time went on at about 10 o'clock Zozo arrived.  We were just discussing about the operation because he was already aware about the operation during the week.  We slept and woke up the following morning and we proceeded to Sangoti.",

Our target arrived as we'd expected with four occupants inside it.  It was the driver, a security guard and two van boys.  Three alighted the vehicle which was the security guard and the two van boys.  The security guard took cover and the two van boys proceeded to open the back of the van.  They took out the bread into the house where they were during the delivery.  At that moment we emerged and approached the security guard.  I was carrying this 7.65 mm gun and Zozo was armed with a knife.  I produced the firearm and I told him in Afrikaans that \"I want your firearm\".  He said to me that he does not have it.  Zozo advanced, approached him and went for his waist because he could see that he was actually having a firearm on his waistline.  There was a quarrel between them and he wanted to reach out for his firearm, he wanted to draw it and I told Zozo to give way and I shot him once.  He ran away down Sangoti.  We crossed the street and we just ran the opposite direction following him until he entered another house.\n\tOn our arrival at that house I instructed Zozo to wait at the gate for security reasons and I could see him lying on his back.  I went stealthily towards him and I found that he was still having his firearm.  I took that firearm and the ammunition, I retreated and we went back with Zozo to our normal meeting place which was number 74 Agrie Street. \n\tThereafter, we went our separate ways, me and Zozo. Later during the day at about 7 - 8 in the evening Kleintjie arrived and I gave him the report about the operation.  Thereafter I handed him over the 7.65 that he had given to me earlier on and a round of ammunition plus the .38 revolver that we had taken from the security and we parted.  That is the role that I played in this operation, your Honour.",

            "Pardon me, Mr Chairman, I didn't hear the question properly?\n\tIn October I met Kleintjie who sent me to the Transkei to go and collect two AK-47 rifles and pistols because there was a shortage of weapons.  I came back and handed over those weapons to him.  He told me that there is an operation that's supposed to be carried out which was an operation of repossession and he told that it was in Korsten and he gave me all the details about the operation and where it was.  There was a financial shortage and there were some things that were supposed to be bought.  I had to reconnoitre the area as part of procedure.  I did that for plus minus two weeks because I had to give a report, I did this in the mornings and in the afternoons twice a day.  I would monitor who opens the business in the mornings and I'll also check them late in the evening when they close.  I would give him the report of that reconnaissance daily.  He approved because that's exactly used to happen according to his knowledge.  A day before the operation he arrived at my new residential area which was in Sewu.  He arrived in the evening with three revolvers and he told me that he trusts me and he'll leave everything in my hands and he hugged me as usual and he left.\n\tI went to Changane to check the other combatants because that's where they stayed.  I told them that we had to meet in the morning.  I awoke up the following morning, it was Msinga who woke me up.  He was driving a car.  We left for Changane section from Sewu.  We found those gentlemen in Changane section and gave them a gun each and I told them that they must wait for Msinati because we're still going, proceeding to Motherwell.  I told them that I trust them, they must not let me down and I hugged them and we left with Msinati.  We were going to Motherwell.  We were going to take another repossessed car.  I took that car and drove to Boston and Msinati went back to pick up the other gentleman.  On my arrival at Korsten I parked the car and I went into a nearby shopping complex and bought myself a cooldrink.  On my way out I spoke to them.  I was talking in a way that no one could notice I was talking to them.",

After a few minutes they emerged running, carrying a bag of money, carrying the firearms, I went into the car and I asked them if everything went well.  They confirmed that and I drove off.  I noticed that there was a male person who was peering from upstairs because I noticed that I didn't actually tie that person up.  Two police vans came from Stanford Road and thus I decided to take an alternate route which Governdale.  I proceeded with Governdale Road until I got into a cul-de-sac and I realised that I had to drop this car, leave it because I had estimated that by now these people must have alerted the police.  When we got off we saw another car that was parked there which was a white van.  The driver was alighting the van.  I ordered Begus to point this gentleman with a firearm and we should take the car.  The driver of the car gave us the car keys and Impampi drove.  We drove down Governdale in the direction of Algoa Park.  We drove into another cul-de-sac again and we had to dump this car and we proceeded on feet running.  There were cars and taxis that were giving chase at that time and the traffic officers as well.  We ran in the direction of Algoa Park and we were crossing the veld and the people were also pursuing on foot as well.  I told the soldiers to start firing because these people were nearing, they were going to catch up with us.  They did that, they fired.  We left until we got to a swimming pool but just before that there was a helicopter in the vicinity already and many police vehicles.  We got into the swimming pool and the others hid to cover.  I just only went as far as the entrance.  I heard some firing after some time.  We were taken into a car, a car by the policemen who had arrested us, there were dogs as well.
