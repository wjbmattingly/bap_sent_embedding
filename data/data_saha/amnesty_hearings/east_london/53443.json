The first issue is that I want to place on record that we were formally instructed by the Legal Aid Board to act in this matter only during the course of last week.\n\tI also received the bundle of documents during the course of last week. I am based in Cape Town and the applicant is based in East London at present. I have consulted with the applicant for the first time yesterday through an interpreter. And I must also put on record that the person who acted as an interpreter was a prison warder who clearly showed his displeasure as acting as an interpreter during the consultation. So I'm just placing that on record for the benefit of my colleagues if there are certain issues which we omit when it might be for the reasons aforesaid. \n\tThe second issue which I wish to place on record is that although the formal application only mentions the names of Mr B Vaaltuin in respect of which amnesty is sought and another person, the applicant is in fact applying for amnesty for the murder of Penny Vaaltuin and the attempted murder of six others on which he was convicted in the Grahamstown High Court in 1990. And I have discussed the issue with the attorney for the victims as well as the Evidence Leader and they have indicated that they waive their right to take the point that the application is procedurally defective.",

It is coming now for a long time that issues such as instructions and attorneys' unwillingness to appear unless they're properly instructed and paid has led to delays in these applications. One would have hoped that those who appear for people would do so first and foremost to assist those people and secondly, for remuneration. I'm not pointing fingers at any particular body but it does present a problem of the work of the Amnesty Committee and it is to be hoped that my comments will spread to other people who represent these applicants.
