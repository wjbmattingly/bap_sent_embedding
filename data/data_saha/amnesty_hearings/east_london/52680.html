<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Bleki have you got any objections to the taking of the oath?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> No problem Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Will you stand please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">SIMPIWE LINCOLN BLEKI:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Be seated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> Mr Bleki in support of your application for amnesty you have completed the necessary application form and you have also submitted a detailed affidavit setting out the facts in this matter. Do you confirm that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> During the period 1992 to 1993 and more in particular at the time of this incident which took place on Sunday the 8th of August 1993 at Middelburg what was your position in the ANC at Middelburg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> I was a member of the African National Congress in Middelburg. I was also a member of the self defence unit. I was a political commissar.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> Is it correct that you were also responsible for the safety and security of members of the Middelburg community?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> The victim in this matter, Warrant Officer Leeman Maliti was he a policeman attached to the security branch section stationed at Middelburg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> Now you have in your affidavit given particulars of the problems and difficulties that you had with the victim. Could you very briefly just highlight what was the nature of the relationship between the victim and the greater part of the community in Middelburg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> I can do that. I am going to start and say that the relationship between the members of the community of Middelburg and the late Warrant Officer Maliti was not good at all. He was a security policeman. He used to fight against people who fought for liberation, people who were in the struggle for liberation. It was his job to oppress us, to take us to the police station, to beat us up. He would go to our homes as freedom fighters. He made it very difficult politically for us. He made it very difficult for us to reach our goals as freedom fighters in Middelburg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> In the past were there any actions taken by the community towards or directed at Warrant Officer Maliti?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> Yes there were a lot of attempts that they made or things that happened that showed the enmity between the community and Warrant Officer Maliti. People would toi-toi trying to show that we were not working together with him. His house was attacked. We tried to show him that we do not want him in our community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> And how did he react towards the feeling of the community as shown by the community?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> When he would see a group of people who would be toi-toiing towards him he would go out with his weapon or gun trying to protect himself. He would go raiding peoples houses' that he suspected that they contributed to whatever demonstration there was against him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> And is this something that was restricted to a very short period before the fateful day of August 1993 or was it something that was protracted over a number of years prior to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> This was over a long period of time before the 8th of August, the day of this incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> Did the victim in the course of those years also detain you personally?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> A number of times, a lot of times.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> And how did the victim treat you in the course of your detention?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> He was very oppressive, he beat me up. As a result I laid charges on him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> Are you aware that some of your co-inhabitants of the township there were also detained by the victim?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> Correct, that would happen I am aware. His oppression was not only directed towards me. It was anybody who was a freedom fighter in Middelburg at the time. He did not pick and choose. Youth, elderly people, even old ladies, reverends as well he would arrest.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> And the way that the victim treated the detainees was this the subject of general discussions there in Middelburg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> Yes it was terrible his attitude towards the community, we would talk about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> Would it be correct to describe the situation as a situation where the community in general was angry with the victim?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> That is absolutely correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> Did anybody lose his life as a result of the actions of the victim?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> Yes, a lot of people lost their lives because of the victim.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> In the papers supporting your application you refer to an incident when Chris Hani died and you make reference to the actions of the victim in response to the death of Chris Hani. Could you just elaborate on that? How did the victim respond to Chris Hani's death? On page 22 of the documents there is reference to this at the bottom. I believe the applicant cannot hear the interpreter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When Mr Hani died did the victim display any peculiar response to this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> He was very glad, very happy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> What did he, how did he express his happiness at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> He walked up and down the streets with his weapon, remarks that he would pass that the communist is dead, he is now at peace.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> And how did the community respond to the reactions displayed by the victim?</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> That triggered a whole lot of hatred towards the late Mr Maliti.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> Is it correct that the culmination of all of these actions lead to a earnest request directed at the victim to leave the township and to move to the built-up area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> And did he pay any attention to this earnest request by the community for him to leave?</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> No he did not take heed at all. He did not care about peoples' rights. He did not listen to anything that people said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> So eventually what decision did you take in regard to the victim?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> As I was also a victim to him and I could not rest in Middelburg because he was after me all the time. And also seeing members of my community in such oppressive situations I then decided to shoot him and to kill him. That is a decision that I took as a result of the situation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> How did you believe would this action by you which you intended taking assist the community in the struggle in which they found themselves?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> First of all Mr Maliti worked for the security forces in Middelburg. We had our own leaders that he was after and oppressing. The community would gain a lot. Especially our leaders who played a major role in bringing about the transformation in our country. Killing him would bring peace in Middelburg. Especially in the transformation towards democracy. So that democracy would come in a peaceful manner, without our leaders being oppressed in Middelburg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> And was this decision which you decided or which you took was it a decision which you had taken yourself or was it a decision which you took in consultation with the executive of the ANC at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> I did try to talk with other members, leaders of the African National Congress in the community. I also knew that they knew a lot about protection in our community. They were also aware of Mr Maliti's actions. Could the speaker please repeat the last sentence? I did try to tell them how I intended to deal with Mr Maliti.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> And was there any reaction from those with whom you shared this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> They were not against my views. They did not give me an order either to continue. I took initiative to deal with Mr Maliti.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> You were not seeking an order or authorization, it was solely a decision taken by yourself to deal with the victim in order to achieve the objective?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> I did not want their order necessarily. I just was sharing with them the decision that I had taken against the victim who was very cruel towards the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> In executing this decision of yourself you required assistance and in doing so you approached Mr Oscar Nongongo, that is the second applicant in this matter, who was resident in Port Elizabeth. Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> You had got to know Mr Nongongo over the years as a fellow comrade?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> And was he also detained with you on occasions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> Yes there was a time when we were both arrested together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> When you approached Mr Nongongo was he agreeable to assist you in the execution of this plan?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> Yes he fully agreed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> You then proceeded in making arrangements for the execution of this plan, eventually proceeding to Middelburg on Saturday the 7th of August 1993 in order to observe and scout the area where the victim was staying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> Throughout the period that you intended executing this plan was your aim directed solely at the victim Mr Maliti or did you not care whether other innocent bystanders were also injured in possible crossfire?</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> This was solely directed at Mr Maliti, nobody else. That we were certain of.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> So you went to great lengths to ensure that you would get the victim on his own?</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> As you have set out the observations which you held as it is set out in your affidavit it eventually resulted in you and the second applicant approaching the house of the victim on Sunday morning the 8th of August 1993?</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> And on entering the house of the victim, where did you find the victim?</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> He was sitting on a chair looking towards us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> And what happened then, very briefly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> We got to the house, we knocked. I then heard his voice. Oscar was just ahead of me. I knew according to our plans that Oscar would not know this man. I then tried to alert him. When we realised that it was him we shot at the man. We then heard somebody crying in the background. A lady's voice. As our intention was not to shoot anybody else or to injure anybody else we only wanted Mr Maliti we tried to shoot him as much as we could and then we ran off.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> At the time when you shot at the victim was your intention to kill him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> And did both you and your co-applicant, Oscar shoot at Mr Maliti?</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> Yes, both of us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> After having shot Mr Maliti you proceeded to a so-called hiking spot outside of Middelburg where you intended to leave the area in an arranged taxi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> But you were arrested before you could leave the area. Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> That is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> You were eventually charged in the regional court at Middelburg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> And how did the community in general react to you being charged there in the regional court?</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> What I could say is that the community was relieved in what happened to the victim. I say this because of the way they supported us the first time we went to court. I remember very well because even the schools in Middelburg showed support. To me they were showing that they were supportive of what we had done.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> And were you also assisted by the provision of defence counsel to appear on your behalf at the trial?</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> You were eventually convicted of attempted murder and offenCes under the Arms and Ammunition Act and sentenced to an effective ten (10) years imprisonment, which you are presently serving?</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Which particular offences under the Arms and Ammunition Act?</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> It is possession of an unlicensed firearm and possession of ammunition. Is that correct Mr Bleki?</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Unlawful possession of the ammunition?</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> That is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Wait just before you get. And those two offenses were, he was separately charged for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a>(Could the judge please speak a little bit louder?)</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay. Those two offences, that is the possession of unlicensed firearm and the unlawful possession of ammunition you were charged separately for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So in total you had three charges and you were convicted of all three?</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> In respect of the possession of the unlicensed firearm and the possession of ammunition without having in your possession a licensed firearm, could you have executed this plan if you did not have access to this firearm and ammunition?</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> I could not have.</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> So although they were separate charges it was all required for the purpose of achieving this objective of eliminating the victim?</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> As far as your co-applicant is concerned he was not present at the time when your case was finalised?</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> He was subsequently convicted and sentenced in your absence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you still in prison? Are you still serving this sentence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> Yes correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And your co-applicant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> Him as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How long have you served already?</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> I was sentenced in 1994, the 25th of May.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you appeal against that conviction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> No I did not appeal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you started serving your sentence from May 1994?</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And do you know when your co-accused starting serving his sentence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> I am not sure about the date.</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Wessels do you perhaps know from the</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a>record?</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> Yes, the co-applicant was sentenced on the 27th of June 1995. And he was sentenced to an effective eleven (11) years imprisonment. However he is also serving other sentences, lengthy other sentences.</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I am only concerned about this application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I see in his application Mr Wessels, unless I have not read this properly, that he did not apply for escaping.</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> No, that is correct. The application is only in respect of the attempted murder and the offenses under the Firearm Act.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And do you not argue that the escape is part and parcel of this whole escapade?</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> Mr Chairman no. He has a peculiar situation involving other matters and I will be, it will be difficult to argue that the escaping was solely related in respect of this matter. So I will not pursue that line of argument.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I see. So the application is only made in respect of attempted murder and the offenses under the Arms and Ammunition Act?</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> Indeed so on behalf of both these applicants.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And second applicant is aware of this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> I am sure, well his application is only in respect of those matters. And I think that is the whole reason why it is only framed in that nature.</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Thank you, through you Mr Chairperson may I perhaps ask one question? He was sentenced to eleven (11) years. Is this eleven (11) years only for attempted murder, unlawful possession of arms and ammunition? Has it got nothing to do with the escaping?</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> No he was not charged for escaping in the regional court. He was only sentenced to ten (10) years imprisonment for the attempted murder and a total of one year imprisonment for the offences under the Arms and Ammunition which was ordered to run concurrently with another suspended sentence in another matter. So in total if he was sentenced to an effective eleven (11) years imprisonment. That is the second applicant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a>	Mr Bleki if there is nothing further then I just want to return to certain aspects. You already lodged your application for amnesty in 1996 and the hearing of your application for amnesty was set down for August 1997, that was last year. But because of certain difficulties with the investigation by the investigation team your application was not heard in August of last year. Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> And you are presently by bringing this application still waiting for this whole matter, this is the only matter which is keeping you in prison?</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> I want to deal with your present relationship with Mrs Maliti, the victim's wife who is present here in the audience. Is it correct this morning she also came to you, to come and greet you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> That is correct. When she was walking past me she greeted me and I greeted right back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> And the victim's children, do they still attend school together with your younger brother or brothers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> Yes they went to school together but now I hear that my little brother is in Cape Town. They are no longer at school together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> And what is your information about the children of the victim visiting your house in your absence now that you are in prison? Do they come and visit your house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> Yes I would hear that Mr Maliti's children would go to my house. They are friends with my siblings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> And do you have any feelings or emotions which you wish to express in regard to the family of the victim?</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> Yes. I would be very grateful if I had the opportunity to say something.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> Please proceed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think if you want to make your peace with anybody then you can do it after the hearing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> As the Chairman pleases. There is one matter which Mrs Maliti has raised and that is that she has mentioned that after the shooting of her husband, the victim there were rumours doing the rounds there in Middelburg that she was in some way connected with the planning of the shooting of her husband. Now can you respond in regard to those rumours that did the rounds?</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> I know Mrs Maliti, she used to teach me. In connection with this case she did not take part at all. She never really spoke to me about my political activities or my differences with her husband. She did not play any role in this matter at all. I have nothing against her or her children. But I could say that I am very sorry about what happened that we shot Mr Maliti.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The question is, did she have anything to do with your activities relating with the incident with her husband?</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> No, not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> And she and your co-applicant, Oscar did not even know each other. So as far as your co-applicant is concerned she had nothing to do from his point of view with the execution of this plan. Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> Mr Chairman those are the facts in support of the application for both these applicants which we wish to tender. The details of the application is set out in the documents. If there is nothing in particular that any of the committee members would like to hear us on, then we will stand by what has now been tendered.</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mapoma have you got any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman I have no questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson perhaps one or two questions. Mr Bleki after the incident how did your organisation, the ANC react to the incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> I tried to get in touch with the comrades after the incident giving them all the details what happened. All I had received was their support.</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Are they also supportive of your application for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> Yes there is also a report that they have got in support of my application for amnesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> Mr Bleki in what capacity were you acting when you launched the attack on the deceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> First of all I was the political commissar working in the security department. I took my own initiative as I already said to plan to kill Mr Maliti after I had spoken to the leaders in the community of the ANC. I fully believed that if I had said to them as I said that I was going to kill him they were not against this. I was also convinced that the community would be glad because Maliti was the enemy to the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> Did you harbour any personal grudge or feelings of enmity towards Mr Maliti?</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> No there was no personal grudge. There was nothing personal about this. However in a political context there definitely was enmity.</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> So you were not intending to settle a personal score with Mr Maliti?</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> No there was no personal scores to be settled.</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> And do I understand you correctly from a political point of view you had regarded Mr Maliti as part of the enemy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> I thought that he was a very dangerous enemy in the community because a lot of times I saw these things with my own eyes that he did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">ADV POTGIETER:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was the victim the ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> Not the only one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was he the only one that committed atrocities like torture and so forth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> Yes I think, yes he was the only one who committed these atrocities. (Could the judge please come closer to the mike?)</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why was he singled out for such treatment and not other members of the security police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> If I remember correctly the security police in Nonzame, Middelburg he was the one who gave orders, who was more superior. He gave orders that led to the unrest. He was the cruel one who gave these orders.</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now the struggle you refer to, I think that is well documented. It ranged from housing, education and all these oppressive laws that kept our people down, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was the victim not aware that, that struggle or the success of that struggle would benefit even him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> He did not see the future. He did not think that the struggle would be successful. He thought that he was in a respectable place, he was armed all the time, he was protected personally and his job was to be oppressor and permit all the atrocities. He was free according to his view. He did not care about anybody elses liberation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Despite the possible benefit to him did that make you more angry that would normally be the case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a>(Could the speaker please repeat the question?)</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Despite the possible benefits of the success of the struggle and him being a hurdle to that, did that make you more angry than would otherwise be the case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> Could you repeat the question please Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Given the possible benefits of the success of this struggle did the fact that he a possible beneficiary of that success, did it make you more angry that he was presenting such a hurdle to this struggle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">MR BLEKI:</span> I would not be angry if the struggle would be successful and we both would benefit from the liberation. He would not have contributed in any way. I contributed to it and I am glad and there are no oppressive ways in Middelburg any more.</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes thank you. Are there any other witnesses Mr Wessels?</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> Mr Chairman there is just the second applicant. He is anxious to testify as well. Although the need for him to testify is questioned. His application is fully before the committee. May I just have a brief word with the other applicant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Wessels you can tell him that he can rest assured that we will treat him equally on the evidence that we have before us. Other than that is there any other evidence you would like you would like to place before this committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> There is no other evidence that I wish to present at this stage. Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you. Mr Mapoma is there any evidence you would like to place before us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Mr Chairman there is no other evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Wessels we do not intend to call any other witnesses or obtain any other evidence. Is there any points you want to make before we close this matter for the time being until we can give a judgment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman. Mr Chairman very briefly it is my submission that this application by both applicants conform with the requirements of the Act. It was clearly an act which was executed with the intention to benefit the struggle at the time. It is clearly a political objective which they intended to achieve. And it will certainly fall within the ambit of the definition of a political objective as set out in Section 22(a) of the Act. More than that there is nothing that I wish to elaborate on. Except there is anything in particular if the committee would like to hear me on. But viewed objectively everything points to a clear act with a political motive to achieve a specific objective which would have benefitted the whole community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And for which you suggest that amnesty be granted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> For both applicants. May I just mention as it appeared from the evidence that as far as the first applicant is concerned the finalisation of this application has a specific relevance in respect of his freedom. It will not specifically affect the second applicant. But the first applicant has been in custody for many years already and so if in some way or another the committee could give preference to this application in particularly as far as Mr Bleki is concerned that will be mostly appreciated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You are aware of the fact that we do not intend to waste more of his time. If we refuse that is the end of the matter. If we grant it, it is merely a recommendation to the state president.</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> That is so, no we understand that. As long as it can be given some sort of preference. Any preference will be valued by Mr Bleki in particular.</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Wessels our committee treats all applicants with preference. (LAUGHS) Mr Mapoma is there anything you would like to point out to us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Thank you Chair, I find nothing Sir to point out. I may just mention Sir that from the side of the victims I do not have much Chairperson to raise in objection to these applications by the applicants. Thank you Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes we will adjourn and we hope to be able to make a decision as soon as humanly possible. We will adjourn.</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
