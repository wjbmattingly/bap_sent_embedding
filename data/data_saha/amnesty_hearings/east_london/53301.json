Chairperson, for the benefit of the people who don't have the affidavit, I will read the affidavit if that's the case and go through it, thanks.\n\tThe affidavit by Mr Dolo reads thus:\n\"I, the undersigned, Pila Martin Dolo, do hereby make an oath and say that I'm the applicant in the undermentioned incidents, the facts to which I depose are true and correct and within my personal knowledge unless the context states otherwise.  I was born in Uitenhage in KwaLabushe Township and grew up in the Eastern Cape.  I was born 29 years ago and unmarried.  I left school in 1989 doing standard nine and left the country to Botswana the same year.  I joined PAC through Azania in 1984 and joined Apla in exile in 1989.  As Apla operative, my general instructions from the Apla high command was to persecute the armed struggle with all means against the racist minority regime which was undemocratic and oppressive.  The said armed struggle was in essence a guerrilla warfare during which we as Apla cadres had to seek and attack the bastions and minions of the then aforesaid regime.  The ultimate objective of PAC and Apla was not only to topple the then racist minority regime but to eventually return the land to the majority of the African people.  The bastions and minions of the then erstwhile regime were in terms of Apla perspective the members of the South African Defence Force, the members of the South African Police and Reservists in general, the farmers as they belonged to commando structure, over and above the fact that they occupied the farms from which we had to drive them away from so as to widen our territorial operation and base which was aimed at eventually consolidating, liberated and repossessed land.  The White homes which were garrisons of apartheid.\n\tMy general instruction was to seek, identify and attack the enemy who was seen in the context of the above bastions and minions of the regime and also to train other cadres and command them in whatever operation that is being embarked upon.  \n\tFicksburg House Attack - In consequence and in pursuit of the above stated objective during on or about the 4th December 1992 I commanded a unit of Apla cadres that launched an attack in a certain house...\"\nMr Chairperson, as I indicated that it will be heard now, the change because it was not the same house he attacked, was attacked by the unit which was led by Mr Kgotlhe, but they attacked some of the houses which were in that area same night.",

We were a unit of three.  It was myself as a commander armed with R4, Roger armed with pistol and Jabu armed with revolver and we also had a stick grenade.  We took taxi to this area and it was after there was a report that there's a patrol in that no other attacks would take place, we arrived during the day and we made reconnaissance and we waited until it was at night.  We went there on foot and we jumped the fence of the farm and advanced to the house.  Myself and Roger were to launch the attack and Jabu was to act as our security.  When we arrived there was light in another room and the other one was dark.  I deployed Roger on the dark room for him to throw grenade.  Myself I went to the room which had light on, the grenade was thrown and I started shooting and others followed suit.  We retreated whilst shooting and we withdrew to our RV area which was the Lesotho mountains where we waited before the attack.  I subsequently learned that a person died in this attack.  I am presently awaiting trial in regard to charges that are sequel to the above stated evidence.  The charges are murder on the 19th December 1992 at Dunside Farm of Leon Pretorius, attempted murder on the 10th December 1992 at Ficksburg by-pass upon Otto Coetzer firing an automatic machine gun on a motor vehicle wherein he was seated.  I respectfully submit that my application complies with the requirements of the act and that I have made full and proper disclosure of my involvement in the abovementioned operations.\"\nChairperson, as been indicated by Chairperson I'll lead the applicant then to these corrections.

Within a two weeks period prior the attack we have a liaison with Mr Mtate and then he asked me to go to Lesotho to help him there.  Then I went to Lesotho.  Whilst I was there at Lesotho I was stationed at - I forget the name of the place, but closer to - not far away from Ficksburg on the side of Lesotho.  I was there for one week and a couple of days prior the attack.  Mtate brought the guns and ammunition and the grenades and then we planned the attack and we decided that we were going to divide ourselves in two units, one unit headed by myself and the other unit headed by him.  Then we went to the side of South Africa.  After we crossed the river we then divided ourselves into those respective units.  My unit was leading the other unit.  We went closer to the mentioned house.  I went to a third house from that house and then I waited for his unit to reach that house.  We were also having information that all those houses around South African border closer to Lesotho were security personnel houses, they were after all acting as the first line of defence so as Apla and as our politics of the PAC that the police and the army were the pillars of apartheid and then that they wanted to be targeted.  So the question of hitting that house was not specifically planned that we have to hit directly that one.  We were there to attack anyone with the information we had was that all those houses were there were of security personnel's houses.\n\tSo the unit of Mtate attacked the house mentioned and mine attacked the third house from that one from the left hand side.  With my unit, I was myself and Roger, I was armed with an R4 and a rifle grenade.  Roger, I'm not sure what he was armed with but I think it was pistol, if not it was an Uzi which was a sub-machine gun.  He was also having the grenade with him, an M26.  He didn't use it in that house.  After all, the main attack was going to be launched by the unit of Mtate.  I was to see what was happening and then we attack any house whilst they were attacking if there was nothing else of any kind of counter-attack. \n\tSo we retreated.  Whilst we were retreating, there was a counter attack and then we went to the road, the main road.  At the main road there was a bridge.  We rushed ourselves to the other side of the bridge.  At the other side of the bridge that was then that I launched the rifle grenade and thereafter there was a car or then the cars that keep on passing the road but there was one car which we suspected to be of reinforcement.  That was the one whereby I instructed Roger to throw the grenade to it but he missed the car with the grenade and there were also some shots which we fired to the car and thereafter we retreated to the Lesotho side.",

Our mission politically was to drive them out of those farms then militarily it means we have to execute them in such attacks, by attacking them so there was no specific reason but from the military point of view, when you did an operation, you go for reconnaissance then you have to hit the enemy where he relaxes, you have to take the enemy by surprise.  So as I mentioned that prior the day of the attack there was a media statement from the Minister of Defence or the Minister of Police during that time who uttered such a statement that there will be no more other attacks against farmers, specifically in that area so we carry out the operation to show the enemy that we can do, we can continue with the armed struggle, nothing will stop us and secondly, if we were to carry out such operations in such a situation, we then have to go and look for targets, of which we will see them as will be very effective for such an operation and then it will be easy for us to carry out such attacks so that was then we come across such a farm.",
