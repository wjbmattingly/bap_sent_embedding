We put out arms in a bag, we moved to the Highway terminus, we boarded a taxi going to Mount Ruth.  This taxi carries about five people and we too were five.  When we embarked it was full, the driver came an he drove.\n\tAlong the way to Mount Ruth there was a place that used to be a nursery where people buy pot plants and trees as you are facing Mount Ruth.  We told the driver to stop and alight from the car, truly he did so because he saw the guns we had pointing at him.  \n\tOur own driver tried to drive the car but it would not start.  We then called the driver back to come and drive for us.  We then proceeded to Da Gama.  When we got there we noted that the bus had already gone into the yard.  We turned back.  \n\tWe used a black road behind the railway line going to that intersection going to the Nahoon Dam that joins the road we were using at the freeway.  We stopped there waiting for that school bus that carries school kids.  It did not arrive.  We then realised that our time might have been against us.  \n\tDuring that process a panel van Volkswagen old kombi arrived, it had two white people who were men.  As it was at the stop sign stopping there, Africa Kid Andile George alighted and shot at the minibus or kombi.  As that process was unfolding we saw a black man who had been hit from behind.  \n\tHe ran trying to go to Mdantsane station.  We followed Kid so that he could come back into the car so that we could leave.  We left the car at six about works and we gave the driver about R20 and told him to leave.

When we got to the highway trying to get transport we realised that instead of highjacking a car let us use a taxi going to 14.  We boarded this taxi with other people.\n\tPeople were alighting along the way, along the way.  When the driver was alone with us we pointed our guns to the driver and told him, commandeered the taxi in essence.  The driver drove according to our instructions.  When we were about near the corner of the old deport that is the no more a depot, a driver saw an oncoming kombi.  \n\tOur driver went into that one, drove his kombi into this other one.  We also ran out of the car afte he had left the car and we went through the,  near to the depot.\n\tWe went over the depot, next to the depot.  That's where we saw a Ford Sierra that was a station wagon.  It had stopped in a house that was a shebeen.  We resolved to go and try to get that Ford Sierra from that house.  We went in, myself, Africa Kid.  I cannot remember the third person. \n\tWe forced the people to lie down and asked who the driver of the car was.  He was pointed out and we demanded the keys and he told us the keys are at the room.  We went with him, me and Africa Kid, to that room.  There was one Africa at the door.  In the room we told him that we want keys and he told him that we want keys.  \n\tSomeone who was a police was there.  We told him: \"Guy we know you are a policeman but we don't want you to disturb us\".  Indeed he gave us the keys but because we had seen this policeman we kind of realised we would not reach our destination.  Let us take this one so that they cannot follow us from behind thinking that this one may be hurt, the original driver of the car.  Indeed we took him to the car.  \n\tAt the yard of the house me and himself, he reversed the car out of the ...[indistinct].  Other Africans also came and we then left.  We forced him out of the car near about Berlin.  We left him there and we came back to Mdantsane and we filled with petrol at Mobil and we went to town intending going to the bar at the station in town but we went via Cambridge.\n\tBut when we were passing the Highgate Hotel we noted that the Highgate Hotel was full, kind of there was a disco thing on.  We went to make that u-turn at the station, railway station and we came back.  The car was now facing Mdantsane.  Africa Dumisane Ncamazana was at the side of the hotel, he prepared the rifle grenade and he hit.  \n\tI do not know what the driver did what, perhaps he may have been loose with his clutch control and the car moved a bit and the rifle grenade hit the wall and we then left.",

            "The following day it was a Saturday, we awoke and left to see another Africa Sipho Fitjane at six.  We stayed there the whole day.  Late we returned to my house and slept at three, the place is at three.\n\tThe following morning, that is on the Sunday, we left trying to find a car.  Late night that same night on Sunday we found a car.  A gentleman was conversing with two ladies in a Honda Ballade, an old Honda Ballade.  Other Africans passed and myself, Luvuyo our dirver we returned and I pointed the driver to alight.  Luvuyo took the car and he went to the other Africans.  I also followed after he got to those other Africans.  We boarded the car and left to go to three.\n\tWe hid the car at a place so that we could see it from my house, we slept.  The following morning on the Monday, that was the 28th of March, TNT left and Luvuyo our driver and collected the car.  We waited for them near Gobusane.  We boarded the car, slowly we went to Da Gama.\n\tAt Da Gama - we got there early, we passed - I cannot remember whether it's the second, first turn right, we turned waiting for the bus in order to see it appearing so that we could go behind it.  That did not go according to plan because there was a car between ourselves and the bus.  We went behind it following the bus and that car.  \n\tAs the bus is required to stop because of cars moving past before going into the gates we had the chance to pass the bus and having resolved to hitting it with the rifle grenades.  But we then discovered that no, this rifle grenade cannot be used because the distance is too close.  There was this ultacation: let it be it with the rifle grenade or no, let it be hit by rifles.  \n\tUltimately Kid and TNT alighted and hit these guns that they shot at the bus.  After they had shot at the bus it was difficult for us to alight because we discovered that there were people that were hitting back.  It was only later that we discovered that it was security guards who were escorting the bus and those waiting at Da Gama, they hit at us.  We did not know because our commander did not tell us that the bus was being escorted by security guards.  They hit back but ultimately we got the chance to alight and leave that car.  It was myself and Africa Dumisani.  \n\tThe driver was left behind but he also alighted.  These two Africans who alighted first were fighting, Africa Kid was hit.  During that process I saw Africa TNT falling.  As the shooting was still going on I heard the helicopters swirling around.  I knew that the helicopter was going to overpower us now.\n\tAs Africa Dumisani was hitting back at these Africans, I mean Afrikaners, I saw that these two Africans who had fallen were also still shooting and I told the Africans: \"Africans this helicopter is going to give us problems.  You cannot run away, you cannot go back to the car because the car is already damaged and they are shooting so much that we cannot use that car.  Africans you must run away but we cannot leave you like this you see.  Africans I'm going to hit you now, shoot  you\".\n\tThe African said: \"No, don't shoot us, we are going to fight back.  If we see that it is too hard we are going to hit and kill ourselves\".  Ultimately I ran away.  I do not know whether Dumisani and Africa who was the driver ran to whatever direction.  There's a small path there moving from this railway line going to Da Gama, I used that road.  \n\tI saw a coloured man on his knees.  I saw that he was afraid and he begged me not to shoot him.  I told him: \"No, I'm running for my own business\" and I passed him.  At that time I was having a 7.65 and the rifle grenade that was in my lumber jacket.  As I was passing that railway line it fell, I could not take it.  I ran on past the graveyard at Mdantsane and went to two, that's where I got clothes to change.  Went on to other Africans.  I found other clothes to change.  \n\tI went on to another Africa, he gave me money.  I told him that I need to go to King William's Town.  They told me: \"There are two other ama Africa you're moving with, we are told that money has been asked for them because they had been injured\".  I asked for money to go to King William's town and they gave me the money.  I told him to keep my gun as I'm going to King William's Town, I could come and collect it after, knowing that I'm going to Butterworth.  \n\tI went to Butterworth, getting there I went to ...[indistinct] Mamma, the restaurant in town.  I entered through the front, bought drinks and tobacco.  I asked Mtutuze and they said they do not know - I asked from other ladies and they said they do not know where Mtutuze was, I must go back and check the flats there.\n\tAt the back I found other Africans, Nge, Subusiso and others.  I asked Africa: \"Where is Matura\"? and they said: \"No, we do not know Africa\".  And I asked: \"Where is Africa JJ\"?, they said: \"Perhaps he's at work, you can go and check him at work\".  I did not go to his work, I went straight to the base.\n\tI found other new ama Africa coming from Cape Town.  I talked with them, conversed after having greeted them and then I took this base commander and said to him: \"It think you must accompany me to go to town so that we can check this Africa JJ\".  \tOn our way to town we met policemen from Transkei moving with African Tona who was driving for us during the Bahai attack.  He was leading the police, that's how we were then arrested.  When we got to the top, as we were walking on foot we saw JJ and all the other Africans whom we had met in town and others in other places.  We were all arrested and we were beaten at the barracks.  From there we were taken to Umtata to the police station Fort Gail.  We did not know the reason for our arrest.  I did not know the reasons and others said they did not know.  Clearly I did not know the reason because that was the first time I got there, I was new around there.\n\tThree days after our incarceration at Fort Gail police station we were taken to Doctor Malinga at Umtata near the rank by the police.  When we left Doctor Malinga they put us at Wellington prison, that's where I got a chance to tell JJ about what happened at East London.  I told him everything about what happened in East London.",

            "It was because we then later noted that what our Africans had told us was not true, clearly they were selling us out know.  For example when we made those amensty applicantions by Mr Mbanja from King William's Town he said we must make application for the Bahai Church attack because it was still on trial and we did not do so.\n\tBut what happened, when we saw Ntonga and Jimmy Jones, that they want to sell us out - we were still going to the lower Court in Mdantsane being represented by Mr Ntonga as he's an attorney working for the PAC. One day as we were in prison we were called as people \twere being visited and we met a lady and a gentleman saying they are coming from the Legal Aid Board at Mdantsane and we asked them: \"What is the problem\"? and they said they want to provide us with an attorney for the case we are going to appear for at the Supreme Court and I said: \"No, Sisi, who told you we do not have an attorney because if you are saying you are coming from Mdantsane, at the Legal Aid Board at Mdantsane you are supposed to know that our attorney is Mr Ntonga\".   \n \tWe then realised, okay these ladies cannot just come here, there is something Mr Ntonga has said to them perhaps he had told that - maybe he's not representing us anymore.  Clearly these people are coming from East London and when they come from the Courts at East London they must know that we are being represented by Mr Ntonga.  And then we realised that he has something wrong with him.  \n\tIt did not stop there, Mr Mbandazayo came there very hurriedly.  After we had eaten our supper at about three they were about to close there and he said: \"Africa let us make applications for the Bahai attack because we had not done so\", we said: \"Okay\".  He called me, Mxzesiko, Dumisani Ncamazana, Oupa Jlomo and another Africa, I cannot remember his name.  He called us hurriedly so.  He talked in his cellular phone and said: \"Wait for these people, I'm coming right now\", and he said to us: \"Africans I'm in  a rush, please sign here.  I know this case, I'm going to fill everything else in at my office\".   \n\tWe though okay, the African knows this case.  For that matter we had been represented by him in the beginning when we were sentenced.  He left.  I then realised there is something I do not understand with this African.  Some day another African said: \"This case of Bisho we must not go on trial, we must simply go to the Truth Commission, there is no reason to go on trial with this case\".  We saw it the same way, it did not make any problem.\n\tWe had no attorney for some time, until we were represented by Sally Corlett and she said she can represent us in Court, okay.  We gave her what we were going to say in Court.  Another Africa came, Mbandazayo.  He had seen in the newspapers that we were going to be represented by Sally Corlett in Court and he asked them: \"How can you ask to be representated by a white person while you know that we around Africans\".  For that matter I have told you that you must not go on trial with this case\".  \n\tWe responded by saying: \"Africa, you told us we must sign those forms without us having filled them in and we realised later that you said, we realised later ...[intervention]",

            "The forms that we signed were those that we couldn't read, the ones that said we were not, we were against being represented by Sally Corlett plus those he said we must simply fill in our signatures as applications to the Commission and he would fill everything in in his office about the case as he knew everything about it.\n\tLater we thought: no we want this case to go on trial because we realised something is wrong now as they do not want this case to go on trial.  We felt we must go on with this case.  In Court at Bisho before this case we had a serious altecation with Mr Ntonga and Mr Mbandazayo and they said we must not go on trial with this case because if we go on they are going to represent us.  \n\tWe refused that they must represent us.  We had a serious altecation and they said we are not going to get through otherwise we are not going to even appear before the Commission: \"All Africans are going to be angry with you for having been represented by a white person in our presence\" and we said: \"No, we don't care\".\n\tThe case went on as it was going on.  I requested Sally Corlett as to, can she not represent us at the Commission and she complied.  She gave us forms to fill in that we are going to be represented by her at the Commission.  \n\tWe duly did so and we told here: \"If we are represented at the Commission, please tell the Commission we have stopped being represented by Mr Ntonga and Mbandazayo.  He must send those forms that was sent to the Commission through our names, those that he said he was going to fill in in his office and then bring them to us so that we could see them\".  It did not come back.\n\tIndeed the Commission sent back those forms that were sent by them.  That form came back blank with our signature only.  What he did, what Mr Mbandazayo did was to go to the police and ask for a confession statement or confessions statements we made during our arrest and tied them to this with a stapler and sent them the Commission.  \n\tI showed him this at the Court in Bisho and said to him: \"Is this the reason why you said we must not go to the Court\"? and he did not answer.  Till today he does not greet me.  What he did now just recently, he met Dumisani's mother and said: \"Ja, your sons have sold out, they took Tjobane to the TRC and to the Court.  They are not going to be saved by the Commission\".  \n\tTo say a person is: \"sold out\" is to just insult a person.  I do not know how they can say such a thing as I'm still in prison.  Today I've come to ask for amnesty as I have come to ask for forgiveness.  This matter that he was going to say this is what happened to the Commission passed.  \n\tThe case went on, the police went to take Tona who was our driver during the Bahai matter and made this, and turned him into a State witness.  Tona's statement is the same as ours.  The Court could not hold us accountable.  \n\tThe Court decided that Jimmy Jones must be brought in as a State witness to testify against us.  He did not do so.  After three days saying that he's consulting with Mr Mbandazayo he could not.  He said he was going to come to the Commission.  \n\tWe called ...[indistinct] Mpashlele as the witness in our favour.  He told the Court the report back about all these missions including that of the Bahai Faith Tjabane got and he thanked him.  That is what he said at Court.\n\tDuring the case, Tjabane arrived in prison on a Saturday.  They arrived at the same time with my mother who came to visit me.  Africa Jimmy Jones had called myself and Dumisani, Jlomo and Siko to tell us that we must change what we told the Court because what we did was to sell out and to change that which we were going to say to the Commission because he's not going to go there, he's going to go and deny everything.\n\tWe told him: \"Africa, you see you don't command us here, it is not at the base here.  For that matter we are not guerillas we are just civilians and you cannot tell us what we must do and that which we must not do, this is not the army\".\n\tHe sweared to us and said we are people supposed to be killed and my mother was also telling him a lot of things, he left.  We told the Court about all of this because he's now threatening us.  The Court ordered him never to go back to prison.  \n\tIt was not long thereafter another African came.  The last time I saw him was in 1995, Numanilili who aksed what madness we are doing, that we mention Tjobane at the TRC and at the Court.  As we were trying to answer he swore at me and hit me.  It was in prison.  I hit him very hard, I don't want to lie, I hit him very hard, I hit him. \tHe left saying that he was going to charge me and I lay a charge against him too.",

For instance our people in South Africa never, for example, have Umkhonto weSizwe and APLA, the military wings and AZANLA, the military wing of AZAPO, it did not simply occur that way.\n\tAt first there was Imbumba manjana, unity, and there we got the ANC and then the PAC and then we got Poko, that's when our people saw that we are trying to negotiate with these people, talking about our own thing, when they respond they kill us.  That's when our people decided to make plans to fight back, they created armies.  The first one was Poka, another one was they fought back.  \n\tI'm trying to say violence is not the correct manner and our people were forced to adopt violence as a method to free themselves, it was not their initial intention or to the armed struggle.",
