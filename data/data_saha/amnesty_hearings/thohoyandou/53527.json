It was then that we went further because in other countries youth congresses were being formed and then we also decided to form such youth congress of Mahvunga village.  What was more important was for us to be involved in politics because we were starting to realise that there are many things which we were expecting in relation to politics.  When we formed this youth congress it was then that we started to establish something which we wanted to correct because there were people who were having grievances, not knowing how to overcome them. We were having grievances in connection with ritual murder and witchcraft, some of the obstacles which were disturbing and then that led us into asking our headman by then that we be allowed in that Mahvunga country, that all the people who were involved in witchcraft should be evicted if possible.
