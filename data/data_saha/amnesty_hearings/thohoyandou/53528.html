<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  I am now calling no.2724/96, that of John Masithulela.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a>	May I also indicate inasfar as this applicant is concerned just finalising the affidavits in respect of all of them so we will be able to submit some of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What do you mean you are going to submit some of them if they are all being finalised?  Wouldn't you submit all of them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Yes.  They will all be ready.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who is this applicant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Masithulela, John.  Page 52.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">JOHN MASITHULELA:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR NDOU:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Masithulela I see that in your application that you brought before the Committee is that you indicate that you are here to seek amnesty in respect of offences for which you were convicted during November 1992, it being public violence, murder and arson.  Were you convicted of all these three offences?</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> And for that you were in prison for a period of 12 years, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Now we have evidence here, and I want you to explain to the Committee ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Wait before you carry on, public violence in respect of what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> It's in connection with being involved in a group which were making violence at Hamavonga.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ja on whose house or on who or what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> It is in the house of Mr Edward Mahvunga and Petrus Mahvunga.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And murder?  Mr Ndou do you know in respect of what crimes he's making application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Yes I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Please tell us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Now you also indicate that you ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No you tell us what you got instructions ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> It is in the murder of her daughter, ...(indistinct) government ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And arson?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> It's also in respect of the burning ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And the public violence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> I think the public violence was generalised in a sense it pertained to the violence that took as an alternative charge to the charge of arson that took place at Petrus' house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Petrus.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> With respect Mr Chairman I don't think that is so.  I think the accused was convicted of arson as an alternative count to count 3 which actually happened on the 28th of February at the house of the deceased.  That is how I understand it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now you people are confusing me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Are you talking about the arson or the public violence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> He was accused no.4.  He was sentenced for public violence - four years imprisonment.  That's on page 213.  Counts three and seven taken together to 12 years imprisonment.  Three was the arson and seven was the murder of Edward.  And three was the burning of the house.  So it was public violence, according to the judgment on page 213.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He was found guilty of public violence in the alternative on count 2, which was the arson charge in respect of the deceased's house on the 28th of February.  He was also convicted of murder of the deceased and arson in respect of the deceased's house that occurred on the 6th.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Now Mr Masithulela I want you to explain to the Committee as to how it came about that this whole incident took place, slowly and very clearly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> This violence started in 1990.  It was during the time when the Venda government was not ruling properly.  Myself as a youth I found it fit that I participated in overthrowing the power of the past government so that it can be totally abolished.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay we accept that now.  You know you are here before us seeking amnesty in respect of the death and arson on the deceased.  The death of the deceased and arson on his house and also public violence in respect of a gathering outside his brother's house.  Correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Yes it's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now what did you do in respect of Petrus' house there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> In connection with Petrus' house I burnt - let me say I started by attempting to burn the house of Mr Petrus Mahvunga and then I went and burnt the house of Petrus Mahvunga and it burnt, that one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you together with people or?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Yes I was together with other youth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So did the house burn?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Initially the fire burnt and it went down and it wasn't burnt - the first time.  And for the second time we burnt it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> On the same day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Now it was not on the same day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Alright.  And you were generally in a group whose actions were regarded as violent at that time, when you tried to burn?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> The government of that day took us as if we were doing violence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I am not talking about the government, I am asking what you did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Could you please repeat your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You tried to burn Petrus' house on a particular day.  You failed.  When you did so you were in a group of people whose actions were violent, or intended to be violent.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Yes I can agree.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay.  Now then you left his place, Petrus?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Yes we left that place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And that occurred before the deceased died?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Could you repeat your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You know the deceased, Edward, the attack on Petrus' house occurred before Edward died.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Before the killing of Edward we first burnt the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Of Petrus?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Yes of Petrus.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But when you tried to burn Petrus' house it happened before the day Edward died, am I correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Yes he was not yet killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Alright.  Now let's get on to the attack on Edward's house.  What did you do there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> In Petrus Mahvunga's house I found myself in a group of youths who went there to burn ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Not Petrus, Edward.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Edward, okay, I didn't get you clear then.  In the house of Edward Mahvunga I was in a group of youths who went to Edward Mahvunga to evict him to leave Mahvunga Village.  As it has been already explained that he was given a "trek pass" and he was refusing to leave the village.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you believe that there was a "trek pass" for him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Yes I agree but being told it was there, by the people who told me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who told you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> I was told by the youth, I was with them in the meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> I can't remember the name because in the meeting people were just speaking collectively or at the same time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Whose meeting or what kind of meeting was it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> It was the youth meeting in connection with arranging the formation of the youth congress.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay.  Then what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> The youth on arriving at Edward Mahvunga's house they tried to talk to him so that he can leave Mahvunga Village.  The negotiations with Edward Mahvunga and the youth was such that they were not agreeing with each other because he was refusing to leave the country because he's having the house and the kids.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a>	It happened that while they were exchanging different words where he was refusing to go they started a fight of throwing stones.  People were throwing stones to the deceased, at the deceased and in the deceased's house to get that to the kids who were in the yard.  The deceased was also throwing stones and the kids were doing likewise towards us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Mr van Rensburg as far as what happened at the house, the stone throwing, the setting alight, the killing, the leaving of the women, are we having any disputes about that or can we accept what in broad happened there - there was a stone throwing and the deceased was killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Yes I think that can be accepted.  I think there's only about three differences and that's minor differences.  One is already on record I think, is if the family, the rest of the family were allowed to leave or escape.  And the other one was this fight, was it actually started by the deceased or started by the mob.  And I almost can't think of a third one.  So regarding the broad events, ja, there is no ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Well I think it's common they've been killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> What's not common cause is the reason for the killing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Isn't that the real dispute in the whole thing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> That is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> And you've heard the evidence of the other people about the killing.  In broad would he agree with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Yes I agree.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Is there anything you want to add to what they've already told us about the facts of the killing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> I don't have something which I want to add but I can just say or explain what I did on the very same day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You don't want to add anything to what they say, not yet?  Can you think of anything you want to add?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Ja, there is something new which I can add, but it is something which I heard about it.  What I want to add is when the previous speaker, Nemakhavani, saying that he doesn't know the executive members of Myco, that is Mahvunga Youth Congress, I was told about them and they were known in the whole nation who they were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He didn't, but that's what you want to add, that you knew the identities of those people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Yes I know them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Right.  Now tell us what you did there at Edward's house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> The executive members - myself on the killing of the deceased I got into the house on the ...(indistinct) side using - getting into the yard of the deceased.  I reached the garage of the car.  I saw a car which was burning on the other side of it.  I took a tyre which was close by.  I made it catch fire and then go and burn the car which was already burning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Yes, that's all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You saw the stone throwing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Yes I saw them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you with it, do you associate with it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Yes I associate myself with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You knew that the deceased was going to die?</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Could you please repeat your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You were aware that the deceased was going to die?</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> No I wasn't aware.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you see them burning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Of the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Of the deceased.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> No I didn't see him burning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But you knew that there was going to be an attack on him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> No I was not aware that he is going to be attacked.  I only know that they were going to talk with the deceased so that the deceased could leave the Mahvunga Village.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You saw the stone throwing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Yes I saw them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So who were the stones being directed at?</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> The stones were, most of them were directed to the deceased.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> By a lot of people, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Yes, by many people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you throw stones?</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Yes I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you also directed it at the deceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Yes I directed them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> At that time you must have realised that he would die as a result of being thrown by the - that he would die as a result of the stone throwing, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Ja it's quite clear that if one is being stoned at by stones could possibly die.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You associated yourself because you also threw stones at him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And then the house was also burning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Yes that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you know how it got burnt, how it started burning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> I cannot explain that clearly because where I was, the direction I was in there was fire which was burning in the car, but later I saw heavy smoke of fire on the other side of the house.  I don't know how the fire started.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you saw that smoke coming from the house did you associate yourself with that burning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> No I don't associate myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But did you agree with the others who had started that fire in that house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Yes I agreed that others have started that fire, because if I was with them then I associated myself with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That's what I am getting at.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Could you please repeat your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> You in fact helped burning the car and you would have helped burning the house if you had the opportunity.  You helped burning the car, you assisted in burning the car, and you would have helped them burning the house if you had the opportunity, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Yes I burnt the car and assisted in the burning of the house simply because I was a member of people who were burning.  Then I was supporting what they were doing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why was Petrus and Edward targeted in this way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> As far as I am concerned ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Let's deal with Petrus first - okay, nevermind deal with it as you want.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> As I was growing there at Mahvunga Village I heard rumours that Petrus Mahvunga is also a witch.  On the part of the deceased as I was growing I heard people saying that the deceased is also participating in witchcraft.</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you believe that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> That they are witches?</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ja, those rumours, you believed that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Yes I believed that those people are witches.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Good.  Now you told us in the beginning of your testimony that you wanted a political change in Venda.  Venda must go back to Pretoria.  Did I understand you correctly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Yes it's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now how did what you did to Petrus and to Edward, how was that connected with your political wish that Venda should be reincorporated with South Africa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> The link is in this way.  The leaders of those days of the previous government of the independence of Venda they were people who were leading this country in unacceptable way because there was violences here, there were no more schools; workers were no longer going to work.  As I looked I found that that person, because he's participating in witchcraft I say that because the leaders of the past were linked with the medical doctors and witches to find medicine so that they could have power or protect their powers by then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You say medical doctors, what medical doctors?</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Traditional doctors or healers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now we've had evidence which linked traditional healers with traditional murders etc, is that what you are referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Could you please repeat your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You referred to certain people as traditional healers.  Earlier in this hearing we've heard that traditional healers were directly responsible for ritual murders.</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Yes that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are the traditional healers the same people that you are referring to that was described as having been the cause of ritual murders?  That's what I am trying to - are you talking about the same people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Yes but I think they are the people who are causing the root of this matter, because in various countries when they find the people who are committing ritual murders they first go to the traditional doctors to find out who was the witch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you say that your belief was that the people leading this country in such a bad way were linked to the witches and traditional healers in order to sustain their power in the country?  Did I understand you correctly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Yes I said it like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Good.  Carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Thank you, I am indebted to you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a>	Mr Masithulela you see the victims are before the Committee here, how do you feel now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Yes for now at this point of democracy I find it very hurting to see the youth who are sitting in front of me without parents, because it was caused by the previous government.  If it was not because of the previous government I think by now their parents will be still alive.  As such I feel that I must humble myself before the children of the deceased and tell them that what happened then it happened.  So for now I have to cry or sympathise with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You say it wasn't personal, it was just a political circumstance that had to occur?</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Yes it's true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you happy to go to them privately perhaps and make your peace with them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Yes I will be very happy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ... attitude would be but I would ask the respective representatives to investigate that possibility.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Thank you Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR NDOU</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> What was Edward Mahvunga's position in the community?</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> I know that he was the younger brother to the headmen, Adam Roksane Mahvunga.</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> ...said to have used witchcraft to protect his power, what power - Edward Mahvunga, in the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> It's ....</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Answer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> I am asking that you repeat your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How was Edward's alleged ability as a witch, how did that help those who were in authority?</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> The power of Mr Edward or witch powers?  Whose power?</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You said that you believed that Edward was a witch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Yes it's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Whose powers were used and helped to sustain the power of the authorities, for example his brother.  That's how I understood your evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Yes it's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Our colleague here has asked you, how did Edward use his power to assist maybe his brother, let's say for example?</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> I don't have the powers which I can tell this house that was having this powers of assisting his brother.</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can you explain it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Maybe I cannot understand the powers which people are wanting to know about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Because it is witchcraft?</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> No I am asking that you ask your question clearly, I don't hear you well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ... that witches have - I am not asking you to give me a scientific explanation of those kind of powers.  Are you able to describe to us how Edward, if he was in fact a witch or wizard, and had these powers, strange powers, how would he use it to assist someone in authority?  Do you know, if you do know can you tell us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> In connection with Mr Edward I don't know, but in general because of the violence which was happening in Venda witches were assisting in helping the government of the past.  With Mr Edward I cannot explain that because I don't know that he was having witch powers which can assist maybe the headman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ... in general.  How would these witches assist the government of the day then to retain what they had, to entrench apartheid maybe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Witches assisted the previous government in this way.  They went to extent where they were used.  Let me put it this way, the government was comprised by chiefs or headmen or the government of the past was composed of headmen, chiefs, indunas and the like.</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You say chiefs, headmen, indunas and?</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Those are the people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now you say the government was comprised of these kind of people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Ja, and others, ordinary people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So how would a witch assist these people with their strange powers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> The chiefs used to consult people at the grassroots level and consult the traditional doctors so that they could assist them by mutis or medicine through which they can prevent or protect the power of their government and these witches were used to destroy the youth who were having politics which were with them by then.  Some of the youths were made to be zombis.  Some were being killed.  Some were being made to become mad.  Something like that, and so on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> I just want to get some clarity on the position of Edward Mahvunga.  Is it your case that Edward was evicted because he himself was a witch, was practising witchcraft?  Or is it your case that Edward was evicted because he was making use of muti to sustain his position in the society?</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> What I can say, what I know is that the deceased was killed because he was being suspected in witchcraft, and because I know that witches co-operated with the rulers of the time I realised that it is fit for them to be killed, because they are assisting the people who are ruling at the time so that they can continue with the ruling while oppressing us, the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> ....in your area at the time was Adam Mahvunga.</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He was the father.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Yes it's true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> So was there suspicion that Edward was perhaps assisting Adam to sustain or to protect his power in the area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> I cannot say it's like that because Adam Mahvunga I think by the way he reacted when he wrote a "trek pass" he wrote it due to pressure.  I think he was not co-operating with the headman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Another point which I want to clarify, if you then wanted to have freedom or to have some political change why didn't you get rid of the traditional leaders themselves?</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Well I personally in my view will say not only were witches killed but traditional leaders were killed too.</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Your explanations in respect of Edward and why he was attacked, would that apply to Petrus also?</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Could you just repeat again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ....know why Edward was attacked, on what political basis?  Would the same apply to Petrus?</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Well it's the same because he too was suspected of the same act because it appeared that they were co-operating with the government.</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> One thing I want to clear up.  The chief Adam was on the Reef, he was in Johannesburg or somewhere, working there, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Yes, true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Is that right, it's true, he was working in Johannesburg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Yes it is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> As I understand it that while he was away Edward sort-of assumed power and pretended to be a chief, is that right or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Yes - well in my view it was perceived that way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In your view it was perceived that way you say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> So was he loyal to the chief or did he undermine the chief?</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Well I would say the late who was doing whatever people were doing but he will also disagree with other issues.  For example as the previous witness has said, according to the traditional set-up, if the chief had said each house had to contribute one rand for a particular event he will have contributed or he won't contribute.</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> So if he was a witch this witch didn't support the traditional leader.  He didn't listen to him, he didn't support him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Well I won't say he wouldn't support.  I don't know whether there was any other underground movement or activities.  It could have been true that he was co-operating with the government from above downwards as the whole country in Venda was a little ungovernable or mixed up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  I will proceed with the cross-examination.</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a>	Mr Masithulela you testified that as far as your knowledge goes there was a "trek pass" ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Sorry are you speaking above the mike, I can't hear clearly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Pardon, I will repeat the question.  You testified that as far as your knowledge goes there was a "trek pass" issued for the deceased.  What I want to know is was that also the situation for Petrus, his brother?</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Mr Petrus Mahvunga wasn't issued with a "trek pass".</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Just repeat that, was not?  I didn't hear, just repeat your answer please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> As far as he knows ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> As far as he is concerned he was not issued with a "trek pass".</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Now if Petrus was not issued with a "trek pass" why did you participate in trying to burn down his house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Well I was involved in the arson case based on the fact that he was suspected of the act.</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> The act?</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Yes the act of witchcraft.</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> I was under the impression from the evidence led by the previous witnesses that they tried everything in their power, they went through all the channels, got the police, got the "trek passer" to persuade the deceased ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> Excuse me I do have a technical problem.</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a>PROBLEMS WITH MICROPHONE</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Yes it's true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Interpreter are you okay now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> It's not me with the technical problem, I seem to be okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay whatever is the technical problem sorted out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> It seems so yes, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  From the previous witnesses I got the impression that they went a long way, and they were very patient to execute all possible measures to persuade the deceased to leave the area.  They got a "trek pass" for him; they went to the police, they went to the chief...(tape ends)</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> It was not the same as with Mr Petrus.</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Then you've got to explain to me what was the difference between these two cases?  Why would the one be expected as a witch and all the procedures according to your other colleagues were followed, but in his instance it was not followed, what was the difference?</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> The difference was on the fact that Petrus Mahvunga had his house burnt down and he was under pressure and he left Mahvunga Village.  The deceased could not leave automatically or voluntarily.</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Yes I'm talking up to the situation where before his house was burnt, because we accept that when his house was burnt he fled.  But before that, why was there a difference.  Why was his position handled differently?  I'm referring to Petrus.</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> The difference was that Petrus Mahvunga was not really in dispute with the political activities in Mahvunga Village.</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a>	With regard to the deceased he was really disputing that he didn't like that to happen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Now if Petrus was not disputing that why did you want to evict him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Well when I say he disputed I'm saying he never obstructed us in any way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Yes we've heard you saying that.  The question is why did you still evict him or want to evict him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Well Petrus, well it was necessary for him to be evicted because he was suspected of witchcraft.</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was that the only reason?</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Yes, with regard to Petrus Mahvunga.</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Did you at the time have evidence that Petrus, specifically, used his powers as a witch to support the system?</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Well I personally don't have evidence, but what I know is that with regard to the then situation when the Venda government was still in control of the - everybody was saying the traditional healers and witches were in co-operation so that the government should not really be targeted or ended.</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Yes but we are talking about Petrus now.  You confirmed that you had no such specific information regarding Petrus.</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What, what specific information?</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> That he specifically used his powers to uphold the system.</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think he's already testified that in both cases he did not have any specific knowledge but believed that witches were doing that, and that's as far as he could link both deceased and Petrus to the government, sustaining the government's status quo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Yes perhaps I may have missed that point regarding Petrus.  Thank you Mr Chairman.  I will continue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a>	You say that you have information for us about this Mavangwe Youth Congress.  Can you for instance tell us who the chairman was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Yes I can.</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Please do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> The chairperson was Mr Muladi Ntsundeni.  The other person I heard of as being treasurer was Nthangeni Calvin Phungo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> I see.  And this chairman, let's talk about the chairman first, Muladi Ntsundeni.  Was he present on the 6th of April when the deceased was murdered?</p>

<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That can be a dangerous question, because he may implicate that person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Yes I do understand that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I just want to know what the purpose of your question is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Well the purpose of my question Mr Chairman also relates of course to the question of full disclosure.  I believe that it is obviously one of the functions of this hearing that persons who did not make application for amnesty should be identified through this process.</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, no, that's not one of our jobs.  If it so happens so be it, but we are not here to make that enquiry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Well in that instance I will not press the situation further.  If the Chairman will just allow me to get an answer to this question, if he was present.  I think it is necessary to know.  I think the witness already testified that he was present.  Can I just confirm that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a>	Can you just say if he was present or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Yes I was present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Not you, the leader that you have referred to, the Chairman, was he present on the 6th of April?</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> I can't tell whether he was there or not because there were a lot of people.  One could not really identify particular people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Thank you.  I have no further questions for this witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS PATEL:</span> Thank you Chairperson.  Perhaps just to clear my confusion as to the evidence you've led about Petrus, my understanding is that this applicant was convicted of the public violence case in respect of Edward Mahvunga, not in respect of Petrus Mahvunga and that in fact is an incident that took place on the 28th of February as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a>	Perhaps before I pose any questions to the applicant Mr Ndou can clear up ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> Sorry I again have that particular problem.  Will the technicians come to my assistance please.  Carry on Ma'am.</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> If you refer to page 190 of the judgement ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You are quite right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> He says Count 2, the alternative to count 2.</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes I think we've all overlooked it and I want Mr Ndou to pay particular attention.  He was convicted and I thought everybody who appears for all the applicants would have known this.  He was convicted of count 2 in the alternative, being public violence.  Count 2 was a count in respect of an unlawful attack on the property of the deceased on the 28th of February.</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a>	He's also convicted on count 3 which was an attack on the same house on the 6th of April.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a>	And he was also convicted on count 7 during this attack at that house on the 6th of April the deceased was killed.  So Petrus doesn't feature in this application.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a>	Come on Mr Ndou, you should be aware of this.  Proceed Ms Patel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Okay, thank you.  Given that oversight then Sir, could you just briefly explain to us what your role was at Mr Mahvunga's house on the 28th of February, sorry, Edward yes, the deceased, on the 28th of February.  Not on the 6th, not on the day when he was killed, what was your role in that public violence incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Well on the 28th of February at Edward Mahvunga's place I was in the midst of the youth who went to put the house on fire so that he could be evicted from Mahvunga Village.  I was one of those people who burned one of the rooms in Edward Mahvunga's house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> On the first attempt?</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Yes, if I am not mistaken it was on the day when Petrus Mahvunga's house was burned down.  I might be mixing the date.</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Maybe I can help you.  The public violence matter for which you were convicted occurred on the same day that Petrus Mahvunga's house was burnt down.  Does that help you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Could you repeat the statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> I am saying the public violence charge for which you were convicted, the burning of the house of Mr, or burning of the property of Edward Mahvunga occurred on the same day that the house of Petrus Mahvunga was burnt down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Well that is why I in my answer said I could not remember exactly whether it happened on the same day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Anyway look what did you do there at the deceased's house on the first attack?  That's what we want to know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> On the first day of the attack we were so many.  We found Boshoff Mahvunga, Mtengeni Mahvunga, they were the ones who were in the yard.  When we saw the group of the youth coming towards the house they ran away, jumped the fence.  When they left the youth who were there started destroying or breaking the windows.  I was also involved in doing that.  I was also involved in the arson case ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How did they start ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Well they were just throwing stones.</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay.  And that was an attack on the deceased's house on the 28th.  Was it burnt that day or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Yes it was burned on the same day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But not at that attack - or when?  When they started throwing the stones was it that same incident where the house was burnt?</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Just when the stones were being thrown the other ones were burning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The other incident is when the house was burnt on the 6th of April.</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Could you repeat that please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> There were two incidents of attack on the deceased's house, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Are you referring to Edward Mahvunga's house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, he's the deceased.</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Yes it is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ja.  The one occurred for the purposes of this application on the 28th of February.</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And the other one occurred on the 6th of April when Edward was killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> What I did was to throw stones ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No wait we are coming - I am just trying to identify the incidents.  Do you agree?</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Yes I agree with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay.  Now on the 6th of April you were convicted and you make application for amnesty in respect of arson in that that house of Edward was burnt on the 6th of April.</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> It is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Let's go to the 28th of February.</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> That is what I ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When the stones were thrown.  You threw and other colleagues of yours threw stones, broke windows etc.</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Yes ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Whilst the house burnt on that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Yes, it was burned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now it was burnt a second time on the 6th of April.</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Carry on Ms Patel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> The first burning of the house in February, did Edward already receive a "trek pass" at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Well I don't know.  Well I said regarding the "trek pass" I only learnt from my colleagues or other people.  When that was happening I had already been arrested on charges of arson on Petrus Mahvunga and Edward Mahvunga.  I was already in jail when all those kind of things were happening regarding the "trek pass".</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> So you didn't know anything about the "trek pass" until after the arrest?</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Well I didn't know anything.  That is why I was saying I had an imaginary view of what happened regarding the "trek pass" and I also learnt it from other people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> When did you learn it from the other people?  When did you for the first time hear of a "trek pass"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Well I for the first time when I heard about the "trek pass" was after the death of the deceased.</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> So they were not telling him there - "listen here's a "trek pass" you should move out, you should go away and then we leave you", they didn't try to persuade him to go and tell him "listen we've got a "trek pass" for you"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Could you repeat the statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> That on the 6th of April, the day when he was killed, didn't the people tell him "listen you should move out, we've got a "trek pass" for you.  The Chief issued a "trek pass" - go, and then we won't attack you"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Well he was told.</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Now didn't you hear it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> I didn't hear that.  I only learned that some people who were on the other side said or declared that -there were a lot of things which were said.  No one will really identify that so-and-so said the following things.  There were so many people and people were shouting and ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> You are trying to evade my question.  Did you hear about a "trek pass" before the man was killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> I said I heard about the "trek pass" after this man had already died.</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> So on the day of the killing you didn't hear people say, "move out of the vicinity, you've got a trek pass, get away from our village"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Well I didn't hear that at the place where I was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Did you hear about the list that there was ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Didn't you tell me earlier, or tell us earlier that you heard about this "trek pass" in the meeting, the youth meeting when you people were discussing this whole issue, before the man died?</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> I said I heard about the "trek pass" and they said there was a meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But didn't you tell me earlier that you were called to a meeting where this man was discussed and then you went to his house?  That's what you said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> That was on the day when the late died.</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ja.  Before he died.</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Yes I heard that before he died.</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now you are telling my colleague that you only heard about it for the first time after he died.  You were in jail or wherever.</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Yes, well logically what I want to say is that I was in jail, yes it's true, but I enquired and I was told about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ja but the whole issue was when was the first time you heard about the "trek pass".  Now you've given us two versions of it.  One before he died and one after he died.  Now what gives - what's the truth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Well personally on the day when I heard about the "trek pass" and that he was given was when I was out of jail on the 5th of April.  I was released on the day in which Mr Ramushwana took over the government.</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And on the 6th of April the deceased died.</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Yes he died.</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Did Mr Ramushwana take over the government before the deceased was killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Yes he took over the government and the deceased died the next day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> And did Mr Ramushwana, when he took over the government, announce that he would incorporate Venda with Pretoria again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> He did not say that - I remember in his speech he alluded to the fact that he made the country governable and minimise the violence and he will end the violence.  That is what I heard on his speech.</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes Ms Patel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Thank you Honourable Chairperson.  We've had testimony that there was a list of witches that were to be dealt with by the community, were you aware of this list?</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Yes I am quite aware of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Do you know when the list was compiled?  Was it before the first attack on Mr Mahvunga's house, Edward Mahvunga's house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> The list was - I don't know about the list, I know that so-and-so was suspected of witchcraft, not a list.</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> But you have just stated Sir, that you knew about the list.</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> I am referring to the logical order of the people who were suspected of witchcraft.</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> When did you hear about this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> When I first heard about that, before the house of Petrus Mahvunga was burnt, I can't remember the date.</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Okay, and can you recall whether by that time, Edward Mahvunga had made his political feelings, or his feelings about your political activity, known or did that happen after the list came out, after you know it was said that these people must be dealt with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Could you repeat it please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Okay, you say that you heard that there were certain people who were named at witches and wizards and who were to be dealt with, right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Yes, it is true.  When you say to be dealt with, what are you referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> They will be banished or asked to leave or whatever.  There was a list of alleged wizards and witches, not so?  Do you know about that list?</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> I know about the names of the people who were said to be on the list.</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, so you know about the list?</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> If I know about the names, it seems to be logical to say yes, I know about the list, but I didn't personally handle or hold the list in my hand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay, that is all that was asked of you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Okay, thank you sir.   This list that was compiled, the names of the people that were on that list, can you tell us whether you know whether any of those people that were on the list, had interfered in the political activity of the Youth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Well, regarding the witches, especially the ones who were on the list, the ones who were involved in the politics, was Mr Edward Mahvunga.</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Is he the only one on the list of alleged suspected or alleged, yes, witches and wizards who was in some way linked to political activities?</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Well, I know of him only.  I can't tell exactly, I heard about the other people who were being alleged, but I don't know whether there were any difficulties in that regard, but if they had obstructed our way, we could have also realised that they were in support of what I thought that Mr Edward was alleged to be witch and his co-operation with the government of the day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Okay.  Can you tell us whether you know from your experience, whether Edward had in fact antagonised the youth politically prior to the list having been formulated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Could you repeat?</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Okay, can you tell us sir, whether you know that Edward Mahvunga had interfered with the Youth's political activity prior to the list having been formulated or was there the list first and then there was the interference from him with your political activity?</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> In my answer I said that I heard about a list of these people who were suspected of being witches after the death of the deceased, whereas I have heard about the other names some of the names, before I was released.  I gathered some names like Mtsinya, Wilisoga, Gangari.</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We haven't got time to listen to irrelevant, stuff that you haven't been asked.  All you have been asked is did the deceased interfere with the Youth before or after you came to know about that list?</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> No, because during that time, we didn't really have this political activities, because it was just an emotional activity from other countries, and it was really flickering down to our community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So what you are saying is that he only started interfering with the youth after this list was drafted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> It could be that he started involving himself after the list.</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> So then, if that is the position that he only involved himself with the youth on that level, after the list, is it fair then to say that he would have been dealt with in terms of either banishment or being killed, regardless of his involvement with the Youth, that because there was the list that was out, he would have been dealt with any way by the Youth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> Well, in my view, I think he would have been dealt with because it was in accordance with those who were also suspected of being witches, so that they shall be banished.  Because he was one of those people who were suspected as witches, he could have been taken away as well.  He was so aggressive, because he wanted to defend himself, he was not the same as other people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> And then just finally sir, did you have an axe with you at the house of Edward on the day that he was killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> Sorry are you saying axe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> An axe, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> I didn't have an axe.  However, as I was being cross-questioned in the Supreme Court, I heard that, I learnt from Rosinnah Mahvunga saying that I had an axe.  On my recollection, I sold the axe when the deceased died, but I didn't have it in my hand.  It was alluded to that I used the axe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I am not concerned about what was alluded to, you say you didn't have an axe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> I didn't have an axe, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Okay, and you didn't have a petrol bomb with you either?</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASITHULELA:</span> I didn't have a petrol bomb.</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> All right, thank you Honourable Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS PATEL</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> No re-examination, thank you.</p>
