<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Now I wish to start calling the evidence of the applicants themselves and I intend starting with Ramasitsi, that's 2723/36, I suppose it should read 96.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Ramasitsi, what language would you prefer to use?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> English.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you sure?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If during your testimony you wish to change, then please indicate to your attorney please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a>Before I ask you the next question, is there any particular reason you have that thing on your head?</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> I beg your pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is there any particular reason that you need to have that on your head?</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Because of my ear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Your ear?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is wrong with your ear?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> My ear, the right ear Sir has been torn off.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Oh, okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">ROGER KACHERO RAMASITSI:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR NDOU:</span> Mr Ramasitsi, you are applicant number 2723 of 96, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> And your full names are Roger Kachero Ramasitsi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Now could you tell the Committee as to when were you born?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> I was born 5 May 1970.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> I see, so that makes you 29 now, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Of course.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> And you've come before this Amnesty Committee to apply for amnesty for certain acts or commission that you committed during 1990, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Absolutely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Ndou, before you proceed, I just want to indicate to you that at the end of the hearing the Committee would expect you to indicate which crimes each applicant would be applying for amnesty for.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> That is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Because we are not going to give amnesty for something that is not asked for.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> That is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a>	Now, is it correct that indeed in 1992, November, you were sentenced for certain offences which took place on the 28th and 6th April 1990, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Now for which offences were you convicted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> I was convicted of arson and murder also.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> And this murder that you are alleged to have committed, who was the deceased person in the matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> The deceased is Mr Edward Mahvunga.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> And where did deceased Edward Mahvunga reside?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> He resided at Mahvunga location.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> And you, where do you reside?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> I reside at Mahvunga location too.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Now when I looked at your date of birth, I see that in 1990 you were 20 years of age, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Of course.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Now, you are appearing here before the Committee with several others, 8 other people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Now I want you to slowly go through and explain to the Committee as to what transpired before you did whatever you did and why you did it, so that the Committee can understand before they can take a decision as to whether to grant you amnesty or not.  Do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Thank you.  Can I go?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Yes, please do so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> I think I should start at the time when the man was released himself, I mean the Honourable Mr Mandela.  The time he was released, I still remember every feeling of the youth here in Venda, particularly in our region, there was a general feeling that we have to be free and that freedom was to come through our contribution.  So as Mr Professor here said, in the urban areas the youth were involved in many things to render the country ungovernable as such.  So in the rural areas there came to be a time when things weren't going right, as I can say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Could you just pause in between sentences so that we could take notes, please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Right, just take it slow.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Okay.  At the time of the release of Mr Nelson Mandela the youth were very much emotionally charged because at the time, that was the time of political awareness amongst us, the youth.  During that time there was a confusion, if not a confusion at all as I can say, the youth were very much distanced from playing political role here in our region because everything which was done, it was done for us by the elders.  We felt that as the youth we have to contribute to our freedom as such.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a>	During that time, it was the time when political parties were starting to stage rallies around our region, particularly in our area where I was staying in Nzhelele.  So during that time, we used to go to all the rallies, addressed by those big political powers, I mean those big political names in South Africa.  During that time, it was the time that everyone said that there was a quest for freedom, so there came to be a time when we had to strategise so as to be in form with those comrades in the urban area.  As I still remember, our comrades in the urban areas were involved in rent boycotts, consumer boycotts, strikes and all the likes, whereas here in the rural areas there were no such things, so there came to be a time when we thought that for us to contribute in our struggle, we have to remove such obstacles that were making it difficult for us to be free as such, as everybody was thinking that now Mandela is out, we are going to be free.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a>	Here in the rural areas, it was not that easy.  There were many confrontations with the police and the defence force as such because during that time almost every main road here in Venda, it was manned by the comrades because every now and then there was a movement of youth going up and down attending rallies in the stadium and in the committee halls as such.  So, we used to hold meetings in our village.  Mostly when we came from major rallies, when we came back, we used to address those youth who used to stay behind for protection.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Okay.  If I may ask you, were you organised as a group, or were you just a group of separate individuals who'd come to meet, what prevailed at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> So at that time, as I have said, it was emotionally, it was a feeling amongst the youth that for us to be counted as the freedom fighters, because at that time it was during the time of the unbanning of political parties, during that time I cannot say we were members as here in the rural area there was not that political awareness that everyone can say I have to be a member, I have to be a card carrying member, so I can say we were supporters of those political parties, at such time, but we were not card carrying members as we were just starting to mobilise so that we can have our own youth congress as such at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> 1990.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now tell me, I'm going to ask you a very important question.  These activities and the development of your youth congresses and all that went after, why was that done?  Was it done perhaps to show the rest of the country that things can also happen here and that the youth in the area must not be thought of negatively, or what was the actual reason?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> The actual reason was that as we came to realise that this independence which had been granted by the South African Government, it was null and void because the truth is that actually it was no independence at all, it was just, what can I say, it was just a mickey mouse independence, so the youth came to be aware of that.  So the general feeling amongst the youth was that we have to fight to see this banana republic returned back to where it belongs, the South African Government at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was that a genuine feeling amongst the youth or was it just to show the other youth that you are their equals politically?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> It was the general feelings amongst us the youth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Thank you.  Okay, that time after those major rallies, it came to be known amongst us that now that the youth had come to see the light, they have to fight to see this Venda going back to where it belongs.  So when it comes to the strategies that we used to employ, in trying to render this state ungovernable, we decided that as we have got so many obstacles that are making it impossible for us to be free as we have to see that people have to be redeemed from those chains that South Africa have made us suffer for a long time as such, we have to devise some strategies and such strategies were very, they were no, I mean, specific directives as to what has to be done.  As we were the youth ourselves, we felt the pressure mounting within us that the closest target which we can deal with, let's say it can be witches as such, so we started to hold meetings.  We used to hold meetings sometimes three times a week, maybe Sunday, Tuesday,. Thursday or Fridays.  So it used to be three times a week.  So the first meeting I remember we held.  May I carry on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Okay, let me try to assist you so that we can move faster.  You resided at Mahvunga location?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Do you have a traditional leader at Mahvunga?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> And who is the traditional leader at Mahvunga?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> His name, I forget his name, he's got his Venda name, his name is Adam Mahvunga.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Now this Adam Mahvunga, does he lead your village from within?  Does he reside at Mahvunga as well or does he reside elsewhere?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Where does he reside?  Does he reside at Mahvunga?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> In fact he resides at Mahvunga but he is a commuter.  By commuter I say he is the one who works in the Reef, he used to come back some times.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Yes okay.  Now you say during that period your group of young people would gather and hold meetings, whereat you discussed certain issues affecting you as people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Right.  And I also understood you to be telling the Committee that during that period you had come to see the light, you had come to see that what you were getting and what you were involved in, in the independence of Venda, was not actually independence, so you wanted to free yourselves from this so-called independence so that you can go back to the original South Africa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> What sort of discussions were you holding at these meetings when you held them with your peers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI::</span> What we expected, we expected a good life whereby we could get a free education; free health services and all the things that we have been promised as the new dispensation was to come around.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Okay.  And who was Edward Mahvunga, if you could explain to the Committee so the Committee understands exactly, so that even when you get questions from the other side, the Committee understands what you are talking about.  Who was Edward Mahvunga.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Edward Mahvunga, he was a relative of Mr Adam Mahvunga, the headman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> A relative in what sense?</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> I think they share the same grandfathers, as I can understand.  But I don't know whether it was an uncle or a grandfather, but I think there was relationship between the two.  ...(end of tape)</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Now what sort of role would you say Edward played in the community?</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> He was just a commoner.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> I see.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> As I can motivate by this, he was a commoner in that if he was a distinguished person in the community, he could not have stopped us from having free political activities at the village as he did by confronting us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Okay, let's take it step by step.  What I've asked you is whether Edward Mahvunga had any significant role to play in the community, that's what I want you to give to the Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Now, what sort of work did he do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> He was a farmer, as I can say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> What did he farm with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> He used to farm onion.  He was farming onions and fruits.  He was not a cattle farmer, he was not a good farmer, he was not a stupid farmer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Okay.  Now when you held these meetings, did you have anything to do with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> No not particularly.  What we have done that concerned him is when we touched the issue of doing away with the witches as we perceived them as obstacles that were making the then Venda government ...(indistinct) at the time, as we have stated the case of ritual murders and the likes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You explain to us what you mean by that, or what you understood by that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> I beg your pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You say that there was a decision to kill the witches, wizards, why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> In the rural villages it was different from urban areas.  In the rural areas we grew up with the belief that there are witches surrounding us.  They are people who have the power to practice supernatural powers that we cannot see by our naked eyes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Just go slowly please, because this is very important what you are telling us and realise too that you should think carefully what you're saying because it's very important what you are telling us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> You said, in our area we believed that there were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> We grew up in the belief that there are witches, those who have been endowed with supernatural powers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Who, specify who you are referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> The witches.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Now you've explained to the Committee that you grew up believing, from what you learned, that they were practising witchcraft.  Now I want you to explain to the Committee who you are talking about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> I am talking about the witches, those we have said we have to eliminate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> But give us the names of one or two or whoever.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> One such a witch was Mutshinya Tshinakaho, she was one of the witches which were pointed out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Can you just spell that for us please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Yes.  T - S - H - I - N - A - K - A - H - O</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a>Mutshinya is  M - U - T - S - H - I - N - Y - A.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Now who else are you talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> One was Miss Muravha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Muravha is M - U - R - A - V - H - A</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now why did you people want to kill these people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Our main aim was not to kill these people, we just wanted to get rid of those witches, whether by banishment or just by trying to make them confess to their evil deeds, so that we can be aware of what is going on around us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> After pinpointing those people ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But why did you want to get rid of them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> There used to be a time when people were crying "So-and-so has bewitched so-and-so, so-and-so has got Zombies also" so those talks they were the ones that made us to wonder, what are they talking about, what is happening, what can be the cause, what can be done?  So those were the questions we asked ourselves first.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What has that got to do with your freedoms of free medical care and free education?</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> It came to that because those witches, they were believed to have strange powers because we used to believe that those witches, they have got everything.  That's how we used to understand things about the witches.  They were super humans.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So?</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> So sometimes you found that they were jealous, they inflict diseases on other people, they are causing death to other people.  They were crippling people somehow, so they felt that before we get this freedom we are talking about, we must be free of ills amongst us, that's why we said that those witches have to be eliminated before we get that freedom because it is no use getting freedom with obstacles on our doorsteps.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Now how did you come across the deceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> The time when we cam across the deceased was the time when we were coming from one such rally in Thohoyandou.  It was at about, round  half past 5 to 6.  We were gathered at the school soccer ground at the time.  We were about to address the people who stayed behind, of how ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Yes please, you should go slower because I've got to write down what you're saying, and if I can't write it down I can't remember what you were saying, so it's very important that we write down what you're saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> I'm sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> You started off by saying that you came across the deceased while you had a meeting or a rally at a school.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> We were coming from a rally.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> So during that time we were chanting freedom songs.  So then we heard a voice shouting.  The voice was shouting "who are you, who's there?"  So after that we stood still, no one was chanting.  We were expecting that voice to come forward.  Then after a time we heard that the voice was not coming nearer and that made us wonder who can be this person who is shouting at us and then failed to show himself or herself.  Then we heard the voice again.  The voice was saying "Are you the comrades?  What do you think you're going to come up with in my place?  In my place I don't have freedom fighters, I don't have comrades and I don't like comrades at all."  Then we realised that the voice belonged to Mr Edward Mahvunga.  So, he wanted to know what was the real reason why we converged at the soccer ground at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Did he come to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> No, he was not close to us, he was on the footpath.  And then we told him we are chanting because we are happy.  The big man has been released.  By the big man I am referring to Mr Nelson Mandela.  Then he asked us "Who is this Mandela?"  and then we tried to elaborate to him who is he.  Then he told us it is his first time to hear such name being announced in his place, so he don't appreciate hearing such things because he is not a politician, he is not a comrade.  We just gave him a passing glance and thought that maybe he is disturbed.  The next day when we held another meeting again, he came back again saying "Oh, it's that meeting again" so we told him what we are doing does not concern him, then he said "I think I'll be hearing for the last time, because I don't appreciate the idea of comrades chanting when we are asleep".</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> What time of the day or night was it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> It was about half past 6, 7 in the evening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a>And again he was dismissed as someone who was not in full command of his senses but then he said he is going to take major steps to see that these things, it is going to be put in hand, the thing of our chanting all around the village.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Did he tell you he's going to take steps?</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Yes.  Then, when we were about to hold the third meeting,</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> It was three or four days after that meeting, we thought of holding that meeting I'm talking about now, the third one, on a mountain so that maybe it will be safer or maybe he won't hear us chanting on the mountain.</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Why did it worry you that he should not hear you chanting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> I beg your pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Why did it worry you that he should not hear you chanting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> I don't know what he was worried about because we tried to ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, why did you worry about him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> The problem was one, he was the one who was concerned about our chanting and all those meetings that were taking place in our village.</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Yes, but the question is, why did you deem it necessary to move and actually hold a meeting on the mountain in order to get away from him.  Why was it necessary?</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> We thought, maybe, because he is the one who is pestering us with his questions and all the likes, we have to give him room, if he wants to be the boss of this village, then we have to leave him in the village, then we must go on the mountain and there we will have to hold our meetings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> But you were asked several times what was his position in the community and you said he was a commoner.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Yes, he was just a commoner.</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> So why was it necessary to go away from him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> In fact he was an aggressive someone, because he used to have some confrontation with the headman also.  People were not in favour of him as such because he was having negative attitudes towards everything the village agreed upon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> But where would you hold these meetings I mean where he would hear you?  Was it not at the stadium.</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> No, it was in the soccer field at home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He wouldn't hear you from the soccer field?</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> It's not far from his place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What the question is directed at is, why were you scared of him, what was so special about him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> We were afraid of the major steps he had promised us that he was going to take.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why did you think he was capable of doing that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> We used to know him because he was an aggressive person and we knew whenever he said something, he meant it, so we didn't take chances.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> And how did he himself perceive himself to be amongst the people of Mahvunga?</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> There was a saying that, he used to say that he has been robbed of the chieftainship, he should have been the headman in fact.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> So what you are saying is that he regarded himself as the headman of the area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Yes, that's why he was trying to tell us no, I don't want to hear you chanting all around here because it makes me angry whenever I hear comrades chanting and all the likes, because we know the headman himself he was tolerant to what we were doing, but he himself was against us so we were surprised.</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Let's take it very slowly.  It's very important that the Committee understands exactly what you are saying.  Now as I understood your evidence, the headman works in Johannesburg, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Of course.</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> The real headman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> That's what you have told the Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Sorry who was he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who was the headman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Oh, he mentioned his name, Adam Mahvunga.</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Adam?</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Oh yes, they had a common uncle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Yes.  So when Adam Mahvunga is in Johannesburg, Edward perceived himself to be the leader in the area, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN RENSBURG:</span> Mr Chairman, I think I have to object to that question, I don't think that was what the evidence was.  The evidence was that he would have liked to have seen himself as the headman.  That was the evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Yes, that's why I say he perceived.  I think the word perceives, it makes a great difference there.  He perceived himself to be the leader of the people in the area.  I didn't say that he was the leader, I said he perceived.</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He assumed the leadership when the real headman was gone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Yes, that is so.  You can proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How did he do that?  What did he do to indicate or to demonstrate that he had assumed this position on this pedestal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Sometimes we used to, whenever there is something that the Committee have to hear, there is the second man to the headman, he is called Jonas Radsidau, he is the one the headman used to assign if there is some sort of duties to be one in the headman's kraal, so when we used to hear that voice of the second man of the headman, the other day we heard the deceased's voice calling instructions to the whole village, the voice chanting around, "who has ever heard about those boys coming from nowhere and chanting, are these the boys from this area, when we expect the boys from this area to be far away from these activities".  So that's how we come to realise that okay, he was about to take the helm of the country, so we have to give him room and go to the mountain to hold our meetings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, carry one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Yes, that day of the meeting on the mountain, we started about half past four.  We were comprised mainly of males and females, there were boys and girls, numbering at about 200 to 300.  I remember I was the one who was having the meeting at the time.  So when we were busy with the meeting, all of a sudden we hear stones being thrown at us and at that time it was round about 6, 7, 8 in the evening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Where did the stones come from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> No one was having the idea at the time.  We were surprised and we thought maybe it was some of our comrades, they were just trying to scare us, until we realised that the stone throwing was coming from different angles.  So at that time mostly the girls were shouting, "hey, they want to kill us, who might be throwing us with the stones"  They were surprised.  So we boys, we stood up, we made some sort of a defence unit, we made a sort of a kraal and put the girls inside and the boys were outside the crawl so that if the stones were coming they had to hit us, not the girls.  But the stone throwing didn't stop.  It is then that we realised that we are in danger.  If we stay here one of us will have to be carried down the mountain or we will leave some sort of a corpse.</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Who was throwing the stones?  Let's just try and move forward.</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> At that time we were not aware who was throwing the stones.</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you find out eventually who threw the stones?</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Yes, I'm coming to that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well let's get to that then, that's what your attorney is asking you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Okay.  So when we got down the mountain, we were running.  We were running to safety because the mountain was nearest to the village, so whenever we crossed the wire dividing the village from the mountain, we landed in the village.  So it's then that we realised that there was the deceased and he was not alone, he was with his sons and he's got four sons, if I'm not mistaken.  So when we get down from the mountain we found that he had already assaulted most of the girls and they were shouting his name,  Edward, you are hurting us, Edward you are hurting us, so it is then that we realised that it is the deceased who was ambushing us with his sons and they were using slings.  Those stones were being thrown from slings, not from just hands.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> So he and his four sons attacked 200 - 300 people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Yes.  Then we ran away because it was in the night.  There was no time of protecting yourself because you were not having any idea where you are on the mountain because we were afraid of getting hurt, that's why we tried to run away from them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you got down to the bottom of the mountain into the village, how far from the fence did you see these 5 people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Not even 10 kilometres from there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> 10 kilometres?</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Millimetres, maybe 100 millimetres from the fence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Metres or millimetres?</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Metres, I mean.  I'm sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Now is it 10 or is it 100 or what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> 20 meters, 30 metres from the mountain.</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Before we get into cross-examination, let us just establish approximately how far?</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you know a soccer field?</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> A soccer field?</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, the size of a soccer field, it's about 100 metres.</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> It's from one goal post to the centre.</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So that's 50?</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you satisfied that's the distance now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now, could you see them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Yes, we could see and hear their voices.</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, I'm asking could you see them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Not exactly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So how did you know it's them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> We the boys, we were at the back.  What we heard is the voices from the girls who were shouting,  Edward you are hurting us and they were also calling the names of the boys who were beating them at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now you mentioned in your evidence that they had used slings to throw these stones.</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you see any of these slings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Yes, of course.</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How did you see it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I saw, when I was coming down the mountain, there was another, there was one of the sons, he was chasing one of the girls and she was shouting his name.  The sling was hanging through his trouser's loop and then on the other hand he was carrying a sjambok, which he was using to sjambok the lady that was running away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now I want to ask you something.  Did you see the son?</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> I saw one of them, I didn't see all of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What was his name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Ndanganeni Mahvunga.</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you could clearly see him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">PROF RALUSHAI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In that dark?</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> It was not dark at 7 at summertime.</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You were able also to see the sling and the sjambok?</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Yes, I saw the sling, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just spell the name of that son please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Let's use Eric, Eric Mahvunga.</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> N - D - A - N - G - A - N - E - N - I</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> You can proceed.  There you were seeing Edward's son Eric carrying a sling and chasing one of the girls with a sjambok and then what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> From that time we were all down the mountain at that time, so we were starting to inquire from those who were next, I mean, it was not that dark for the people to be asleep at that time.  The people were not asleep, so whenever we get down the mountain we met those people from their homes who were afraid of what is going on in the mountain because they heard children's voices crying, the girls shouting, "hey we are dying, hey we are being hurt" and the likes, those were the people who were waiting for us when we got down the mountain.</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Yes proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> So from there we started to gather information as to what was going on exactly.  Then we realised that the deceased and his sons, when they were ambushing us, they went past those families we were inquiring from, they're the ones who came to realise this is the one who was ambushing the kids in the mountain.  Then the people gave us enough information to pin down the deceased and his sons with the assault.</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> How did you pin them down?</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> They are the ones who told us it is the deceased and his sons.  As I indicated earlier on, that I have seen one Eric Mahvunga, the deceased's son.</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> From there we dispersed to our respective homes on that day.  No political activity took place that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Then the day after the incident of the assault, we found it hard to assemble, as the girls especially they were afraid of being sjamboked again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> After that incident the village found it hard to accept that a single individual, accompanied by his sons, can just attack a mob of about 300 youths, aimlessly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> What did they do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> So, the villagers held a big meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> And when you say villagers, are you referring to both old and young?</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Yes, the whole village.  So when they held that meeting they wanted to know what was the cause behind the assaulting of the youth by the deceased and his sons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When did this meeting take place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Where?</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When and where, yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> The day after the incident of this assault at about 3, 4 in the afternoon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> So, the people came with different ideas and different solutions to the problems facing the youth, as the youth felt that they cannot be held ransom to their freedom they are longing for, because the assault itself had served the youth as a clear indication that their political  activities was a problem to the deceased as he has proved it by assaulting the youth as such.  So the people thought the best way to deal with the deceased was that we have to go to the headman and seek the "trek pass" so that he must be banished from the village.  So the headman came back from the Reef.  So he was made aware of the incident that took place in his absence.  So after hearing what had taken place he asked the people, "what do you think is going to be done because you are here asking me as the headman to come up with the solutions for us to live together as a village after what has happened," I am referring to the assault here.  So the people came to the conclusion that it is better for the deceased to leave the village because he was against our quest for freedom as he was still living in the dark ages, he was not aware of what is taking place.  I mean he was not aware of what was taking place at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> And did the headman take any action?</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Of course, he is the one who issued the "trek pass" and ordered his second man to go there and give the "trek pass" to the deceased so that he must leave the village.</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Did he leave?</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Do you know why he refused to go?</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> We demanded an explanation as to why he is not thinking of going away from the village.  He said he cannot leave this village, he has worked and sweated for this village, he loved this village so much, he has already built his home and he has got children, he cannot just go and leave his home with wife and children and the like.</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> And did the people accept this explanation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> No, the people said "now you attack the people without coming to disclose your ideas of what was taking place, you just took matters upon your hands and took to sjambok the comrades, so we understand your idea of leaving your house and the children and the wife, but the best way for you to do, you can just take your wife and those small kids and leave those big sons to take care of the house.  As for now we find it difficult to engage in free political activity in your presence.  We are being sjamboked.  Who knows if tomorrow we are going to be killed, as you have already started.   So for us to be free, you have to leave."</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Now who did you want to leave?  Did you want him to leave with his family or did you just want him as an individual to leave?</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> As an individual, because we were not having any grudges against the family as such.</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> What would happen to his family?</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> After he had left?</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Yes, if he were to leave as an individual, what did you expect of his family?</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> We saw that he has got big sons who can take care of themselves.  They were not so young, they can fend for themselves.</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> So after that he said, no, he's not going to leave because he loved the country, he has built his house and he has got wives and small children so we said that now that the man is not going to leave, what are we going to do?  The best way for us to do is to go to the station commander at Dzanani, to call the station commander to come there to advise the man to leave the village, as we desired him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Did the police come?</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Yes, of course.</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> And what did they do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> They wanted to interview the deceased, then he made himself available.  He was there but he told policemen point blank, "I'm not going to leave the village as I love the village and I've already sweated for the village, then I cannot leave my property behind."</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> So we pleaded with the station commander that he must advise the deceased to leave the country because  whenever he try to risk and leave the deceased behind, there's going to be a big problem as the emotions of the people were running high at the time.  So the station commander said  "these matters are out of my hands, I cannot shoulder the responsibilities.   Everywhere I go I find smoke, I find people chanting, I find dead bodies around the world, so this I have to leave and you have to deal with the problem yourselves."</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Then the station commander went away with his escorts and leave us with the deceased.  It is then that the whole village came around the deceased's house and demanded his departure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> And when was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> It was at about 3 to 4 in the afternoon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> When?</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> When?</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Do you still remember the date?</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Not clearly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Okay. You say the village now converged on his house.  What were they going to do there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> They pleaded with him to go, but he refused and the villagers again dispersed and left the man around.</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Then before sunset we heard that the deceased accompanied by his sons, they have devised a scheme with which they are going to deal with the comrades they have seen amongst us, because they regarded there were trouble makers amongst the villagers.  I was one of them, I mean of those who were pointed as trouble makers and so they said I have to be dealt with accordingly.  So what we did is that we saw the deceased with his sons coming from the filling station holding two 20 litres of petrol.  As we have heard that he was going to pay revenge, he was going to burn all those comrades houses, those who were involved in his departure.  Their houses were going to be burned and themselves were going to be dealt with accordingly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Then that was that until the day after the incident of the assault.  Then after that...(intervention</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When did you see him with this petrol?</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> It was the day after the station commander came and pleaded with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When was that?  Look you had, the "trek pass" was issued the day after the assault.  When did the police come?</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> The day after.  Those incidents were happening subsequently day after day, day after day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So two days after the assault the police came?</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes and three days afterwards you saw this petrol in his possession?</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Yes.  The villagers decided that if he is going to attack the comrades that he perceives to be trouble makers, then he is going to kill all of us, so they decided to converge at his kraal.  They went to his kraal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Was that on the same day when he bought the petrol?</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> No the day after he bought the petrol.</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> So that was now the 4th day after on that mountain?</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> The day we saw him carrying the petrol, we, the comrades that were involved at that time, we were pinpointed out say, Roger, Mudau, Masioma, Masithulela, all their houses are going to be burned down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> By whom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> By the deceased and his sons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But who had this hit list?</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> I beg your pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who had these names?</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Who were their names, the comrades?</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> The sons, this Boshoff Mahvunga and the other one is called Aubrey Mahvunga.</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Explain to us how you got to know that they had this list.</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Okay.  During that time the deceased used to have close relatives like the one who is sitting there by the name of Petrus Mahvunga, he is the brother to the deceased as such, so the people like that, they're the ones who were spreading out the rumour, those guys we are going to deal with accordingly.  So during that time of the petrol we took our furniture from our ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So the deceased's family, you say, was telling the villagers what is going to happen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Yes, whenever they came across they say those boys we are going to deal with.  Then we were afraid and our parents were afraid too.  So they ordered us to take out the furniture from our houses and take the furniture to the field, to save the furniture.  We decided that if he is going to burn, he must burn the empty houses, not the furniture.</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> So you also took your furniture out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Yes, of course.</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Then we were waiting for him until we decided that for us to be safe, we have to form self-defence units during that time, during that night of the ambush.</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> I see it's 5 past 4.  Maybe it's an opportune time,</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How long is he going to be more?</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> I think he may still go for another 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Let's see how far he can get.</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> So from then on we guessed that we have to form self-defence units which we did and from what I still recall from his gate up to our places, every corner was manned at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> And why were these corners manned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> We were afraid that he was going to burn our kraals as he was renown for his aggressive attacks.  So from there we waited for him until we realised that he's not coming, then in the morning we conveyed to our different places.  So when we were at our place, they found that the youth, they were against us singing freedom songs because we declared that we are not going to stop our political activities because we wanted freedom and this freedom we will attain by any other means and the man himself cannot be the obstacle, he cannot hold the people ransom because he was still living in the dark ages.  He was against political activities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> For what reason?</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> No one knows.  So we decided that we have to go further for us to gain political activities which is free, then if he is going to ambush us like that, we have to remove him as an obstacle for us to get political independence, I mean to get free political activity, we have to remove him, because he has proven himself to be a danger to the village as such.  So we decided to remove him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Who decided that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> You and whom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> The village as a whole.</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Where was this decided?</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> At the soccer field.   No, no, no excuse me it was not decided by the youth to remove him, so we wanted to make another attempt to remove him from the village, hence we made two attempts and they had failed already, so we converged to his kraal, pleading with him again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Then he told the villagers that he's not going to leave.  He will leave a dead corpse.</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> So then other people asked him, do you say you are not going to leave?  And if we are going to see to it that you are going to leave, you will say you are not going to leave, except that you will be taken out as a dead corpse.  So, you are alone with your sons, you are just a minor to the village as a whole   We are many here, if we want to kill we can kill you now, but if you say that you are not leaving we will see to it that you leave by force. It is then that he declared that "I am not going to leave, I will rather fight."  It is then that the people asked him  "Are you ready to fight?"  He said "Yes, I will fight for my property".  It is then that the people said "Okay, if you are going to fight, show yourself".</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> And where was all this happening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> At his kraal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> So the villagers had converged at his kraal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Definitely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> And you were also there?  You were also there at his kraal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker"> MR RAMASITSI:</span> Of course, I was one of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> In other words when you are saying the villagers you mean both young and old people were there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Yes, and then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> That's when they said "If you are not going to leave, you're going to leave by force" then he said "I'll fight and I'll die for my properties", it is then the people started with throwing stones.</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> And where were his children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> They were with him, including his wife and all the children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> And what were they doing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> They were ready to fight. They were carrying spears, slings and catapults.</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> And they wanted to fight this big crowd of people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Of course.  And it was surprising because 6 people cannot fight more than 2 to 3 000 people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were there 3 000 people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> The whole village is comprised by more than 5 to 7 000 people, so 2 - 3 000 thousand people were there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> And all these people that had gathered there, were there to try and make sure that he was removed from his home, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Yes, they wanted to remove him from the village, from his home.  So the people realised that he was serious and he meant to fight, as he promised to.  So the people said that if he is going to fight, possibly he is going to die.  He won't stand up to more than 3 000 people.  So he decided to strike.  He threw, what was that. what did I say he was carrying, catapults and what?  An arrow, or what?  A spear, I mean it was a spear, he threw a spear into the mass.  That spear triggered the whole incident, then the people started throwing stones at him and his children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> And were these people outside?</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Yes they were outside his fence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> But inside their yard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Inside the yard was himself and his children and his wife.</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> And this big crowd that had gathered there was standing outside?</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Outside and around his home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Now after he had thrown a spear at the crowd, you say, what did the crowd do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> It triggered the crowd to throw stones back at him and his children and his wife too.</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> What did the people do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> They started throwing stones at him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> And what did the stones do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Until one of the stones caught him in the eye and that stone dealt him a big blow so that he was defenceless.  He started to stagger.</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> What time was this now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> About 3 to 4.</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> In the afternoon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> From your evidence it would appear that you had been there for a long time, is that correct?  What time did you arrive at his home that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> The people converged there at about 10 or 11 in the morning, so they whole time from 11, 12, 1, 2 they were trying to plead with him to go.</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> So all these four hours was spent on negotiating, trying to plead with him to go, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Yes, of course.  And when the people realised that he was hurt, they pleaded with the sons to stop fighting and ordered the wife with the kids to go out to the headman's kraal and leave the old man behind, so that the people can finish him because they have already started striking him with stones.</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Just go slowly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> So after that stone that struck him in the eye, it rendered him defenceless.  So the people saw that he was with his sons and the wife, so they ordered the sons to stop fighting because their father now was defenceless.  Then the sons stopped fighting and started to negotiate with the mass, so the mass wanted the mother of the kids, again with the kids to go to the headman's kraal as they have nothing to do with the wife in fact.</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> So what you are saying is that the crowd was now trying to remove the wife and the kids.</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Of course.</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Because they had nothing against them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> All they wanted, the person that they wanted was ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Was the old man himself, because he started the fight.</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Now were the children removed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Of course, together with the wife.</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Yes, and then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Then, the people jumped the fence.  They jumped the fence and got into his own yard.  They wanted to see where he is because from the time he was struck by the stone he staggered inside the house, so they were wondering where might he be.  So when they got in the house they found that he was bleeding and he was no longer able to see clearly because the blood was all over his face and eyes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> So from there, it is then that most of the masses now got into the fence and from there I don't really remember what happened until I still remember seeing one of our comrades carrying the tube from the tractor tyre.  The tube was fetch from the Datsun bakkie, that was back there in the garage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> And what happened to the tube?</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> So from that time the house was already set alight because there was no one inside except the old man himself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Who set the house alight?</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> We set the house alight.</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> You and who?</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> And the comrades who were with me at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Who are those?</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> There were 3 000 comrades.</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Yes, but 3000 people cannot get into the fence, we were about 15 to 20 people who got into the house first.</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> And who are these people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> It's Ravele Philip, Chester Raguala,</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Your co-accused were among them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> All of them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> All of them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Not all of them, and me too, I didn't get into the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But you went to fetch the petrol?</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Yes, I was the one who was organising petrol at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, okay.  All you co-accused, co-applicants, did something actively in respect of this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Of course.</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Now when you say "we lit the fire", did you yourself light the fire?</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> No, I just carried the petrol around for the people who set the house alight.</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> What else did you do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> From there I was trying to tell the people what was their idea from now because the old man seems to be harmless, he was defenceless, he was about to die, so we wanted to hear from the people, are we finishing him, or what, because we have already started the fight now that the old man was defenceless.  So the emotions led us to finish him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Now what else did you do as a person?  You as a person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> I myself, I was busy trying to see that the people get into the house, those who wanted to get into the house, because I was trying to say, the ones who are about to get into the house, they had to be old, not the small kids, because it was no good for small children to see a dead corpse at the time.  We wanted old people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> So apart from siphoning petrol, where did you get the petrol from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> From Ravele's petrol station.</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Oh, so you bought it, you didn't siphon it from someone?</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Yes, we bought it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> So apart from the carrying of the petrol and beckoning people to get into the yard, what else would you say you did actively in participating in the whole saga?</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> I was involved in organising the people, mobilising the people, seeing that the venues of the meetings, I was the one who was organising all those things, the venues of the meetings, the petrol, who is to do what, who was about to go and see who, all those things.</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> I see.  Now we've gone now 9 years back.  Now it is 1999, that happened in 1990.  Now at the time you were 20 years of age.  You've just told the Committee today that you are now 29.</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Of course.</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Have you grown up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Of course?</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> And now what do you think about those events?</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> So what I think of those events at such time, when I start to look at things from a different angle now when I am old like this, I'm so sorry and I feel remorse for what has happened to the family of Mr Edward Mahvunga.</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Ndou, this is not criminal court, remorse is not one of the requirements.</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> That is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I'm happy to hear that he's remorseful, but you ask questions, you may get the wrong answer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Thank you.  I see it is now 20 past 4.</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, carry on, are you going to be more with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Can we proceed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Okay, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We're going to try to finish him tonight.</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDOU:</span> Okay, is there anything else that you want to tell the Committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Yes, I want to tell the Committee to accept that during that time from 1988 as we have already indicated, the situation in Venda as we have already indicated in several ways, was not that normal.  Even we ourselves.</p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We've heard that from the previous witness and you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is there anything that you want to say to the families of the victim?</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Of course.</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Please proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> I want to say that I understand that it is not that easy to face life without a breadwinner at home, so our irresponsibility that led to his being removed from the community, was not that waste, it was the emotions of the people of the time and the time was itself was pregnant so no one about to stop it, we just wanted to do what the time wanted us to do.  So I'm so sorry and those sons, those who are sitting there, I have grown up with, especially Eric and Boshoff.  They were my friends.  We used to share clothes, food and all life, we shared everything in life, so I don't want to see them sitting there saying Roger is responsible for my father's death, so I want to embrace them as my friends.  Since we have started as friends, I want them to finish with friends with me, because I don't have any cry today.  I have learned through bitter experiences, I have been to prison for about 6 years and 6 months, so it has been a learning experience to me also to be alone, thinking about what has happened, that led me being behind bars.   So it was not easy for me too to accept life behind bars.  I have tried my level best to be a responsible person, as I have learned to be responsible, I am responsible till today.  I don't think I will have to make that flaw that I did before.  So I can say thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that all you want to say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAMASITSI:</span> Of course.</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We'll adjourn to 9 a.m. tomorrow morning.</p>
