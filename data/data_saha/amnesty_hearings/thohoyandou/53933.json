If that's the position and he's applying for amnesty for killing the two deceased whether he was convicted or not and he's telling us now that he's applying for that, it's a matter of argument whether it's a good application or not but that's a legal argument.  You could argue that he didn't apply for those offences and therefore we can't grant it.  He's only mentioning it now but that's an argument he can't give us the answer on, it's a legal argument that you'll have to address and we'll have to decide but apart from that it seems to me as though it's sort of common cause that he was present, that he's associated himself with the killings whether he in fact hit the body of a deceased person or hit him just before he'd been certified as dead I don't know but he associated himself with the killing and I think the only thing is why did he kill or why did he associate himself, was it associated with any political purpose or was it something else?",

I'll tell you why, that when people haven't got a legal background completes such application forms it's not to be expected of them to know what's small or how to deal with different crimes and elements of crimes and therefore perhaps we have a sympathetic attitude towards that kind of thing as opposed to an assault charge where it's a separate incident and where nothing of that incident has been mentioned in the application form we can't even have a generous view like that in that case.",

He certainly did not make a logical connection between the killing of the witches and the area or Venda becoming ungovernable.  He certainly gave no logical answer to make the connection how the real enemy, namely apartheid, could be fought by killing the witches and in that sense I would just argue that he did not persuade this hearing in my view that the killings was in fact politically motivated.  That argument would by and large also holds true for the first applicant who in my view was an even weaker witness than the second applicant.  It is clear from his evidence that he blatantly lied on his form, his application form, at least regarding to his age and who knows what else.  It is clear that he was the leader, the chairman of the meeting and it is therefore unlikely that his actual participation in the killing and the burning was so small.  I would suggest that as I've put to him that we have here again a situation where he is trying to mitigate his own involvement in the whole incident and it is also illustrated by the fact that he totally omitted to take this hearing into his confidence regarding the assault, GBH, that took place on that specific day.  \n\tThe first applicant was also not convincing in his explanation as to how the killing of the witches would fulfil any political aim to say the least and in that sense I would conclude that his motivation for this killing was in fact not political, it was probably witchcraft related and the anti-witchcraft feeling was high at that stage which I also plan to illustrate with evidence in a later case but it is also important to take into consideration at this stage the aspect that the learned Chairperson has raised, namely that the killing of the witches has actually not stopped immediately after the election took place and therefore we've got to deduct that it was not politically motivated that it is some other reasons, cultural reasons or purely fear, jealousy, all these reasons could have played a role and I suggest that the evidence rather a point into that direction mainly because the witnesses one after the other struggled to make the connection between the political aim and the killing of the witches.\n\tTo sum up then, I'm of the opinion that these two persons, the applicants, and that is my instructions to request such a finding from the hearing should not qualify for the amnesty as they have applied for.
