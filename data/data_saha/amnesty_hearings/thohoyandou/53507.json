Mr Ramaligela interrogated me in the station commander's office.  And when he became unsatisfied with my verbal statement, he threatened me in several ways.  He said he's aware that I would have preached a dangerous sermon at Chipiwa's funeral if I had not been detained.  But another thing he said was that he would go beyond all the torture methods used on me previously in my earlier detentions by crushing my private parts to entertain the woman who was travelling with him.

On the 4th, amongst other torture methods, he and Managa and Rambuda forced me on my back and forced me to raise my legs and Ramaligela personally jumped on my private parts.  He made it clear he wanted to crush my manhood once and for all.  Further attempts were to no avail because every time he jumped I rolled.  On 5 January, the electric shocks started with the earlobes, they moved to the toes and to the thighs and ultimately to my private parts.  I did show the electric marks on my private parts to several people.  Former magistrate Samuel Makige and Chandama did see that, the doctors at Chilitsini Hospital, I did show them the electric shock marks, especially on my testicles.  I did report this to the International Red Cross team that visited me at the hospital.  I did report this, amongst others to the then attorney-general.  And when I laid charges against the Security Police while in hospital, I did mention amongst others this assault on my private parts.  Throughout my life, since that experience, I did not fail to mention this atrocious attack.  Your Worship, in my three books, especially in this one I have here, 'Diary From a South African Prison' written for the first time in 1985 in German, and later, '87, in English, I describe all the tortures.  The Security Police note themselves they did interrogate me why I did write this book.  So, in conclusion, to cut a long story short, it is the most painful, atrocious lie and a very serious conspiracy among the Security Police to deny their deliberate focus on private parts as one of the most effective ways of achieving whatever intended goals they had.

At the end of that interrogation, they provided me with stationery to write farewell to my bishop, my family and everybody and made it very clear that they wanted to kill me and throw my body in Mozambique.  I almost wrote but decided not to, the threats to torture me slowly until I die did come on 4 January but, some few methods they didn't mention, Managa, Ramaligela and Rambuda who's name was never mentioned by them here, Mr Rambuda, they did not mention literally banging my head against the wall.  It was terrible.  They did not tell you how they pulled my hair and my beard.  They did not tell you how they lifted me, threw me into the air to fall on the concrete floor.  They mentioned sticks but they forgot to mention chairs.  And it's a said chapter that they said there were light injuries.

They failed to mention, amongst others, the name of Mr Matjena who ridiculed me tremendously throughout the process.

And during the torture he came to mock me and he's one of those, I think if I'm not mistaken, who on 8 February 1982, together with - their names they forget conveniently, captain Bezuidenhout who tried to take me to the Magistrate Court and on that day I saw some of my colleagues around the Magistrate Court but, after that, Col Kruger decided I'm not going to go into that court and he took me to Mathatshe or Venda Central Prison.  He played a critical role in hospital because he together with Gerson Ramaburana, after I laid charges against the police, they came to intimidate me and force me to suspend the charges until further notice.  And made it very clear to me that unless I withdrew the charges, they would be forced to chose between me and their Security Police.  And the choice was obvious.  What's also critic is the conspiracy to deny the extent of injuries.  So summarise my own injuries, when I landed at Chilitsini Hospital on 7 January, your Worship, my head was this swollen and Gabriel Ramushwana saw it.  Ramaligela, Managa, Nesamari, they saw it.  My eyes were this swollen and red with blood.  Literally, your Worship, I was breathing through my ears, my mouth was swollen.  Your Worship, if I stood before you there, you can still see marks on my knees, there were deep wounds into which I could put the tips of my fingers.  And the Security Police must tell you what they did with my medical records ...(indistinct) in hospital where I spent all together 106 days.  The X-ray copies would tell you a story what happened to my ribs.  During that time, Mr ...(indistinct) would tell the papers that I was in hospital because I had a headache.  So, I'm not surprised at this minimising of the injuries that we went through.  The station commander, Mr Rambuda, who I saw is here.  He helped nurse my wounds when I was at Sibasa police station.  So, the intensity of the torture was such that my treatment did not only end at Chilitsini, your Worship.  In recuperation I went to the Western Cape, my wife remembers me collapsing at night and being rushed to Victoria Hospital.  I went to Groote Schuur Hospital as follow up to electric shock treatment.  At Venda Central Prison, when I collapsed, my colleagues are here like Chipiwa Mahumela who helped pressurise the police until I was returned to hospital.  Your Worship, I cannot exhaust this story.  Now, one thing they must still tell us, when I was rushed to Madimbo Military Hospital, it was after I received my clothes from home and I suspect some poisoning of those clothes because, it happened both at Masisi and at Venda Central Prison, and every time after I received clothes from home, and when I was transferred from Madimbo Military Hospital to Chilitsini Hospital again, I asked the police to take along all the medicines I got from the military ...(intervention)",

I felt very weak, I felt dizzy, the ordinary police noticed it and they rushed me to Madimbo where I got two injections, one injection on each buttocks.  And a gargling liquid and some pills.  Come 2 February, I collapsed, my heart palpitated, shortage of breath, I needed water every minute or two.  Let me once again thank the local police, were it not for them, I would have died on that spot.  And they rushed me back to Madimbo.  The doctor came to the van and he said 'Is this the guy who was here yesterday?'  The police said yes.  He gave me a blue pill and water and said 'Rush him to the nearest hospital.'  I remember his words, 'He will...' and he hesitated and said 'He may die.'  And I was rushed back to Chilitsini Hospital.  Now, when I changed into hospital clothes, life would return to normal.  The same when I collapsed at Venda Central Prison.  When I got to hospital and changed into hospital clothes, I would feel okay.  This suspicion, I must be very honest with you, comes after the stories around the poisoning of Rev Chikane's clothes.

Apart from electric and physical torture, coming to my own case, and I don't want to speak for others but I must mentioned I saw Caviar on, I think it was 8 February who was put in my cell.  He was this swollen and that was after he saw me at hospital and tried to follow the police van.  Until contrary information, I'll take it it is not true that he was not arrested in connection with the Sibasa police station.  Now, let me come back.  In my case, amongst other things they used at Sibasa torture centre, they would knee me in the groin.  Ramaligela, Managa and others, they would knee me in the groin.  They would bring a team of young boys, I think they were Security Police trainees who would come and laugh and mock you.  I'm surprised they forget that expert team.  Now the other thing they used are handcuffs.  You see, I was handcuffed to the back and the handcuffs cut into the flesh, the marks are still visible on my wrists.  Now, what's also interesting, and that's why I question their political motives sometimes, Gabriel Ramushwana told you that he doesn't know why I was detained.  And what he told you is true.  On 7 January 1982, he came to my cell in the company of two youngsters, he sent them out and he said to me 'We know that you innocent in this whole matter.  All our good pastors are going to die but look, just write what we want because otherwise you will die.'  So partly, the story he told you is true.  And also Ramushwana did play a role in the writing of statements, in my first statement, when he came with it for me to sign, I found new paragraphs which I never wrote.  Among the paragraphs was the one that said 'Chipiwa Mohape participated in the bombing of the police station.'  In spite of all the pains I'd gone through, in spite of all the false confessions I was forced to make, I was not prepared to be accessory to the lie that would justify Isaac Chipiwa Mohape's death.  And I resisted.  Mr Ramushwana left and came back and said 'Sorry, it was a typing error.'  Typing error that brings a new paragraph all together into the statement.  There were more paragraphs to which I objected and he told me 'This is enough, we can't remove anything any further.  Otherwise it will create problems.'",

But, in spite of some of the statements that they are sorry, they regret, the evidence on the floor hides critical elements of information.  Perhaps I should conclude by saying what I'm saying to you I'm not saying here for the sake of amnesty or being against amnesty.  My books, 'Diary From South African Prison,' 'Justice in My Tears,' it addresses Isaac Mohape, it address Nesamari, my congregate and others.  The book 'In Transit' addresses these issues.  There's a video, 'Torture of a South African Pastor' produced by the Lutheran ...(indistinct) Federation in Geneva.

He, Mr Ramaligela, was in charge of the interrogation team.  He told me that 'You can also appeal to your God, he never helps some of the people who went through this room.'\n\tShocks were applied all over the body, including my private parts and Ramaligela even mentioned to me that if you haven't given birth, it will never come.  This process went on I think from about 09h00 in the morning to say immediately before 20h00 in the evening.\n\tWhen they found that they were about to fail to get information, that's when Nesamari said 'Give him to me.'  Then he connected electrodes to my private parts, my groin and my earlobes at the same time.  Then, during that period I felt as if my body was separating in half.  That's when I agreed to give the evidence they wanted which I wrote.\n\tThen Mosishiwa took it to Gabriel Ramushwana and when he came back to me, Gabriel Ramushwana, and said to me 'Why did you have to lie?', I said to him 'Bra Gabe, this is what I had to say.'  Then he turned to Ramaligela and said to him 'Ons is in groot kak.  This whole thing is a whole big lie.'  Then I was taken bag to Tsanane police station.\n\tSubsequent to that, I was taken to Slome Hospital because some of the police members at Tsanane police station were concerned about the state of my health.  I was urinating black urine and I appeared to be deranged, mentally.  On arriving at the hospital, I collapsed in the consulting room.  That's when I was admitted.
