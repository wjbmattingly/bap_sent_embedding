            "My attitude towards the applicants is that all their hands have killed.  There is no one who is innocent.  Your presence in the planning shows that you are part of that killing.\n\tTherefore I am not satisfied at all that they should be given amnesty.  Because our children has been killed.  If you have killed, if you have taken the blood from the body, you have killed.  With the attitude - they kill and destroy the body so that the relatives should not be able to identify that is the thing which breaks my heart as a mother.\n\tMy child left the country when he was 17 years old in 1976.  When he returned when he was 27 years old, he was called a terrorist.  But his history I am heartbroken because I am not able to reveal his history, what kind of a person he was.\n\tMy child was not a terrorist.  And the way he was killed, many people were heartbroken.  Because of that, I have requests which I want to make in regard to the killing.\n\tFirstly I was heartbroken that I am not even able to have his photo which shows the whole body.  Up to yesterday when we were given those photo's.  I am requesting those photo's.  Those are my child's photo's.\n\tI am requesting the tape recorder, so that I should listen to that tape because when I look at that photo, that is my child.  I suffered the rest of my life and I want to suffer the rest of my life, looking at those photo's and listening that I should not been told that the tape has been lost.\n\tThe other thing which I wanted to comfort my heart is that in all this ten years, we were harassed together with my children.  My daughter with whom I am today, had to leave teaching because the police should listen to the students, how they read history.\n\tMy eldest son left for 10 years, he only arrived in 1992.  Today you see the condition of his father, he has been affected by many diseases and he was forced to retire before the right time.  All the time I used to go up and down with my children, trying to search for schools where they should attend because our name has been (indistinct) because we are called terrorists.\n\tThe other request which I want to make Mr MC, with humility, I request that the person who is in Botswana who is called Mabila, who was gathering our children so that they should cross the border to be killed at the ditch, my husband went with my daughter to the place of slaughter, we want to see Mr Mabila so that he should see us and listen to what we would say to him.\n\tBecause we lived under terrible conditions.  Because we were not treated fairly.  I have papers that when I buried my child, the police were harassing us because in our tradition if you are a mother, the mother is not taken up and down, but they took me to places and my husband was not going to tell, the grandmother of the child, they took me from the bedroom, I left my blankets in that fashion.\n\tI was taken to the police station so that they gave me instructions about the number of people who should attend the funeral.  I have all those documents.\n\tYou would forgive me if I am taking a long time, because I want to move the pain inside.  But if I maybe given the tape to listen to, that tape, because Monti was not a terrorist.\n\tHe has his own voice, I am requesting that with humility.  My colleagues whose children died, Mr Mogashoa and Mr Alset and the other three who were not identified, I confirm what they have said, but I make a request that those three should be exhumed, because they are South African heroes.\n\tThey fought and they have changed this country to what it is today, that they should be reburied to where Mr Slovo has been buried.  And their photo's should be published in the papers, and they should be shown on the TV so that their parents are always waiting for them to come back.  Maybe they are still at school or doing something.\n\tNothing has been done.  That is my request Mr Chairperson.  The other request because I don't know as whether it would be possible in South Africa, it is the police, it is in regard to the police.  We don't have the police in South Africa, we are still afraid of them.  Especially us who went through that kind of an experience.\n\tBecause all the time they would paint you black, all the time.",

We don't know what the answer is, but we do feel Mr Chairman, that these gentlemen who have come to you to give their evidence, did so in honesty and in truthfulness, you will be the judge of that at the end of the day.\t\n\tAt some stage or other Mr Chairman, something will have to be done about this, because a distorted picture might be sent into the world and people may read in the newspapers about these gentlemen whom they know, to be murderers and if that is, if the Act leaves that scope Mr Chairman, then something is drastically wrong.\n\tWe just want to make that statement and leave it at that Mr Chairman.",

This process is meant exactly for murderers and people expect that people who come to apply for amnesty, are self-confessed murderers, that is why they want amnesty.\n\tAnd amnesty is not just there for, you know, it must be given in accordance with the law.  And there maybe some other prices to pay and as I understand the law and this is my personal view, I am not expressing the views of the Committee, there is a price to pay for getting amnesty.\n\tYou are expected to come publicly, in front of the nation and the rest of the world to acknowledge publicly that you have murdered people.  If you feel you have not committed any murder at all, then you haven't done anything wrong, you have nothing to apply amnesty for, one would have thought that you wouldn't come, but if you come, you want amnesty, you are expected to give full disclosure and in fact to acknowledge that you have committed a crime on a public platform, so that you could get amnesty.\n\tNow, coming publicly to say and confess that you have committed murder, and then later complain when people say oh, you were in fact a murderer, I don't understand the nature of the complaint.\n\tWe are not here to listen to innocent people.
