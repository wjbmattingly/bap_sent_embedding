<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>CHAIRMAN:	It is the 3rd of July, 1997.  We are proceeding with the same matter of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a>Sehlwana, Erwee and others.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a>	I notice Mr Black is not here.  Although we agreed yesterday that we would </p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a>start at nine o'clock, it is past nine o'clock, it is nearly ten o'clock and I think we should </p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a>proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a>	Colonel, you are still under oath.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a>ANDRIES JOHANNES GERHARDUS ERWEE:	(still under oath)</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a>ADV VISSER:	Mr Chairman, before we commence with the continuation of Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a>Erwee's evidence, you will allow me to make a statement.  Those of the members who </p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a>had the misfortune of watching the news on television news last night, concerning the </p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a>report of the evidence of Mr Erwee yesterday, would have been struck by the </p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a>inaccuracy of that report.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a>	Mr Chairman, we feel that it is necessary in view of what we are trying to do </p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a>here, we are trying to establish a complete a picture as possible of gross violations of </p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a>human rights, during the conflicts of the past and it has struck us very forcefully that </p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a>this type of journalism which we saw on TV last night, is not conducive to you being </p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a>able to render your task sufficiently.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a>	If you hadn't seen that news report Mr Chairman, may I just tell you that ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a>CHAIRMAN:	I personally didn't, but I assume my colleagues did not.  Do you mean </p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a>the eight o'clock news?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a>ADV VISSER:	Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a>CHAIRMAN:	No, I didn't watch it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a>ADV VISSER:	May I just tell you what was stated?  The sum total of what was stated </p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a>Mr Chairman was that Mr Erwee admitted "to firing 30 shots into a combi which was </p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a>carrying six cadres, MK - well six cadres and that this was done during an ambush by </p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a>the Security Forces of these people."  </p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a>	Not a word was breathed Mr Chairman about the background, about the fact </p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a>that Mr Erwee stated that it was a question of returning fire after the SADF officer </p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a>was wounded.  Mr Chairman, apart from the fact that Mr Erwee was made out quite </p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a>clearly as the villain of the situation, it goes much wider than that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a>	Your efforts here to establish the truth Mr Chairman, is seriously jeopardised </p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a>because if witnesses feel that they are going to be allowed to be misquoted this way, it </p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a>may very well jeopardise them coming forward, their willingness to come forward.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a>	I will take it no further, I just want to place it on record and I want to invite the </p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a>SABC to rectify their poor and inaccurate reporting tonight with the same prominence </p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a>as they did last night and apart from that, I don't want to say anything more about it </p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a>Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a>	Mr Erwee, is still under cross-examination.  Mr Chairman, there is just one </p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a>issue which we feel we should draw to your attention.  Ms Khampepe, yesterday </p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a>afternoon just at the close of the proceedings, put a question ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a>CHAIRMAN:	I remember it, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a>ADV VISSER:	And my Attorney tells me, he was listening to the Afrikaans </p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a>translation, I didn't have my earphones on, so I don't know, but in so far as there might </p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a>be some confusion as to what  was translated, without reflection on the interpreter at </p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a>all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a>	We wondered whether we could impose on Ms Khampepe to put those </p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a>questions again, so that we can get absolute clarity about what was asked and how the </p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a>question was answered.  I may inform you Mr Chairman, that I didn't discuss this with </p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a>Mr Erwee at all, because I thought it would be improper for me to talk to him while he </p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a>is under cross-examination, so whatever his answers were, Mr Chairman, I didn't </p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a>discuss with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a>	But if Ms Khampepe wouldn't mind, just putting those questions again and I </p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a>can remind you if you don't remember what it was, it had to do with the question of </p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a>reasonable force and it had to do with the question of whether it fell within the ambit </p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a>of the instructions, I think that was the point.  If you don't mind, Ms Khampepe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a>MS KHAMPEPE:	Thank you Mr Visser.  I may not be able to ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a>CHAIRMAN:	Sorry, let me just interrupt.  Mr Visser, you are saying that because </p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a>you didn't quite follow the answers, I suppose, though if I were the applicant I would </p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a>have been happy with the answers that I had given, but any way, let he continue with </p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a>the questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a>ADV VISSER:	Again Mr Chairman, we are here to discover what actually happened, </p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a>what the truth is.  Whether it was in his favour or if they were the correct replies, we </p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a>are confused as to what the answers were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a>MS KHAMPEPE:	Thank you Mr Visser.  I think my questions that I will put to </p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a>Mr Erwee, will not be the same word for word, that is as yesterday, because I didn't </p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a>have them written out, but I think your problem is with regard to the two last </p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a>questions which were put to him with regard to the kind of force, reasonable force </p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a>which he applied in the incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a>	I will proceed then to put that question to Mr Erwee.  Mr Erwee, I think what </p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a>I asked you yesterday was whether in your planning, since you had anticipated some </p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a>kind of resistance from the six cadres, in an endeavour to arrest them, my question was </p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a>whether you had taken any measures to ensure that minimum force was used by you </p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a>and your members in defending yourselves against the attack by the six cadres in that </p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a>minibus, that was my first question.  At least the first of the last two.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a>MR ERWEE:	Chairperson, I think I have understood the question correctly.  When it </p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a>was said to me that the insurgents are busy crossing the border and that they were </p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a>carrying bags with them, the observation post didn't notify me whether the people had </p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a>their firearms outside and that reassured me that the planning would fall within the </p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a>framework of our planning, because it would have been an unheard of thing for </p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a>insurgents to drive around, showing their firearms openly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a>	It would have been very risky.  For that reason, I believed that when we </p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a>stopped the vehicle and threw the hand grenade to cause shock and confusion, that by </p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a>the time the insurgents have taken out their firearms, cocked them, etc, that they at </p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a>that stage already would have realised that here is an armed vehicle and weapons are </p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a>aimed at us, uniformed people surrounding us etc.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a>	That is why I believed that we will be able to arrest the insurgents without </p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a>them really offering any resistance and then when I saw through the window how the </p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a>passenger in the left front shot through the window and that Captain Born collapsed, </p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a>and I then also heard a short volley of shots, it is true we are trained, I myself am </p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a>trained in the case of contact with insurgents, you deliver maximum fire power to </p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a>protect your own life and not as in the normal situation.  You are trained in that </p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a>situation, to give the maximum fire until there is no resistance left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a>	I must also mention it to the Chairperson, that when I started firing, I fired at </p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a>the combi and at the passengers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a>	There was teargas so I couldn't see very clearly, I couldn't see very clearly </p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a>where each person, each passenger was sitting, I just fired.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a>MS KHAMPEPE:	And in your opinion, do you think that you then were able to </p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a>carry out the instructions which were given to you by Mr Van der Merwe or by Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a>Coetzee, who both were your superiors at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a>MR ERWEE:	If I understood the question correctly, I believed when I started </p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a>shooting, that I had exceeded the bounds of my instruction, namely that I should arrest </p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a>first and then should we encounter fire, only then fire back and that we shouldn't </p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a>endanger our lives.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a>	Then that is correct, when I started shooting, I shot to protect our own lives.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a>MS KHAMPEPE:	Mr Visser, I think in short that would be the context of some </p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a>of the questions which were put to Mr Erwee, but your concern was mainly with </p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a>regard to the two last questions, which were put to him and I hope that really satisfies </p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a>your concerns.  Do they meet your concerns?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a>ADV VISSER:	We do appreciate it Mr Chairman.  I was clearly wrong, and my </p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a>Attorney was correct in his recollection of what the evidence was, thank you Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a>Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a>CHAIRMAN:	I should have mentioned that Mr Black has since come in.  I assume he </p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a>has obviously some good reason why he was late and we will accept in advance that </p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a>explanation.  You found us busy already Mr Black, because we couldn't wait.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a>	If I could just ask you - the person who survived and later died, was </p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a>questioned and he did give some information like for example he said they were to </p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a>meet somebody in Pietersburg at the station, and he described the kind of clothing that </p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a>would distinguish that particular person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a>MR ERWEE:	That is correct Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a>CHAIRMAN:	And was he also asked where they were from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a>MR ERWEE:	I did not get an interpretation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a>CHAIRMAN:	Was he also asked as to where they were coming from?  I just want to </p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a>confirm that with you, because there was some evidence that he was asked where they </p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a>were coming from and then he said they were coming from Botswana, I just want to </p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a>confirm whether that is in fact also your evidence or your recollection.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a>MR ERWEE:	I can't remember, but I assumed that he came from Botswana.  The </p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a>questions which I pertinently put to him were where are you going and then he said the </p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a>railway station and then I asked now, who are you supposed to meet there, why the </p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a>railway station and he then said to me, I have to meet somebody there wearing a </p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a>yellow shirt or a yellow bag or something.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a>	This person would familiarise themselves further with accommodation and so </p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a>on.  But this person wasn't fully conscious, it was almost a dying declaration because </p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a>he was muttering and he kept losing consciousness and coming to again and that is </p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a>why after about three or four minutes, I asked the Medic from the Defence Force to </p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a>inject him to stabilise him because it was important to determine who this person was </p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a>who was waiting at the railway station.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a>	When I got to Alldays, my first action was to contact Colonel Willem van der </p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a>Merwe and to tell him that the incident had not turned out well and that the person had </p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a>died on the way.  And that he had given this information about the railway station.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a>	I made a request that Colonel Willem should send out people to the railway </p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a>station.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a>CHAIRMAN:	The impression I got from the evidence of Mr Sehlwana was that after </p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a>this person gave some information, and just after he had given all this information </p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a>which looked important, he was shot dead.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a>MR ERWEE:	That is definitely not the case Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a>CHAIRMAN:	Were you really here to save his life?</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a>MR ERWEE:	Yes, definitely.  That is why I called the Medic because I could see this </p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a>man was very, very seriously injured and there was very little hope of his survival.  He </p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a>lost his consciousness the second or third time, I realised that ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a>CHAIRMAN:	Did you make arrangements that an ambulance be sent with equipment </p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a>from Alldays, maybe to meet the bakkie on the way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a>MR ERWEE:	No, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a>CHAIRMAN:	Well, shouldn't you have if you were concerned about his survival?</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a>MR ERWEE:	If I think about it today, yes, I suppose we should have got an </p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a>ambulance and met it half way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a>CHAIRMAN:	Why was the helicopter not called back to come and pick him up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a>MR ERWEE:	The helicopter had already left 15 - 20 minutes before, and most </p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a>probably close to Pietersburg already and that is why I decided not to recall it.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a>believed that it would be another 5 - 10 minutes before it would land at Pietersburg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a>CHAIRMAN:	Did that Medical corp drive in the bakkie with the injured person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a>MR ERWEE:	I can't remember whether he accompanied the vehicle, I can't </p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a>remember.  I didn't give him a specific instruction to go along.</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a>CHAIRMAN:	Do you really think that he did travel with the corpses, the Medical </p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a>officer, together with the injured person? I think you would be able to recollect that, </p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a>wouldn't you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a>MR ERWEE:	I can't give you a negative or a positive answer, I can't remember, it is </p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a>too long ago.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a>CHAIRMAN:	Did this bakkie have a canopy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a>MR ERWEE:	It did not have a canopy.  I can state that as a fact, because I loaded </p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a>the man onto the bakkie with help.</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a>CHAIRMAN:	So this badly injured person was being transported with some of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a>corpses in an open bakkie on a gravel road?</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a>MR ERWEE:	It was a gravel road.  Whether all the corpses were on this bakkie or </p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a>whether there was equipment, or whether one or two corpses, I can't recall.  All I can </p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a>recall is that I loaded him onto the bakkie and I supported him so that he would be </p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a>comfortable, because there was no other immediate transport available for us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a>CHAIRMAN:	Well, how did you make anybody in that condition comfortable in an </p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a>open bakkie on a gravel road?</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a>MR ERWEE:	I am assuming that he didn't lay directly onto the metal, that we put </p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a>down bags or some kind of covering to transport him, because I did lay him down on </p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a>something, but I can't remember whether it was a blanket or a bag or what.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a>CHAIRMAN:	Well, another question which I should ask you and I am not trying to </p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a>be funny, you said you planned to take him to Alldays Day Clinic?</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a>MR ERWEE:	I can't say whether there is a Clinic, I just said take the person to </p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a>Alldays because I was aware that there would be medical help there, I didn't know </p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a>whether it would be a hospital or a Clinic, but I knew some for of medical help would </p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a>be available in Alldays.</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a>CHAIRMAN:	Of what kind, if you didn't know if there was a hospital or a Day </p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a>Clinic, of what kind?  Medical help of what kind?</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a>MR ERWEE:	I expected there to have been a Doctor at least who would then further </p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a>stabilise the injured person and he could then perhaps be further evacuated to </p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a>Pietersburg, which have better facilities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a>CHAIRMAN:	You didn't have any particular Clinic in mind, you didn't have any </p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a>particular hospital in mind, you didn't have any particular Doctor in mind in Alldays, </p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a>did you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a>MR ERWEE:	No, I didn't have anybody specific in mind.  That is why I originally </p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a>said that the person to take this wounded person to Alldays would be members of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a>Security Branch whether from Louis Trichardt or Messina and not from Pietersburg, </p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a>because these people would be more familiar with the area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a>CHAIRMAN:	You said the purpose was to arrest these people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a>MR ERWEE:	That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a>CHAIRMAN:	And then do what with them after arresting them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a>MR ERWEE:	After the arrest, Colonel Strydom and Colonel Dreyer would have </p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a>dealt with the particular case dockets and they would have been charged with the </p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a>promotion of terrorism and promoting the aims of ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a>CHAIRMAN:	What about the cover of Sehlwana and your informer on the Botswana </p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a>border, would their cover not have been blown?</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a>MR ERWEE:	I believe that they would have been exposed to a certain extent.</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a>CHAIRMAN:	Didn't that worry you?  Were you prepared to accept that situation </p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a>that they could be arrested, taken to trial, possibly the cover of Mr Sehlwana and the </p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a>other informer be blown?  Were you prepared to go with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a>MR ERWEE:	That would contain calculated risks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a>CHAIRMAN:	Then why didn't you accept that risk with regard to the inquest?  Why </p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a>didn't you disclose the truth at the inquest if you are not scared of the cover being </p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a>blown because I thought one of the reasons why you said you misled the inquest, was </p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a>that you were afraid certain disclosure would be made?</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a>MR ERWEE:	That is correct.  I believed that after all six people died, it would not be </p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a>necessary that it in fact wouldn't influence the Presiding Officer at the inquest.</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a>CHAIRMAN:	Colonel, isn't it so that look Sehlwana transported this people, he runs </p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a>in a roadblock with them, then it is clear, it would have been clear to these people that </p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a>Sehlwana was in fact selling them out, wasn't that just a death warrant to these people, </p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a>silence them once and for all, no problem with the cover, blowing the cover of your </p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a>informers and your agents?</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a>	If they are silenced and all killed, there would be no problem about anything </p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a>being blown?</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a>MR ERWEE:	Let me put it this way, I am quite honest when I say this, it was </p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a>important for us to arrest these people and if we really believed that these insurgents </p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a>should be shot dead summarily, there surely would have been other easier ways of </p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a>doing it, ways which did not entail so much risk.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a>	For instance in this river bed which is quite wide, we could have shot them </p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a>dead there.  I could have requested the police's Special Task Team and the Defence </p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a>Force, we could have requested these teams to shoot the people dead.</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a>	At the time that we threw in the gas grenade, we could have also have thrown </p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a>in a bigger hand grenade or some other explosive device to just destroy all the people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a>CHAIRMAN:	Well, I am asking you this question Colonel because we have heard </p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a>similar evidence in other matters of  a light nature, in which we were told that virtually, </p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a>it may not apply in your case, but we have learnt that in instances where the identity of </p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a>an informer would be disclosed, once it would be discovered by somebody, detained </p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a>or arrested that so and so was in fact working with the police, that amounted to a </p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a>death warrant to that person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a>	And it troubles me that you should say that you misled the inquest because you </p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a>were concerned with the cover of some of your people, but then at the same time you </p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a>say that you wanted to arrest the deceased and then bring them to an open trial.</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a>MR ERWEE:	If I may answer that, I concede that there were calculated risks in </p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a>respect of Sehlwana and the informer and other people who operated along the border, </p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a>to expose them in case these insurgents were arrested. </p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a>	I believed that Brigadier Coetzee and Warrant Officer Van den Berg and </p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a>Sergeant Sehlwana would have consulted with the informers as to how they could to </p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a>some extent protect these people, because you would remember Mr Chairperson, that </p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a>there was even a press statement released that the seventh person had escaped and this </p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a>was done to protect Sehlwana and the agent.</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a>CHAIRMAN:	Thank you.  Mr Visser, did you want to put any more questions in </p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a>relation to the questions that had been asked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a>EXAMINATION BY ADV VISSER:	Only in regard to questions put this morning </p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a>Mr Chairman.  Please give the Committee an estimate of how far this place where the </p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a>incident took place, was from Pietersburg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a>MR ERWEE:	I would say approximately 150 - 180 kilometres.</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a>ADV VISSER:	And how far is that from Louis Trichardt?</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a>MR ERWEE:	I am not quite sure how far it is from Louis Trichardt, but I think 80 to </p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a>100 kilometres.</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a>ADV VISSER:	As far as you knew, was Alldays the closest place where medical aid </p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a>would be available?</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a>MR ERWEE:	Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a>ADV VISSER:	To a question put by Judge Ngoepe, you said that with hindsight you </p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a>should perhaps have arranged for an ambulance to come from Alldays to meet you </p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a>halfway with this wounded person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a>	If we talk about hindsight, then one could perhaps also say that you should </p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a>have taken an ambulance from Louis Trichardt or Pietersburg - what however was the </p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a>purpose with which you confronted these people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a>MR ERWEE:	Chairperson, yes, it was not customary for an insurgent to walk around </p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a>with his firearm openly exposed.  For that reason we believed that we would take them </p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a>by surprise and wouldn't really encounter significant opposition.</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a>	So, for that reason we didn't really arrange for ambulances and all that kind of </p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a>equipment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a>ADV VISSER:	You at all times believed that you would be able to perform a </p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a>successful arrest?</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a>MR ERWEE:	Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a>ADV VISSER:	Mr Erwee, we are speculating now, but the question has been put to </p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a>you and I think you have already answered, if your purpose was simply to kill these </p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a>insurgents, just to shoot them dead, would this place where you have erected the road </p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a>blockade, would that have been the proper place for it?  Would it have been the ideal </p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a>place for it or where do you think should it have been done?</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a>MR ERWEE:	I believe that if we simply wanted to execute this people so summarily, </p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a>we would have done so in the riverbed, when they crossed the border because it would </p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a>have been a lot easier to do so with a sharp shooter, there would have been fewer </p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a>risks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a>ADV VISSER:	Yes, you would have needed six shots and that would have been that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a>MR ERWEE:	That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a>ADV VISSER:	And if you really wanted to act in a sinister way, you could have just </p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a>buried the bodies in the river bed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a>MR ERWEE:	Correct yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a>CHAIRMAN:	Speculation Mr Visser.</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a>ADV VISSER:	We are busy ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a>CHAIRMAN:	And I could ask him whether that could still have looked like self </p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a>defence, could it?  If they had killed them and buried them there and hidden the bodies, </p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a>that could not have looked a bit like, it wouldn't have looked for a minute anything like </p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a>self defence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a>MR ERWEE:	Yes, of course not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a>CHAIRMAN:	It depends on what the plan is and it depends on what in the mind of </p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a>the person is and I don't think we really, well you can go on putting those questions to </p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a>him, but at the same time you - I don't know where we are getting to because </p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a>questions will be put to those speculations and then they just appear to be nothing else </p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a>but speculations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a>ADV VISSER:	Mr Chairman, the only reason why I am putting these questions is </p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a>because I thought these are the questions you put to him, I may have misunderstood </p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a>you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a>	But is really a question of argument in any event and if this end comes up, I </p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a>can cover it in argument, so I will leave that Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a>	One other aspect, the question which now arises is if they don't shoot and you </p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a>arrest them, what would be the outcome of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a>	You said that the would be processed and ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a>CHAIRMAN:	Sorry, can I interrupt you there, because I would like you to, as far as </p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a>possible, the last word though that is not necessarily the case, but the point you have </p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a>just asked him something, I think I must make a follow up on it about the question of </p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a>calling an ambulance and the like.</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a>	Was it not your evidence and you must tell me if I misunderstood you, was it </p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a>not part of your plan that the helicopter or a helicopter would be at hand in case some </p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a>of your people were injured, then it would lift them?  Was it not in the plan?</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a>MR ERWEE:	The reason why the helicopter was there, was to help with the </p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a>possibility of somebody escaping, the helicopter would have been able to follow the </p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a>tracks of the escaping person, so we could arrest him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a>CHAIRMAN:	... as to how to rush any of your people to hospital, should they be </p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a>injured?</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a>MR ERWEE:	No, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a>ADV VISSER:	Just to get back to the last question Mr Erwee, you mentioned the </p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a>possibility of the people to be put on trial and be prosecuted, there are also other </p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a>possibilities and that is that - well, perhaps you can tell us what these other possibilities </p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a>are.</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a>MR ERWEE:	If we arrest an insurgent and we receive good co-operation from him, </p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a>we would then try to get him to work with us, perhaps to be a witness for us.  It is not </p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a>a necessity to prosecute him or one and all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a>	Attempts would have been made to do other things.</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a>ADV VISSER:	Lastly Mr Erwee, you may have forgotten this because it has happened </p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a>11 years ago, but it is also so that at that stage, that is now the 10th of July, it wouldn't </p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a>have been possible or it wouldn't have been necessary to prosecute these people in a </p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a>court of law, because there was a general state of emergency in existence at the time </p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a>and you could have just have detained them, so it wouldn't have really been necessary </p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a>to reveal the identities of the informers or Sehlwana?</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a>MR ERWEE:	That is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a>ADV VISSER:	Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY ADV VISSER.</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a>CHAIRMAN:	Mr Visser, let's deal with that speculation.  We must because when I </p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a>asked the witness what did you want to do with them eventually, he didn't say I don't </p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a>know what we were going to do, there would be many possibilities, he didn't.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a>	He chose one direction and he said, we are going to arrest them and then </p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a>charge them.  Now, you are putting to him other possibilities and I think I must ask </p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a>him  in relation to that too, I mean you can't keep a person in detention for ever, could </p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a>you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a>	You couldn't have kept anybody in detention under emergency regulations for </p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a>ever, at some stage you would have to take him out of detention?</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a>MR ERWEE:	No, you can't keep him indefinitely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a>CHAIRMAN:	And if you wanted to, if you would have had in mind to use them as </p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a>your informers, what if they refused, what would you have done with them if they </p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a>refused to work for you?  What would you have done?</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a>MR ERWEE:	Obviously, we would have charged them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a>CHAIRMAN:	Yes.  What I am saying to you is that in the end, because you are </p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a>carrying out your lawful duties, you would have to follow the legal processes in order </p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a>to act lawfully, isn't it?  Any way, thank you Colonel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a>	Mr Rossouw, did you want to put questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a>MR ROSSOUW:	I have no questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a>NO CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR ROSSOUW.</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a>CHAIRMAN:	Mr Black, do you want to catch it by the tail?</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a>CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR BLACK:	There are just two little issues, I just </p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a>want to clarify.</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a>CHAIRMAN:	Yes, just don't repeat what we covered this morning in your absence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a>MR BLACK:	No, I just want to put it to you Mr Erwee, that when Brigadier </p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a>Coetzee testified, he said he received the information about the yellow shirt and the </p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a>meeting at the station from Captain, as he called him, Dreyer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a>	And you say you are the one, you conveyed this to Colonel Van der Merwe </p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a>and he conveyed that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a>MR ERWEE:	I heard the evidence of Brigadier Coetzee.  It is 11 years ago that it </p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a>was Captain Dreyer who transferred the message that the six insurgents had died, I </p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a>conveyed the message that five insurgents had died and that two people were </p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a>wounded.  One insurgent and one Defence Force member and that the insurgent had </p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a>died on the way to Alldays.</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a>MR BLACK:	Fine.  And the other issue just to, you say that you cannot recall </p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a>whether all the corpses were placed in the back of the bakkie when you loaded the </p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a>wounded man on the bakkie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a>	Now, I just want to put it to you that all the corpses must have been on that </p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a>bakkie, because as I understand your evidence, that was the only available transport </p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a>left other than the casspir and you cleared the scene of all the corpses and the whole </p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a>scene as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a>	So this wounded man must have been transported with all other five corpses?</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a>MR ERWEE:	It was 11 years ago, indeed, I can remember when I loaded the person </p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a>onto the vehicle, I made him comfortable.  There were some of the deceased on the </p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a>bakkie, but it is possible that some other vehicles came from Alldays to help, but I can't </p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a>remember that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a>MR BLACK:	And in fairness to you I must still say that according to my notes when </p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a>you testified yesterday, one of the reasons given by you for the use of the helicopter </p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a>was in case wounded people had to be transported and in the event of people also </p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a>being arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a>	That's just on record, thank you.  I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a>CHAIRMAN:	Mr Black, at some stage I thought that that is what he said and that is </p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a>why I put a question to him in that regard a few minutes ago, but is your recollection </p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a>that he in fact said so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a>MR BLACK:	Yes, according to my notes, that was one of the reasons for having the </p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a>helicopter, was in case they had to transport wounded people and also to assist in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a>event of people being arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR BLACK.</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a>CHAIRMAN:	Any way I suppose the record will show, because one of my </p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a>Committee members tells me that that is also her recollection.</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a>	Do you want to comment on that Colonel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a>MR ERWEE:	Yes.  The helicopter was primarily to be present in case one or two of </p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a>the insurgents tried to escape, but I concede that the helicopter could also have </p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a>assisted us if any other problem cropped up on the scene.</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a>	For instance somebody was injured, it could have been any kind of help.</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a>CHAIRMAN:	Well, in that case I would have thought that, precisely because you </p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a>open fire on the combi and before allowing the helicopter to leave with Captain Born </p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a>or was it Captain Born, before allowing the helicopter to leave the scene with Captain </p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a>Born and because you knew you had shot those people there, I would have thought </p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a>you would delay the helicopter to see whether there were any survivors.</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a>	Particularly if your intention was not to kill them, to see whether there was any </p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a>survivors there.  You must have been they would be injured at the very least.  And </p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a>then put them on the helicopter as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a>	Why was that not done?</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a>MR ERWEE:	That is correct.  You must remember that when I jumped out of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a>casspir after the seize fire, the teargas overwhelmed us and I ran away for about  80 to </p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a>100 paces.  When I could not longer smell the teargas, I could see the helicopter and </p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a>then Colonel Dreyer came running with Captain Born to the helicopter and then when </p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a>we got to the helicopter, I helped him load the injured person onto the plane.</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a>	Some of the teargas had already permeated our clothes and it was also hanging </p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a>in the area, and the helicopter had to take off very quickly because the flight engineer </p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a>told the pilot we have to be very quick, we will have trouble with the teargas </p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a>otherwise.</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a>	And then I went back to the combi and the casspir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a>CHAIRMAN:	But that is exactly my question Colonel.  Why was the helicopter not </p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a>delayed for a short while so that you could satisfy yourself whether there were people </p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a>in the combi who needed that kind of help?</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a>MR ERWEE:	Yes, that is so, but as I said there were teargas very close to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a>helicopter and in the helicopter, so it had to take off very quickly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a>CHAIRMAN:	So it is the teargas that is the important issue here, is that the reason </p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a>why only the Captain was evacuated and not also one of the injured persons?  So it is </p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a>the teargas that is the crucial thing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a>MR ERWEE:	Yes.  Yes, nobody could get close to the combi at that stage.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a>FURTHER EXAMINATION BY ADV VISSER:	Just a short question arising </p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a>from what you have just said.  When Born was loaded into the helicopter, did you at </p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a>that stage when the helicopter took off, determine whether any of your men were </p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a>injured who could also have been transported by helicopter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a>MR ERWEE:	No, I didn't do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a>ADV VISSER:	Thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a>NO FURTHER EXAMINATION BY ADV VISSER.</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a>MS KHAMPEPE:	Mr Erwee, I could be mistaken, but I seem to recollect that </p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a>your evidence was that it took approximately 10 minutes before Captain Born could </p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a>be loaded onto the helicopter.  Would my recollection be correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a>MR ERWEE:	It could have been that time, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a>MS KHAMPEPE:	So, if it took approximately 10 minutes, would it not have </p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a>been possible for you by that time to have ascertained if there were any injured people </p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a>inside the combi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a>MR ERWEE:	When I got to the helicopter, I stayed there, I didn't go.  They came to </p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a>me with Captain Born.  I didn't know beforehand where the chopper would land.</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a>	I also don't know who summoned the helicopter, I just heard that it was </p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a>already airborne.  It is only when they came running with Captain Born that I realised </p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a>that one of the Security men had been wounded and when we loaded him, the teargas </p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a>was already there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a>	Immediately after we loaded him, I went back to the bakkie and the casspir </p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a>because the teargas had at that stage, dispersed somewhat, it wasn't quite so bad.</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a>MS KHAMPEPE:	How long did it take for the teargas, the smell of the teargas to </p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a>become reduced to enable you to come to the minibus?</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a>MR ERWEE:	After the helicopter took off, I moved back to the combi.  And when I </p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a>got there, there were already members there, so I would say from the time that I fled </p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a>the teargas until the time we loaded Captain Born and I went back, it was </p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a>approximately 8 - 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a>CHAIRMAN:	Thank you Colonel, you are excused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a>MR ERWEE:	Mr Chairman, I would like to ask before I am excused, the question </p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a>now arises why am I here today.</p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a>	And I would like to say to the Commission that firstly I am making this </p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a>application for amnesty in the spirit of national unity and the promotion thereof, in </p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a>order to find peaceful solutions and also to promote reconciliation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a>	And also to move away from violent resistance politics in the future.  The </p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a>offences about which I have doubt whether I was competent or whether it was lawful, </p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a>are firstly that I believe that when we were shot at, I acted lawfully and that I had the </p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a>authority to fire back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a>	But, that I have doubt and I am in an ambivalent situation regarding the </p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a>question of whether I exceeded my bounds.  This doubt is based on the fact that Dr </p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a>De'Oliviera thought it necessary to investigate the matter and Archbishop Desmond </p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a>Tutu has said on many occasions, where you have any doubt, you should rather apply </p>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a>for amnesty in the spirit of reconciliation to put all the facts on the table.</p>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a>	The National Commissioner also thought it necessary to arrange a special </p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a>occasion in Pretoria to put it to us that if we should have any doubt, that we should </p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a>rather apply for amnesty in the spirit of national unity and reconciliation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a>	Further Chairperson, from experience I know that courts take days and weeks </p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a>to hear matters and it takes trial within a trial to determine whether we exceeded the </p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a>bounds at a shooting incident, for instance.  And as far as a possible charge of </p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a>obstructing the course of justice is concerned, I am very honest when I say to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a>Commission, that the handling of the inquest docket, I did not include all the  </p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a>(indistinct) of sequences in this docket, because I believed that that which I did include </p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a>in the docket, in the inquest docket, was sufficient to enable the Presiding Officer to </p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a>make a finding in this inquest.</p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a>	And if it should be found that I committed an obstruction of justice, I ask for </p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a>amnesty for that in the spirit of the promotion of national unity and reconciliation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a>ADV VISSER:	Thank you Mr Erwee. </p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a>ADV VISSER	1	A.J.G. ERWEE</p>
