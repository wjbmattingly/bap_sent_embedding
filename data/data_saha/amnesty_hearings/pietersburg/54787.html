<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>CHAIRMAN:  Today is 2 July 1997 and we are proceeding with the same matter of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a>Erwee et al.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a>WILLEM JOHANNES VAN DER MERWE:  (Still under oath).</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a>CHAIRMAN:  Mr Van der Merwe is being recalled at the request of Mr Visser.  Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a>Visser?</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a>FURTHER EXAMINATION BY ADV VISSER: Thank you, Mr Chairman. Mr Van </p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a>der Merwe, there is something which I forgot when you were testifying.   You told us </p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a>that after the events there was a Press conference or a Press statement was released, </p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a>regarding these events, and in this Press statement it was said that seven terrorists had </p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a>entered the country in the mini-bus and that one of them or that six had been killed and </p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a>that one had escaped.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a>MR VAN DER MERWE:  That is so, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a>ADV VISSER:  Could you say who was responsible for that Press statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a>MR VAN DER MERWE:  I made the statement to the then SABC. </p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a>ADV VISSER:  Yes, the facts are not entirely correct, because the seventh person </p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a>who escaped was not a so-called terrorist but a policeman namely Matthews </p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a>Sehlwana.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a>MR VAN DER MERWE:  That is entirely true, it was done in order to conceal the </p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a>true facts, namely that a policeman had been present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a>ADV VISSER:  And why would you have wanted to conceal that fact?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a>MR VAN DER MERWE:  To protect Sehlwana and to conceal his involvement in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a>matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a>ADV VISSER:  That is all the evidence in this regard.  It is fact that happened and I </p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a>thought you should be aware of it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a>CHAIRMAN:  Thank you, Mr Van der Merwe.</p>
