Mr ChairmanI just want to point out from the onset that I shall lead, indeedstart leading the evidence of Petros, but must also point outto the Committee that I have instructions to appear on behalfof five applicants.  For the purposes of the convenience of thedeliberations I have opted to lead the evidence of all the fiveapplicants that I am appearing on behalf of, and then later onlead the evidence of any further witnesses which we might deemnecessary.  The reason for this Mr Chairman is that the circumstancessurrounding the incidents relating to these applications are allto a great extent similar, and in that way we hope that we shallbe sparing a lot of time for the Commission.\n Before I continue I would just like to confirm Mr Roland, MrChairman I am led to believe that before I lead the evidence ofthe first applicant Roland Petros it would be necessary for himto take the oath.",

After a long period Tsietsiearrived together with his other friend whom I don't know.  I leftthem outside the house and I went to tell Tsediso that Tsietsieis here and he is with the other friend, I don't know.  I alsotold him about what I heard from this other girl before Tsietsiearrived.  I then went back to Tsietsie and when I got outsideTsietsie was alone and his friend was not there.  I asked himTsietsie where is your friend?  And he said he is visiting hisrelative.  I don't know where they are.  And then I went to comradeTsietsie and told him to get into the house.  I showed him toTsediso and Tsediso came to see him and then we sat down.  Andthen I left the house with Tsediso to go and talk to him.  Whilewe were still talking and telling him about what happened ComradeDaniel also arrived.  Comrade Daniel's spirit was high.  He lookedlike a person who was scared, and he said to me he saw the 3 millionkombi passing at my workplace and in the kombi I saw Tsietsie. I asked him Tsietsie and he said yes.  I then asked him further,are you sure of what you are saying and he said yes, I saw TsietsieI know him very well.  And then I said to him Tsietsie is in thehouse.  And he got shocked when he heard that.  And then I saidto them, what we have to do is to take Tsietsie to our comradesso that he can explain what is happening.  And then we took comradeTsietsie.

He said unacceptable words andI felt very regretful not to say these words, he said to me let'sgo to Paul's place and I asked him what are we going to do atPaul's place?    He said don't ask me many things because he hadthis terrible thing in his hand, a gun, and because at that timeI was scared of death I listened to his orders and we went anywherewhere he wanted us to go to.   When we approached Paul's area,the street in which Paul lived, it happened that he was far behindme, you know we were not walking close to each other, he was behindme.   I thought that this person he wanted to detain me becausehe took me by force, I must say he took me by force because Inever thought that he wanted me to go to Paul's place.  I washeading for my home to sleep.   Now according to his orders Idid what he ordered me to do, it's because he had a gun in hishand, I was not armed I did not have a stone in my hand, nothingand he slapped me on the, in that same street because he was veryclose to me.
