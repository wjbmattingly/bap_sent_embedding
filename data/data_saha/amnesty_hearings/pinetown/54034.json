            "Thank you.  Mr Chairperson, I want to begin by saying that insofar as the applicant is concerned there are indeed some problems and the problems do appear to be pitched at a level that there is a variance in the version presently adduced to that, adduced at the trial but I dare say if one dissects that difference it does not become so mammoth, so counter-productive, so self-defeating as to negate the application for amnesty.\n\tPrincipally there are three fundamental contradictions in his version between that at the trial without a record of course, looking at the record or the bundle as we have it.\n\tThe one is that he says \"we stabbed the deceased\".  He explained that when Mr Sibanyoni asked him the question that by \"we\" he meant the one Nsomi held the deceased was \"I stabbed him and because we both participated in this, I said we\" and I think that is a fair explanation.\n\tThe other contradiction that he has is he stabbed the deceased with his knife, meaning the deceased's knife as opposed to the applicant's knife.  Now there are three points to be made there.  The first is this, there is indeed a statement which the applicant testified - sorry, deposed to, it is the statement contained on pages 5 to 7 of the bundle, it is no doubt a statement that was made under oath and it is a statement in which he says:\n\t \"I had a knife in my possession.\"\nNow when I took instructions from him he said it should have read:\n\"I had no knife in my possession.\"\nHis evidence makes it very clear that he did not have, that means the applicant did not have a knife in his possession.  The applicant makes it very clear, crisply clear, that he took this knife from the deceased and that having used the deceased's knife he stabbed the deceased to death.  Now what turns on this?  If he had a knife of his own, premeditation would probably be the argument.  If he had a knife of his own it exacerbates his problem.  If he had dispossessed the deceased of his knife it's supports his contention of self-defence.  Now to support the contention that there must be some truth in the fact that he must have dispossessed the deceased of his knife, one looks at the earlier versions contained on pages 24 of the bundle - sorry, 24 and 25 of the bundle.  When this applicant, then the accused number two, appears before a magistrate unrepresented, unaided by any person, even though unaided whilst the police were allegedly assaulted him, being present in court, he says words as crisply and clear as:\n\"I stabbed the deceased with his knife\"\nand later in the middle of that page says:\n\"I admit that I stabbed the deceased with his own knife.\"\nSo support for the contention that there is a level of veracity in that version more than in the version that the knife of the applicant was used is to be found in the unaided version of the applicant when he was unrepresented as early as when he appeared at court on the 22nd January 1992.\n\tMr Chairperson, that being the two contradictions, there is the third and that is where he says on these pages 24 and 25:\n\"We chased the deceased\".\nNow that contradiction I concede is one that he did not explain at best.  His explanation there is not very satisfactory.  In fact he says or rather he responded in response to Mr Sibanyoni's question about this by saying\n\"I did not say that, that is an error, it was recorded incorrectly.\"\nThere appears to be a ring of truth about his explanation.  Now when one ties that explanation with the fact that he was unrepresented with the fact that he had just made a statement to the police which talks about five persons as opposed to about six or seven, to a policeman who allegedly assaulted him and a policeman who is now present in court and who as an accused then is speaking through an interpreter to a magistrate who now records the matter, there is the possibility of a level of confusion, is intrinsically present, it cannot be argued that it may not be possible that this was an error.\n\tThose are the only three contradictions of merit.  There is nothing else that the applicant has made.  Generally the applicant was forthright in his testimony, he spoke with candour, in a manner that showed that he was being as honest as he could.\n\tNow one must look at the applicant's testimony against the background of what truly is the position today.  This is an applicant who has been convicted of this murder, this is an applicant who has been to jail on the sentence, has served his full sentence, appears before this Committee in the pursuance of an application for amnesty.  In truth, in effect, no purpose would be served on this applicant's lay life if the application for amnesty were granted or refused.  If it were refused ...(intervention)",

All I want to suggest is this, if there is testimony uncontroverted from the applicant that there were some problems in regard to this statement, why for example my knife, the deceased's knife, he says \"I never said that.\"  He says he didn't read the statement before he signed it.  When asked pertinently about that aspect as to whether you turned around he says\n\"I never turned around, I never chased the deceased, I fell.  I dispossessed him, I wanted to subdue him\"\nAnd that's the level at which he pitched version.  No amount of cross-examination defeated him on that.  It's only the statements, which he, the applicant, also casts doubt on which stands against him.\n\tMr Chairperson, there is this aspect that you've asked us to consider and address you on, namely whether there is an offence.  I have just a few submissions to make on that.  Basically two.  The first is this, the applicant no doubt has been convicted.  I accept that this is not a court of appeal.  He is endeavouring in the hope of if he gets amnesty granted to have his slate cleaned.  That's the most positive effect he can achieve from this process.\n\tBut secondly, not his view but my view as a lawyer looking at his version, if one looks clinically at his approach of self-defence, it seems to me it is not one that really succeeds as self-defence for here is a man, who on his own admission, is in the company of Nsomi who holds down the deceased at a time when the appellant - sorry, when the applicant dispossesses the deceased of his knife.  Now at the level of arguing his activity hadn't gone beyond the bounds of self-defence one can see clearly that if he dispossessed of the knife he could well have taken that knife and run away.  He needn't have stabbed the deceased, he needn't have stabbed him to such an extent that three stab wounds were inflicted which indeed common cause caused the death of the deceased.  At that level of exceeding the bounds of self-defence it is murder with the firearm but yes, that was negated by the time the applicant got to him.",

            "Indeed, yes.  Mr Chairperson, apart from that we have the brother of the deceased and Alzina, the common-law wife or girlfriend of the deceased to have testified.  I deal firstly with the brother of the deceased.  I submit respectfully that his testimony is not one that can be accepted.  His testimony is pitted with contradictions of material value.  He is one who had, for want of a better term, to gain effect, to show that the applicant was really a criminal, pitched his entire version on the basis that this was a criminal act but yet in contradiction concedes the correctness of his wife's statement about the political motivation being present, that these persons being IFP and ANC being correct.\n\tNow on the probabilities, Mr Chairperson, you raised one important aspect with this witness.  If his father celebrated on the New Year's Eve, to have been so under the stupor as not to have known that the applicant - sorry that the deceased had spoken or not, then surely if the witness had celebrated as indeed he must have, then he also would have been as confused as he would have us believe his father was but he did not respond to say he did not celebrate, he evaded the question.  The probabilities favour the conclusion that he must have celebrated the night before for it was a New Year's Eve night, that if his father was in fact under a drunken stupor as to be confused then surely he must have.  But the probabilities are part, the contradictions are so apparent, I mean he talks firstly about:\n\"my father having reached the spot of the deceased on the ground\"\nsorry, on the sports ground,\n\"well after I reached there so my father cannot tell that the deceased spoke or not\"\nand this in explanation of the term used by the father in his written statement that - sorry, if I may just get to that - on page 14 of the bundle, where in the second last paragraph the father says:\n\"he was unable to speak\".\nWhen this aspect is put to him and he is asked about:\n\"What do you mean by your father was confused or celebrated the night before?  If he arrived later you see then you need to explain that?\"\nHe says:\n\"Well, my father and I did arrive there together\"\nreverting to his first version which he had used in response to Mr Sibanyoni,\n\"And that because we arrived together\"\nhe then adduces the explanation that:\n\"Oh well, my father could not have heard me speaking to the deceased because he celebrated the night before and was confused.\"\nNow when this is again dealt with he alters it marginally and indeed pads that version to distance himself from it endeavouring to explain it again and again.  All those four contradictions were put to him, he could not explain it properly.  \n\tHe then talks about three stab wounds not being possible, he pitches it at a level of being more than six stab wounds.  He says so evident were the stab wounds that the lungs were showing.  Now if one ties his version with Alzina's version, which I must submit at this stage is the more believable of the two.  By the two I mean between the brother-in-law Frederick and Alzina.  Then Alzina's version is that the deceased has a stab wound right here in the larynx and it must obviously follow that speech would have been debilitated to such an extent as to render the version of Frederick that he has this ongoing full version and discussion with the deceased implausible to say the least.\n\tNow to tie that together than more than six stab wounds as against the entire documents before us, speaking of three stab wounds, unfortunately we don't have the post-mortem report etc., but it would appear as though in the formulation of this record having regard to the court record, one stuck to three stab wounds and that might have been common cause in the trial.  Now to say more than six stab wounds is really pitching it at the worst.\n\tHe then talks about the child.  No doubt he must be mistaken about the age but he talks firstly about the child being four years now.  When Mr de Jager questions him how could it be possible that the child could be four when this murder took place in 1992 he says he doesn't know because he has not seen this child for a long time, the child lives on the farm if I recall what he said.  Mr de Jager then correctly tells him well, that if the death occurred in 1992 then the child must be 10 now.  He easily concedes yes, that's possible.  Now if he is that intelligent man he wants us to believe him to be, then surely he must know the difference between four years and ten years, even at the level of a mistake.  My submission is that he was simply trying to distance himself from the reality to show a child very young to buy sympathy and shows that he was not sticking to the truth generally.",

In fact the child has been visiting his home and he has been visiting the child, he is the elder brother in the family.  In the nature of things, that must be the more believable version.  That is as true as Frederick's version is untrue about his having not seen the child for many years.  He says \"I don't associate with the child, the child since the death of my brother has gone back to the farm, I've not seen the child.\"  So at that level I say that there is a ring of untruth in his version and therefore that reason must be unbelievable, his version must not be acceptable.\n\tBut then there is another contradiction.  He says he last met the deceased and Alzina - sorry, may I just look at my notes, bear with me?  Yes, he said he last met the deceased and Alzina on the morning of the 1st January and when questioned about this he distances himself from that and says \"no, no, I did not meet them, this was a report made to me by the children\".  Now Mr Chairperson, against the background of this I submit that Frederick was a man who was simply stretching the elastic to it's limit in his desire to gain effect.  His version must be rejected.  Alzina on the other hand I concede immediately is a believable witness.  She comes in here and she says it with so much of candour and truth that even I could not cross-examine her to break her at any level.  There are, despite that, contradictions between her written statement and herself.  Indeed the contradiction relating to the three stab wounds as opposed to one stab wound and the contradiction between \"the body having been loaded into Mbambo's vehicles at the time I got there\" as opposed to \"having already being loaded in there when first I got to Mbambo\" are versions that can be argued away on the basis that no doubt she made a statement as is common cause as is evident on the statement on the day of the death so she must have been at level disturbed.",

What motive would the applicant have to come here and lie?  What motive would the applicant have to come here and lie?  He's served his time, he knows that if he comes here and says that on the basis as most ANC or politically motivated applicants before TRC are doing, \"listen I went there, I had an agenda, I had instructions, I executed my instruction and I did it coldly, I had no difficulty with that\", the probabilities of him getting amnesty would be all the better?  Now I have canvassed that with him, he's again and again said to me \"listen, it was self-defence\".  It seemed to me that the deceased on the applicant's version had not chased him, the applicant and the applicant did not respond by stabbing him, it would have been inevitable and conceivable that at some future foreseeable event, the ANC, through the applicant would have executed an agenda to eliminate this deceased and but for this event it just became earlier.",

If you look at Alzina's application she agrees when Mr Mapoma asked the question, that yes, the applicant and his members were ANC members, that is in my statement and I said so, they lived in an ANC area and indeed that was so.  My boyfriend the deceased was in an IFP area, he comes from an IFP area and that's principally the reason for the fight.  Frederick goes further, he says I agree with my wife, it's an ANC/IFP conflict, it's politically motivated.  Now political leanage is established even on the witnesses for the victims.  Full disclosure is the problem and there I have no argument.   Sorry, if you'd bear with me?\n\tThe only one reservation that I have with Alzina's version is that appears to distance herself today until Mr Mapoma raises a statement with the ANC leanage and the IFP leanage.  It seems if at all - I'm sorry, I'm not sure that I can submit this but it seems to me personally that knowing that this is an amnesty application there is a need for political leanage that she distances herself from it.  I do not know what happened at the trial but I'm told by the applicant that she punctuated her entire evidence on the basis that he, the applicant, then an accused, was an ANC man, that the deceased was an IFP man, that this was ongoing conflict between the ANC and the IFP.  That is the only reservation that I have and Mr Chairperson, with those submissions I submit that if one reads within section 20(i) of the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act 34 of 1995, at the level of there being an act or omission or offence without reading too much into the need to establish whether there is an offence here, perhaps looking at whether it's an act in itself, the applicant has made out a case for amnesty, he does have difficulties with Alzina's version looked at against him but there has been many matters of this sort with difficulties for the TRC.  That in itself, like a trial, does not dismiss his application as negatory.  Thank you.",

            "Sorry Mr Chairperson, just wondering a bit.  What motive does the applicant have to launch his application for amnesty?  That answer is quite simple, Mr Chairperson.  It's my respectful submission that when this application was launched for amnesty, if one looks at page 3 of the bundle of documents, one would note that this application was commissioned on the 1st November 1996.  Now at that time the applicant would have still been serving his sentence.  In his attempt to launch his application it would have given the will to foresee that he may be out of prison sooner than expected and more importantly had he most probably stuck to this application itself as opposed to submitting Exhibit B, he would have had almost no problem in most probably succeeding his application.\n\tThe Committee sits here today and has to make a decision as to whether (i) was the act or acts of the applicant political?  And (ii) has he fully disclosed as to what had taken place on the day?  He has expressly stated under his evidence in chief and cross-examination that he acted in self-defence.  He has also in paragraph 11 of his statement submitted on the 14th of this month stated that his act was self-defence.  Now the Committee now faces a problem in deciding whether we need to grant him amnesty for this application.  As the Committee you are faced with an issue of a political agenda.  Now the applicant has abandoned his political agenda and has brought to the Committee's front that this action was one of self-defence and his most fateful submission that this is not the forum to have raised this issue.\n\tMy learned friend has argued that one can look at Section 20 and consider the acts, offences, in it's wide sense to embrace this argument.  My learned friend has further argued that ...(intervention)",

If you get what is obviously a political fight between an ANC group and an IFP group who are seeking to take over a building or something and it is in furtherance of their objective, but during the course of that fight one of them gets cornered and he manages to take the knife away from the person who has cornered him and stabs him so he can get away safely.

Now the applicant seems to now distance himself from the political objective.  He mentions that he did not have the intention to kill the person and thereafter goes on to say it was self-defence.  He merely had to stick to his version that the killing of the victim was as a result of the original act that was political?",

            "Mr Chairperson, I may concede that point that it can still be very well construed as political.  \tNow the second test of this application is that there has to be full disclosure.  Now as my learned friend has pointed out, he cannot submit or make any submissions with regards to full disclosure.  The full disclosure of the applicant is hampered seriously by the evidence of Alzina.  Even if one has to disregard or not hold the evidence of the brother Frederick Mbukazi in much light, it is my respectful submission that Alzina was straightforward, she was candid, she was able to give a detailed account and a precise account of what took place.  She was not able to have been broken under cross-examination and she merely related what took place on the day in question.  Now if one has to look at the version of the applicant who suggests that she was there to just merely see the people punished, a person of that sort, Mr Chairperson, would not have been able to sustain a detailed cross-examination.  She gave her evidence straightforwardly, she had no problems in relating the sequence of events that took place.  She detailed the place where they were at as well as the incident and as to how the body got to the hospital.\n\tNow the applicant would like us to believe that the incident took place at the ANC stronghold, that being Dangani and she quite emphatically denied that.  She states that they were on the way to the market and this took place near the power school, that is in the Hlangesi area and that is where the incident took place where the applicant attacked, together with two other, attacked the victim.\n\tThe applicant further denies there being a person namely Mbambo, Kwazi Mbambo.  Now judging from the evidence delivered by Alzina she was very sure as to who was present.  She gave a detailed account, there were three people.  So and so gave the knife to the applicant and he did the stabbing.  Shows the person that did not add frills and thrills, if she did not know something she blatantly denied it, \"I do not know, I can't say for sure\" and that was it.\n\tNow even if one accepts this entire in the mind of the applicant there was a political feud going on, everyone accepts he is an ANC activist, he is an ANC supporter, everyone has to accept that the victim was an IFP supporter or IFP activist, that will cover the political aspect of this application. \n\tThe second issue to address is the full disclosure.  It is my respectful submission that the applicant has not made any full disclosure or has not made full disclosure.  It is common cause that the victim was killed but the circumstances under which the victim was killed and as to why exactly he was killed, that in my respectful submission is not full disclosure and it is therefore my respectful submission that the applicant has failed the test to be countered amnesty and accordingly his application should be refused.
