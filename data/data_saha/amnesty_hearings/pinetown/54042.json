I also made a statement about the victims who had died, ANC victims as well as people whose houses were burnt down.  On the 19th of November 1998 a Commissioner from the Reparations Committee, came to me.  He had forms which they could fill, that is for the people whose statements had been approved by the TRC.  I then made arrangements for those people  to converge at Hibberdene to fill those forms.  That is what has happened with regards to the people on this list.  Unfortunately I sent messages to IFP victims, but I got no response, but I have heard since that some people did go to fill out the forms.  Likewise with ANC victims, those people who did not turn up to fill in the forms and I was informed that they were intimidated by the Chief who warned them not to involve themselves with me or the TRC, so those people have been unable to fill in those reparation forms.

May I just mention that, as can be seen from the crowd at the back, contained in that crowd are a number of persons who are potential witnesses who would support this applicant's testimony but lest the contrary deduction be drawn, given the nature of the cross-examination and the discussion I've had with my learned colleague who represents the victims, there seems little point in me calling those witnesses.  For the reasons of expediency, I'd rather not.  Thank you.",
