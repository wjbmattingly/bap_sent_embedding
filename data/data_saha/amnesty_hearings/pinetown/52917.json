Thompson himself was present.\n\tWe went to kwaMashu, we were headed for kwaMashu.  On that particular day, I did not get inside, except Thompson and Innocent went inside and quickly returned and told me that he was not in the house.\n\tThe following day, when we went there for the second time, on a Sunday, Thompson said we should go back again and we agreed that we will go his place of work, that is where we will wait for him.  Monday morning truly we went there, because he was working at Tisha Centre, that is where he was working, and we arrived in the morning before he arrived.\n\tWe waited for him there, until he arrived.  Thompson told him that there is a person who wanted to see him.  I have forgotten as to what name he mentioned, but we knew that he was fooling him about that.  There was no person in other words there to see him, so that he could come along with us.  That was just a trick.\n\tNdlandhla performed some delaying tactics to an extent that he even said and admitted that he had a meeting with the management of Juba Breweries.  He informed us to that effect and he left, he went his way and we went our way.  We parted.\n\tIn the afternoon, we went to his house then, and I got inside myself and Innocent as well.  We found his brother inside and his wife.  That is Ndlandhla's brother's wife and the wife was expectant.\n\tInnocent knew the family quite well, the Meheza family.  It was their first time to see me, but they knew Innocent very well, because it looks like Innocent once stayed with them.\n\tAfter we said that we were looking for Ndlandhla, they told us that he just stepped out, he will be back and they started chatting generally with Christopher's brother, that is Ndlandhla's brother and Innocent.\n\tAs they were still conversing, Ndlandhla came in and then Innocent knew very well that these are Christians, in other words that family was a Christian family, they believed in praying and we prayed suddenly and Ndlandhla came in and he was wearing a white T-shirt and it was raining outside and he got inside the bedroom and put on a jacket.\n\tHe came and joined us for prayer, we knelt down.  Ndlandhla was the last one who prayed.  He prayed for a long time and immediately after that, we were telling them we were leaving and Ndlandhla accompanied us.    We took him, we told him to get inside the car and we now argued as to where he shall sit.\n\tHe didn't want to sit right in the middle of us, he wanted to sit by the door, but we insisted that he should sit right in the middle, and we took a certain route, the N2.  Just before we got, it was about 1.5 km before we reached the toll gate towards kwaZulu, on the N2, we parked there.  We pulled off and we got into the sugar cane plantation.  That is when Thompson asked him as to who was he working with.\n\tHe cried suddenly and said no, I am not working with anyone.  There was some evidence that Thompson had ...",

It was a bar where they will usually go for their drinks.\n\tThe problem we had was transport.  We did not have a car or vehicle to use to get there to accomplish, to further the mission.\n\tSebata was a Commander at that time.  He came up with a plan that we should by all means necessary get a car.  In other words, we will have to disguise, we agreed amongst ourselves that we will go to Durban and hire a taxi and pretend as people or as students of UNITRA, coming from UNITRA visiting here in Durban, visiting UDW, the University of Durban Westville.\n\tIndeed we went to that taxi.  Sebata was the one who was our spokesman, he spoke to the taxi driver and said to the taxi driver we are the students from Transkei, visiting the University of Durban Westville and now we will like to go back to UDW.  How much will you charge us for that distance and the driver said I will charge you R40-00.  Sebata took out some cash and we got inside the taxi.\n\tThe one was sitting in front, in front of the steering wheel was Sipho, to drive the vehicle.  Right next to or behind the driver was myself, and right next to myself in the centre was Sebata.\n\tThe extreme left, on my extreme left was Kushukushu.  We were four in number.\n\tWe got inside that taxi and the taxi left.  We took of from Point in Durban, headed towards Westville until we got to a turn off of Westville, from the freeway.  I think it was roughly about 350 to 500 metres, before we reached the security gate of Durban Westville, the University that is.\n\tSebata told me that I should be the one who will approach the driver.  The reason was the driver was a Zulu speaking person and Sebata was not conversant in Zulu, he was a Xhosa.\n\tNow, Sebata wanted me to convey the message to the driver as we were speaking in the same language.  That was the reason and Sebata gave me a gun as he was telling me that message as well.  So, he told me that I will scare the driver off by this gun.  I approached the driver and said we are soldiers of APLA and we will like to get your vehicle to go and conduct our mission,  we will bring your car back.\n\tHe resisted.  The driver that is, and at that time, the car was no longer in order driving straight, it was going side by side.  He could not control the car, and the gun had already been cocked and I was not aware of that fact.

That time when he mentioned that name, I already had heard that Ndlandhla is working for this particular Police by the name of Piet.\n\tNow that quickly registered in my mind, now I heard him say Piet, I am suppose to give you a feedback, but I will see you later when I come back from - meaning from the meeting that was scheduled with the management of Juba Breweries.  In other words he was saying he would talk to Piet after that meeting, when he gets back to the office.\n\tI was asking myself, wondering as to what feedback was he referring to or what feedback is he talking about here.  You see, we know a few English terms and the names, English names, now when this Piet was mentioned, in my mind there was nothing else except that this is the Piet he is working with and yet the congress we had the previous day, Ndlandhla was there, he had attended, and the day when we were killing him, we asked him about the phone call and asked him who was this person you wanted to give a feedback, and he accepted and told us that it was Piet Nel, and this was the Police that had hired him.\n\tBesides that incident, I will say you see an informer can be identified very easy and so simple.  An informer is so curious, will always want to know every detail, even things that will not concern him at all.  That is the characteristic of an informer.\n\tBut then again, when you listen to him quite closely, you will follow that the information that he so much wants to know and hear, it is not because he has any interest in what you have, but you can tell easily that he has other motives, or hidden agendas.",

It would not have served any purpose, because they would have also themselves been injured or killed in the process.  The car could have capsized and all of them died and they would not use the car for the purpose they wanted it for.\n\tWhy would they just shoot the driver intentionally.  Mr Chairperson, it is my submission that the Committee should accept that the applicant did not shoot the deceased deliberately, but it was a mistake.  What they wanted was the car.\n\tThe car was to be used for a specific purpose and they wanted to use it in a mission in Port Edward, which of course was a political motive, they wanted to go and kill the people who were there, which already, they had already identified as the target.\n\tAs such the killing of this innocent person, the driver, was in the process, he was a victim in the circumstances, but he was not the main target.

He doesn't check it, he doesn't know whether it is loaded or not, but in the whole circumstances, it might be a reasonable conclusion to arrive at that he acted so grossly negligently or recklessly, that it could have been a form of dolus eventualis and even murder, as opposed to - it is a possibility.\n\tSo although he says he didn't have the direct intention to kill him, the fact that he was handling this highly dangerous weapon in a situation which was very dynamic, to say the least, because the driver got a fright, he said the car got out of control, yet still he is holding this gun to the man's head, it goes off.

That is precisely the reason why I don't even want to touch the robbery, because his evidence is very clear that they wanted transport.\n\tI accede that, but my problem was based on this issue of recklessness and Mr Kanyile not having been even in their mind, that he might be killed, but to be threatened.  Perhaps if we push it a little bit further on the threat, and we try to cover or attempt to cover threat as may possibly mean, murder, then I will still have a problem.\n\tA threat remains a threat, it cannot be taken to the extent of saying a threat means killing, taking the life of a person.

Mr Chairperson, the argument is that the reason why it was by mistake, the applicant has put before this Committee that if we shot him in a moving car, we would not have achieved our purpose, because we wanted the car.  We would have been injured, also ourselves.\n\tHence the accidental shooting.  What we wanted was the car.  If we shot him, the car would have been damaged also.
