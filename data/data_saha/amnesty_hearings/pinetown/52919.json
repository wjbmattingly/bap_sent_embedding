            "After the death of one of our comrades who was shot by the kwaZulu Police at kwaMakutha, this comrade was removed from a taxi.  After that incident, we did not know how the Police had found him, because he was on the run from the Police because of certain crimes.\n\tDuring that time, a rumour circulated that the person who had contacted the Police was Mr Ndlandhla Msani as a person who worked at kwaMakutha, we knew Ndlandhla Msani.\n\tAfter learning that he was the one who had contacted the Police, we wanted to question him about that incident.  During those days, Ndlandhla Msani was not seen around, he was not around in the area.  Some time elapsed - amongst the comrades, what we knew was that he was the one who had contacted the Police and we were expecting that whenever we saw him, we would stop and question him.\n\tOne day I had been with some of the comrades at the township, we were at Mkhize house, house number 10, it was in the afternoon.  On that day I went home because it was getting dark.  I took a jacket from home and I returned and as I approached, I saw the comrades discussing something.  They were saying that Ndlandhla Msani was approaching.\n\tThis was the first time we saw him after the incident of killing Mduduzi.  We thought that if he saw us as a group, he may be afraid, that is if he was responsible, because we also were not sure if he had indeed contacted the Police.\n\tTherefore we planned that only one person should approach him, and stop him on the street because he knew us and if he saw only one person approaching him, he may not suspect anything.  We deliberated on who should approach him because he had just passed us, but we knew that he was going to return the same way where we were standing.\n\tI volunteered to be the one to stop him.  There was a problem of how I would handle him if for instance he started fighting with me, and I said when he stops, they should also start approaching and I would explain this to him, that we wanted to speak to him as comrades.\n\tI was a bit afraid because I was young, I was 19 at the time.  I then requested from amongst the comrades that if a person, if anybody has a weapon, they should give it to me so that if maybe we argue or we fight Ndlandhla, I could threaten him with a knife or with a weapon.\n\tAlthough I cannot remember who produced the knife, but somebody produced it and I took that knife and I went on to the street.\n\tNdlandhla approached and I stopped him.  He did not stop directly in front of me, but he stopped at about the sixth house from where we were.  I then ran to him.  I thought that if I explained the situation to him, if standing from outside, he may suspect something or he may resist, because although we were not sure that he was indeed guilty, but if I had told him the entire story whilst I was outside the vehicle, he might actually run away.\n\tI then asked him to take me to the depot and he agreed.  I got into the vehicle, it was himself and his conductor in the car.",

            "We believed that it could be that he did in fact contact the Police because in most cases, taxi drivers in the area, were close to the kwaZulu Police, so there was that belief that he may have done it.\n\tThereafter I got into the car and I told him, I asked him to reverse, because the comrades wanted to speak to him.  He hesitated because he indicated that he wanted to move forward.  I tried to reassure him that he shouldn't be afraid, because we just wanted to question him because of a certain problem.  \n\tHe asked what the problem was about and I told him that we have heard rumours that he was the one who had contacted the Police with regards to Matobela's death.  When I told him this, he tried to move the car forward and the car did move and I tried to stop him, by grabbing the steering wheel.  He fought me off because he was bigger than me.\n\tWhen he hit me, I also felt it.  I took out the knife and I stabbed him twice at the time.  The car was all over the road.  Some of the comrades realised that there was a problem in the car, and they came and got into the car, and they told him that they want to speak to him, because of the rumour that had been circulating.\n\tHe seemed to be listening.  We told him to get the car into another street, which was the second street from the main road.  He seemed to be loosing consciousness at that time, and some of the comrades pushed him aside.\n\tI got off and I went to sit behind the steering wheel.  I drove the vehicle and as I turned the corner, getting into another street just below, he opened the door and tried to run away.  As he opened the door, I stabbed him again and he ran away.\n\tThe people sitting behind, I think at the time the conductor was no longer there.  The comrades that had been left on the street, would meet us at an appointed point.  As Ndlandhla got off the car, I was the first one to alight, because apparently the sliding door at the back had a problem.\n\tHe ran to a nearby house and he fell as he arrived at this house.  I met up with him there and I stabbed him again because at the time, it appeared to me that he seemed to know about the issue.\n\tWhen I first got onto the car, he tried to move the car, also start the car when I told him about the problem, and I realised that he must know about it.  If he did not know about it, if he did not have a problem, he would not have tried to run away if he was innocent.\n\tAfter stabbing him, I left him there and I went back and I met up with some of the comrades and they asked me where he was, and I explained to them that he was at that particular house.\n\tOn our way back, we discussed that if he hadn't run away or after questioning him, we would have killed him anyway because during that time, we had problems regarding the kwaZulu Police and IFP killing our comrades.\n\tTherefore nobody else but ourselves, had to protect our organisation and our members.  The kwaZulu Police worked hand in hand with the IFP.  When the other comrades arrived, we discussed that the car was parked on a hidden road, we should take it back to a street above, that it towards the rank, so that the others could see it.\n\tWe left the car there with the keys inside and we left.  Thereafter our parents and the ANC leader in the area, who was not present during those days because he was sought after by the Police, he would sometimes come and sometimes he would leave, he would just come to attend meetings or maybe if there had been an incident, he would arrive.\n\tThereafter ...",

After that, our parents together with Eden Mongathi who was not present when this incident occurred, and who had not known about it, they were surprised, they were shocked that this taxi man had been killed.\n\tOther taxi people arrived and they removed the car.  After this incident, we fled and we went out separate ways because we knew that the kwaZulu Police would come and they would not arrest, but shoot us.  \n\tWith regards to the community, it was shocked.  A meeting had to be called where an explanation should be given to the community.  I did not attend that meeting.  I was mainly sent as the person who had killed Ndlandhla and people did not know why.\n\tAt that meeting the community of Ward 1 received an explanation from other comrades with regards to the reasons for Ndlandhla's death, that is we had discovered that he was the one that had contacted the Police about the movements of Nduduzi.\n\tThe Police had stopped the car that he was travelling in and he was removed from the car, and shot.  The community understood, but after that there was a problem, that is taxi's stopped running for about two weeks.\n\tThe taxi's did not run in the kwaMakutha area and the community complained about this.  That is why that meeting was called and Ndlandhla's death was explained to the community.\n\tAfter that, taxi drivers complained and they said that they would avenge themselves.  After a few days, about three or four days, some people who were armed arrived at kwaMakutha and shot at comrades.  The comrades that I remember to have died on that day were three or four.\n\tThey said that they were revenging.
