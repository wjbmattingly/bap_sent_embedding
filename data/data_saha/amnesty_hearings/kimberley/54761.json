            "(cont)\n\tMr Chairman, before we start with or before I proceed with cross-examination, I would like to address two specific issues which were raised earlier.  The first concerned the trial of the people involved and the question right at the start of the proceedings, as to the submission of the evidence that Mr Smiles acknowledged at that stage, that he had thrown the hand grenade.  \n\tIt was unclear precisely what happened during the proceedings.  In the meantime Advocate Mpshe has said that he has made available to the Committee, an extract from the record dealing with that particular day and specifically the evidence by Mr Mtlele.  During his cross-examination, Advocate Potgieter put the specific affidavit dated the 27th of September to him.  Now that was apparently put to him on - a few after the drafting of that affidavit on the 2nd of October.  The State then said ...[intervention]",

            "PROF DE KOKER",
            "Advocate Potgieter put the affidavit to Mr Mtlele and that is on page 181 of the record at paragraph numbered 30.  The state then intervened and said that would be hearsay evidence unless the particular witness which was Mr Smiles was called, they then asked Mr Potgieter whether he was going to call the witness.\n\tMr Potgieter then said he was unsure - it proceeded - he was unsure whether he was going to call the witness.  They then argued for another 10 pages which brings us to page 189 and page 190 of the record.  I see that the record is handed to the Committee members only now.  Excuse me Mr Chairman, I proceeded on the basis that you had them in front of you already.  \n\tI'm referring you to page 181 at the bottom because that is where the discussion starts and then it proceeds to page 189 but with a bit of history on page 190.  In the middle of paragraph 10, Mr Botha placing the following on record:\n\"Pardon your Honour, I want to place on record that directly after the negotiations and when we adjourned, I told my learned friend - this reference is to Advocate Potgieter, that we were not going to use him Mr Smiles, as a witness.  When he got to the police station in the presence of his advocate, it was told to him that the State was not interested in him and that he was regarded as a witness for the defence\"\nSo at that stage it was clear that he should have been called by the defence.  On page 189, Advocate Potgieter refers at paragraph 10, to the date on which this affidavit was drawn - paragraph 10:\n\"When did he make this statement Mr Potgieter? - recently, just a few days ago the 27th, what are we today, the 29th\"\nand then he said the 2nd which meant the 2nd of October.  Mr Potgieter continues:\n\"Monday yes, I don't know what his status would be.  I can hear them saying that I can get him again but I don't know\"\nThe court says:\n\"Pardon\"\nAnd then they continue and Mr Potgieter says in the next paragraph:\n\"Yes, I  understand what my learned friend is saying, we can get hold of him again\"\nA bit further down, 25:\n\"Mr Potgieter, I understand that he's now available to me\"\nMr Chairman, that clearly shows - and if you can proceed to page 191, it is repeated and then on page 191, paragraph 30, Mr Potgieter closes by saying:\n\"I want to propose it but I want to say I'm not in a position to say whether this person is a witness of mine\"\nPage 192:\n\"I must assure myself because I can't make a statement to this witness and then he turns out not to be a witness, I don't know whether I can do this.  I know that I can prove that the statement was made\"\n\tIt seems therefore from this extract from the record, as if it was clear at that stage that the onus was on the defence to call Mr Smiles as a witness and they also allowed him to proceed with Mr Mtlele's cross-examination, putting aside the affidavit but allowing him the opportunity to return to Mr Mtlele at a later stage once the specific evidence has been led.  I just wanted to put this to the Committee to clarify the matter as discussed on Monday morning.  \n\tThe second preliminary matter deals with the document referred to by Advocate Tsholanku of which he was kind enough to furnish us with a copy.  I look at page 71 which is the paragraph which he specifically quoted in connection with the command initiative.  I follow his rather sensitive argument but it seems to be connected directly to the appendix which only lists incidents ranging from 1960 to 1989, fairly detailed and a fairly lengthy appendix.  I would like to find out and I don't know whether Advocate Mpshe will be able to help us.  \n\tThere is a rather abrupt end to this list in 1989, was there a further document by the ANC or any document or submission to the TRC directly submitted by the ANC, in which they accepted responsibility for this particular incident.  That is not clear to me, it's clear - and that was raised yesterday, it's not listed in this list but there seems as if there could be another list or a further submission.  I would appreciate it if this matter could be clarified.\n\tIt is clear that this is not the kind of incident which could simply have slipped away as being unknown by the ANC because it was reported to their legal department and some matters were actually dealt with by the legal advisor, Mr Matthews Phosa himself.",

You can't just in the middle of the evidence, while you are cross-examining the witness just stop leading evidence and just start arguing certain aspects of the case in the middle of a hearing.\n\tWe really find this to be causing us great difficulty.  If you have got points to argue, to raise and even you feel you want to criticise some the reports and the like, do that at the right stage.  We're busy talking about certain things which are matters of argument and the witness is in the meantime sitting in the witness box.  The witness is there for you to put questions to him - we lead evidence, finish the evidence and then argue the case later.",

That which is there is a general statement, it does not say - well, it does not deal particularly with my injuries, that is actually a very general way of saying I was injured.\n\tWhat I have experienced is, I spent some time in the ICU, I suffered balance problems and because of that I had to learn to walk again, I had to learn to speak again.  I spent seven months - the rest of 1993, at my parents home to recuperate and I returned to Bloemfontein in 1994.  I wasn't able to work again until 1995.  I lost use of the left part of my body, full uses of which I have not regained and which I probably will never regain.  \n\tI had a number of operations, some of which included reconstructive surgery.  I still have a shunt in my brain which regulates the pressure in my brain because the fact that there's shrapnel in my brain blocking parts of my brain, so I need pipes in my body to make my brain and the pressure function properly.  I suffer severe pain every day of my life, I can't sleep at night because the nerve ends in my brain were affected to such an extent that it's painful to rest my head against the pillow.  \t\n\tI can't go back to the work I'd done prior to the accident, I had to make a complete career change and even where I work now, it's a struggle.
