Just very shortly, I do not want to go into a long story, but at that stage the approach of Mr Mpshe was that basically only the two applicants are what is necessary, but the background here is two people have been convicted and a whole number of witnesses may shed light on what you are supposed to investigate in this matter.\n\tI am just wondering, Mr Chairman, well, from that point of view, Justice Mall ordered that a further pre-trial conference had to be held under the Chairmanship of one of the members of the Amnesty Committee and that has not been held and I am just wondering whether it may not be an idea if one of the two gentlemen presiding today would be prepared to assist us in having a short pre-trial conference.

            "Thank you, Mr Chairman.  Mr Chairman, before we commence, I just want to put certain things on record.  Inasfar as victims are concerned, the victims are present, though not all of them, but they are aware, they are seated right in front here.  Mr Chairman, in the last hearing wherein this matter was postponed, that was on the 25th of August 97, the postponement was due to, amongst others, the following reasons and I am going to tell the Committee as to what has happened in the meantime.  There was a victim, a Mr Cassandra, who was deployed to South Africa by the United Nations to act in the peace mission.  Mr Cassandra was not before the Committee then in August and Prof Louis de Koker who is here in, with us indicated that Cassandra would like to attend the hearings and, at that moment, Mr Cassandra was not in South Africa, but he was in Angola.  The matter was postponed in order to secure his presence.\n\tWhat has happened so far, Mr Chairman, is that I got in touch with the Angola Mission in Pretoria about the whereabouts of Mr Cassandra, especially when I was arranging this particular hearing days, and when I phoned the office in Pretoria that very same morning I was told that he was around in Pretoria and I immediately issued a fax to him and made him aware of the hearing days and wanted him to confirm.  He did not come back to me, but later on a person at the Angola Mission in Pretoria contacted me that he did receive the fax, but, unfortunately, he has left for Angola once more and this person, a Mr Joseph, informed me that all my correspondence has been forwarded to the United Nations, because it is them who must decide whether Mr Cassandra should attend or not.  I have a fax from him to that effect, if the Committee would like to see that fax.\n\tThen later I wrote him a letter again to find out what is the position now and he told me that he was still awaiting the response from the United National Legal Department.  On the 20th of this month the gentleman in charge of the Mission in Pretoria telephoned me and told me that he has now a response from the United Nations about Mr Cassandra.  One, to sum it up, he read a document to me and he said he cannot forward the document to me, because it is for them and it is confidential from the United Nations, but the effect thereof is to the effect that Mr Cassandra is not allowed to attend this type of a hearing by the United Nations Legal Department.  Number two, that if there is any information that we want from Mr Cassandra, we must put that in the form of questions to him, to Mr Cassandra, but via the United Nations, but he will not attend.  \n\tNumber two, yes, that is all, and this I conveyed it back to him to confirm or telephonic conversation I have a fax to that effect and I requested him to telephone Prof de Koker and make him aware of the contents of the letter as he was the person who had made mention of Mr Cassandra and made, actually made the Committee aware of his whereabouts.  That was done, that was confirmed to me by Mr, by Prof de Koker that the information was also conveyed to him.  Now, that closes the chapter in as far as Mr Cassandra is concerned.\n\tAnother reason why the matter was postponed was that Prof Louis de Koker stated to the Committee that Walter Smiles, one of the applicants, had in 1993, if my memory is my good servant, made a statement and this statement was given to the now Premier of Mpumalanga, Mr Mathews Phosa, and he, Prof de Koker, has been in contact with Mr Mathews Phosa for that statement, but he has been unsuccessful.  He did make available to me all the correspondence between him and Mr Mathews Phosa and the Committee requested that I must look into the matter and see if I cannot get the information from Mr Mathews Phosa.  I did so, I contacted the Premier, Mr Mathews Phosa, and I spoke to him telephonically and he promised to respond to me in writing, which thing he did.  He faxed a letter, a copy of which I do have if the Committee would like to see, and in the letter, the contents, it is simply that, indeed, it is true.  The applicant, Mr Walter Smiles, did make a statement indicating that he was the person responsible for the throwing of the hand grenade and Mr Phosa then, representing the ANC Legal Department, contacted General van der Merwe about this and General van der Merwe referred him to talk to General le Roux and Mr Mathews then got in touch with General le Roux on the matter and he gave the statement over to the, but he was told that what he is saying and what Walter Smiles is saying is not correct, he is not the person who threw the hand grenade.  The people who have thrown the hand grenade are the people the police have arrested.  So, the matter was thrown out like that.  I did communicate that ... (intervention).",

Shortly after the commencement of the trial, Adv Potgieter approached the prosecuting state advocates with a copy of an affidavit, signed by Walter Smiles, in which he accepted full responsibility for the explosion.  On the strength of the affidavit, Adv Potgieter wanted the State to stop the prosecution against his clients which would have resulted in their immediate acquittal.\"\nThe last paragraph reads as follows:\n\"After considering the affidavit, the State advocates came to the conclusion that it was a fabrication to secure the acquittal of the two accused.  I agreed with them and it was decided to proceed with the case.  It was pointed out to Adv Potgieter that he was entitled to call Smiles as a defence witness to prove his client's innocence.  In court, however, Adv Potgieter attempted to introduce the statement without calling Smiles as a witness.\n\t\tThis was improper and disallowed by the Judge.  Adv Potgieter never called Smiles as a witness and simply left the matter at that.\"\nThe point here, that seems to appear from this, is that the Attorney-General's staff, at least, on the strength of the affidavit, decided that it was a fabrication.  So, it seems, from that point of view, that it must be of vital importance to your Committee, Mr Chairman.  I just wanted to draw your attention to that.",

I was only instructed to argue on his behalf in August, so I have no instructions now, but I would like the Committee to consider his predicament.

            "It all started whilst I was still around in Kimberley.  It was in 1983, 84, if I recall, actually, quite well. I was actually amongst those students that one would define, at that stage, really, not so involved, because of the political system by then you were really worried that being a member of the structures by then to us, simply meant within no time whatever gathering that we will conduct, tomorrow for you was jail.  So, one was really concerned and scared at that time, until an incident did occur.  My mother, actually, can pay a witness and some of my neighbours on the street.\n\tWe were playing as kids in front of our home with some of the friends that I had.  By then they called it, actually, a Caspar, it is, actually, now a Buffel.  There were soldiers inside that Buffel who came, actually, passing by and it immediately, actually, halted in front of us.  Because of the nature of the vehicle, which was very, that we were not comfortable with, we, actually, flee out of the scene.  The soldiers, actually, did actually chase us.  I happened not to have ran, actually, into our home, because for me it was not safe.  It was only my mother there.  I continued, actually, to jump the fences to the following street.  \n\tUnfortunately, it happened that I should be caught and was picked up by the soldiers into a Caspar.  My mother, actually, came running towards that Caspar.  It was about 93, 94, because she wanted to find out exactly what have I done.  As, they, actually, responded in turn by saying I was part of a group who, actually, has lifted up a fist, by then symbolising Amandla and I was part of those, when the Caspar came, apparently, insulted them and that was a blue lie.  My mother tried to talk to me, they told her they are not prepared even to listen to her further, they drove away  with me.  There is a place in Kimberley, as they used the Barkley Road, Barkley West Road. It is, actually, popularly known as the Langboom.  Those are the tall trees.\n\tThey, actually, took me up to there where, actually, I was severely tortured by them and some of the words which were uttered to me, it was very clear that I must know it as from now on that my grandfather was a kaffir, my pas is 'n kaffir en ek gaan dood gaan en vrek as 'n kaffir.  That I should know, because they are not prepared to come and listen to me, any nonsense further than that point.  I tried to plead.  It is repeated that I might not recall that soldier inside there, elderly by age, because I was not conversant with the rank system at that, but the young ones were in part of that Buffel.  I could read from their eyes they were very pathetic and sympathetic, because they were young.\n\tWhat they actually did, they put the two Buffels together.  My hands, actually, they had to pull into the other Buffel and the other one into the other Buffel and they started, actually, slapping me in my face.  That slapping continued until, I think, the senior one came, started kicking at me, especially on my ankles.  I was thrown down that Buffel on the ground where the very senior one came and pressed, actually, his leg, actually, right on top of my head.  It was a sandy area, I was alone in that area.  Up until at the time I was coughing blood.  \n\tOne situation, actually, did occur that I would say did actually save me from them, because I never knew what they were going to do.  I think it was one of the schools from that distance where we went, we could see, actually, the smoke rising up.  I was, actually, left there with my trousers torn apart.  They left me there, ran into the Buffels and they drove off.  I regard that one, actually, as my point, where all my anger regarding the system started at.  It was after that fear, my mother, actually, took a decision, in 1995, fearing that, actually, I might end up being politically involved also, actually took me to Namibia to a school popularly known as Jakob Marengu.  \n\tUnfortunately, the school that they took me to happened to have been constituted by students who came from South Africa with different political backgrounds.  At that school, it is where, actually, one became more conversant, politically, regarding to certain issues.  I became involved in the youth league of Swapo by then that was internally based and a number of community related activities where there was a community based club.  The stuff, actually, was more based on acting and it was called, if I recall it well, Club 1000.  During my involvement at that stage, my links coming closer with the youth league of Swapo, as a member of Numsa also, that is the student organisation, literature, actually, became to our exposure, because we knew exactly if I wanted any political literature, where one of the members, who happen not to be here today, I learnt it later that he has passed away, he is originally from Upington and that is Tulani.  I might not recall his surname.\n\tWe had a way of obtaining any political literature that we want and I remember the first one that came into my possession was the one of our present President now, The Long Walk to Freedom.  The second thing that, actually, I became familiar with, was also Radio Freedom.  So, at that stage with my involvement with Swapo it led up until 1996 where, at that stage, the intensification of, one would defy the South African Police in terms of disrupting Swapo marches.  They were starting to intensify and I had a friend of mine, who happen not to be here, who, politically, at that stage, was more mature and stronger than I am.  We, actually, took a decision at that stage that, I think, it was the right moment for us that we should, actually, skip the country now.",

Then coming back in 1998, it was at the era when the agreement was reached, was, actually, reached, that is between South Africa.  The Namibian Government through the United Nation that ANC soldiers and the Cubans will have to withdraw from Angola.  I happened to have been part of those, that is the first contingent, we left Angola for Uganda.  That was in May 1988, 89 and reached Uganda, stayed there in the camps and assumed different political portfolios.  I am not sure do I have to state that.\n\tIn the camp, actually, as members of those who have trained and experience from Angola, I became a member of the Commissariat Department, I became a member of the Research Department, which was basically there to update lectures, to update political discussions around the camp, as an element which was sustaining us in the camp, because politics was one of the major areas.  I became a Company Commissar that trained personnel which came from Angola, I was deployed in it, shifted over now to the newly trained recruits who came in 1991, because it was for the first time that we had four ladies.  So, I was, actually, dispatched to that unit as a Company Commissar by the camp administration to handle that situation.  \n\tUp until October where I was, actually, deployed now in the Chief Representative's Office, working as an Education Officer.  At that stage my portfolio was to ensure, because all this members of MK in Uganda working through the Chief Education Officer of Uganda at a ministerial level, that we should ensure that we find openings for them, that is within all the tertiaries that are available there, including bursaries, that was linked with the World University Service, the South African Extension Unit.  That we did proceed up until the end of 1991, the 14th.  I have, actually, lost my brother and it was arranged, through the Representative's Office where a ticket was, actually, sent over from the military as to, that I will have to come back home.\n\tSo, I reached South Africa on the 14th of 1991, December.  I could not attend the funeral of the deceased, because I was late due to some arrangements in Uganda, but  now as the breadwinner by then, appeared to be the breadwinner, because my brother was the elder one.  The arrangement was made again with Shell House, I should, sorry that I should indicate the name, that happened at, comrade Chris was also still alive that time, where I went, actually, back to them and explained that my position of going back to Uganda, it is not possible, because I am the only elder one at home and my brother was the breadwinner. The agreement, actually, was reached then, because the application had to be done through the internal affairs, because I was only given 30 days to be in South Africa, that I will have to remain.  It is at that stage, actually, that my ID document was applied for.  So, I stayed in South Africa up until 1992, July where, finally, I was appointed as the Regional Commander of Umkhonto we Sizwe in the Northern Cape.  I assumed office up until 1994, that is June, when I was appointed as a Major in the National Defence Force, going through the (...indistinct) process, that is the British Military Aid Training Advising Team and at that stage I am serving at the three, the Third South African Infantry Battalion, that is in Three Sai, where I am appointed now as a Company Commander.",

It was during the process of the march, because the concentration and the spirit of the march was towards the destiny of the Trust Bank building where the Bop Consulate was.  The concentration of the people were there, they could not notice and exactly realise what I was doing at that time.  Smiles was just next to me and we were part of the marchers.  It was at that time when I told Smiles and those were my instructions, that as soon as we reach the Trust Bank building, after the last memorandum has been submitted and the marchers moving away, you must throw that hand grenade right into that sliding door.  That was my instructions to Smiles.\n\tWe proceeded with the march.  I parted with him, I went to the forefront up until we reached this Trust Bank building.  I remember during the last memorandum there was an exchange of words that were coming up from the marchers at that stage and we were still standing in front.  One of the comrades, who were senior in the march, came in front, calmed them down, they must calm down, because they were preparing to move away.  It was at that time when Smiles threw the grenade, but just at the verge of the door, I might not know his name, he is a security officer, but it is a private company, came out of the door and he was struck by that grenade right in his face.  \n\tThe grenade, actually, fell off right into the corner, where I should say today, it is where the deceased, Ezekiel Mokone was standing and it exploded from there.  The whole situation was very pathetic and a very chaotic one after the explosion.  Members of Cosas and the League became victims of that blast including their leadership.  When the explosion took off, everybody was running all over the direction.  We ran back to the office and I came back with the Bakkie.  The victims, we took them immediately over to Kimberley Hospital and at that time Smiles, I think, was still at the ANC office, if I am not sure.  \n\tThe reason why it became chaotic is that the situation turned out not as planned and expected mainly because of the grenade, actually, strike the security guard in the face and it went back where the deceased was standing, of which that was not intention and it resulted in the death of the deceased, Ezekiel Mokone.",

We had an operation called Operation Barcelona spearheaded, actually, by the league and at that time, as one commanding, actually, in the Northern Cape, I was commanding in the Northern Cape, actually, focusing on all areas of the Northern Cape.  To me, at my level, it became very clear that there is a situation that is starting to build up and, unfortunately, that is being (...indistinct) so fast, but when we proceeded at that stage, it appeared that the intensification was around the right-wingers, of which, when you go to Kuruman, it is about 27km away, they one, actually, one of their largest training camps.\n\tTheir training camp there was, it was more on a weekly basis.  The intimidation, assaulting of people, was becoming a very common thing (...indistinct) as the Vaal, Haaswaterbel, the situation was becoming very serious and for me, at that stage, I could not come up with a clear distinction, because I regarded the right-wingers, especially from the statements that we are (...indistinct), that they have a very strong force and support within the security forces of the country.  That situation did not end up there.  One, actually, became more sensitised when one learnt of the Polo Park incidences, when one learnt, actually, about the death of comrade Chris also, that was in April.  It became very clear that this situation is not, actually, going out as one, as one was, actually told, or expected that it should have gone.\n\tFor me, at that stage, preparations started to occur in the Northern Cape. Preparations were engaged mainly to prepare for the eventuality which might rise and it is unfortunate.  I have a very limited strength of members, that is those who were trained. When I refer to a trained MK (...indistinct) I am referring to those who are coming from outside and with that limited number, one had to try and centralise the whole approach, decentralise it, in the sense that we had to reopen up structures all over the Northern Cape and those structures stretched from all areas, that is Kimberley, Upington, De Aar, Posman, Petrusville, you go into Warrington, you go into the Bop Belt, where you have the (...indistinct), you have the Gomotso's, because that was the basis that it is important that one will have prepare himself now, because of these activities that are becoming very visible to us and among which of the civil war aspect was becoming very serious.",

It is not likely to believe his explanation that he did not know that it was going to be launched at the venue.

Based on the information given, the two inmates ...\",\nthat is Mbakwe and Engochla,\n\"... must be described as victims of gross human rights violations.\"\nNow, that is the way this whole application fits together, because what we have here is two convicted persons serving a jail sentence and two others coming to the fore to say those people never committed any wrong, we are the ones that did so.  That, Mr Chairman, is, in plain words, not due to a mistake made by the police or by the Attorney-General or by the judicial system, but on purpose.  That is the point that is made.  At the time when these witnesses gave evidence before the Committee for Gross Violations of Human Rights, there was an outcry, because of certain findings that were made at the time and it is in your record.  We might be allowed, later, to refer you to them, which elicited quite a reaction from the Attorney-General of the Northern Cape, Mr du Plessis.  I read one letter to you a little while ago.\n\tThe point here, Mr Chairman, this witness may not, specifically, say anything about the police, but the next witness, Smiles, will definitely have things to say about what the police did when he went to present his statement, Mr Chairman, and all of this you must read against the evidence that was given by Ngqele before the Gross Violation Committee by Mr Smiles, by Mr, that the police intimidated people, they did not want to listen to reason, there is even evidence of threats, of assaults and killing.  That is the background, Mr Chairman.\n\tNow, if I do not cross-examine Mr Mbatha and Mr Smiles walks into the witness box and he implicates, directly, the people for whom I appear, then I am going to have to call Mr Mbatha back, because I have to build up some sort of platform upon which I have to cross-examine Mr Smiles when this issue arises.",

We can be of assistance there to point out these discrepancies to you.\n\tFor example, just to mention an example.  At the trial of this case, Mr Chairman, Mr Engochla, the person who is really the one who Mr Smiles wants to take the place of, who threw the hand grenade, he pointed, he made a pointing out to the police where he said he stood when he threw the hand grenade.  He made a confession during the pointing out that he, in fact, threw the hand grenade.  Issues like that, Mr Chairman.  The statement which you have just been handed by Mr Smiles which was handed to the Prosecutors, I do not know whether you had sight of it, which bears virtually no resemblance at all to what his statements to the Gross Violations of Human Rights Committee was going, had been.\n\tThe point here, Mr Chairman, is that, certainly, my clients do have an interest that the truth be seen to be investigated and be seen to come out.  They also have an interest in not being thought of as persons who might make themselves guilty of thwarting the Law.  Mr Chairman, with respect, we believe and we submit to you that we have a right to cross-examine Mr Mbatha and we ask you for a ruling.  If you say we do not have such a right then, Mr Chairman, perhaps you should make that this can be tested.  The point is that we seem to be running into this kind of problem every time we arrive, most of the times, when we arrive at this Committee in order to show somebodies innocence.  It seems to be that when it is an applicant in an amnesty application who confesses his guilt, it seems to us that the Act and the procedures are geared towards that end, but it does not seem to us that the Act is really geared to accommodate a person who comes and want to tell you that he is innocent of allegations that are made, whereby he is either implicated or in which he has an interest.  So, with respect, Mr Chairman, that is all I have to say.  May I just ask my attorney?  \n\tYes, Mr Chairman, just by way of, by way, lastly, by way of example, if one takes too strict a view of an implicated person then the question arises what about Adv Jean Nel, she is not an implicated person, she merely has an interest.  The same with the late Chris Hani's wife.  She never had an interest, she was not implicated, she only had an interest.  So ... (intervention).",

            "Mr Visser, I think we should indicate to you that we are very reluctant to allow ourselves to get entangled in the whole question as to whether or not certain people were wrongly convicted.  That is the problem for the Supreme Court, I do not know there is in Kimberley or Bloemfontein.  I have already mentioned that we have come to know that papers have been filed and I am sure there is going to be an argument about whether or not that conviction of those people should be set aside or not and I am sure one of the people you have mentioned, Mr Nele, has filed papers and I am sure there is going to be a huge, possibly, there is going to be a huge dispute of fact and those people who filed affidavits in support of that application are going to be called upon to come and testify and the like.\n\tNow, we do not want to take that problem, which is not ours, and bring it into our arena and find ourselves involved in an argument here as to whether or not the conviction of those people was good or bad.  Those who want to support the conviction of those people must go to the Supreme Court concerned, file affidavits and, or go and lead evidence there.  Those who say that conviction or those convictions are bad must file papers with that court and go and give their evidence there.  We are going to be very reluctant to allow ourselves to take that problem, which is not ours, and bring it here and find ourselves sitting here having to decide whether or not the conviction of those people is good or bad.  That is not our problem and we will try by all means possible not to get ourselves entangled in problems which are not ours.  \t\n\tNow, to the question of, the point that you have raised now, it is not really a new point, because, Mr Visser, surely it is so that every person in this country wants the truth to come out.  Everybody in this country is interested in the truth coming out.  One cannot, on that basis, simply because somebody is interested in having the full truth told and say, well, that gives the person the basis on which that person can participate in the proceedings.  It must still boil down to a particular individual.  That particular individual must still show that him, I am talking about people with interest, they must still show that they have got interest in the proceedings and this simply takes us back to the same argument which was raised before lunch time.  \n\tI do not think we have, anybody has got a problem about the fact that your clients are interested in having the truth told.  Indeed, everyone in this hall is interested in having the truth told, but does that give them, bring them within the ambit of that section?  No.  They must, as individuals, still show the basis on which they will be entitled to participate to the extent of cross-examining witnesses and I am not so sure whether the argument is any different that, than when we broke up for lunch.  \n\tIn the meantime though, Mr Visser, well, you have suggested that we should make a ruling.  It crosses my mind that, perhaps, if we are to make a ruling with regard to Mr Mbatha, perhaps it would be better not to do so now.  It might be better to wait until your colleagues representing the victims have cross-examined.  It may be that from their cross-examination it may emerge that your clients have got some legal basis to cross-examine the witness.  It may be that during their cross-examination they may elicit some evidence which may tend to establish your client's interests one way or another and I thought, maybe, we should shelve that point and then let the other people put questions and only thereafter, your client's position, viz a vie this particular witness can only be properly assessed.  After all, simply speaking, the witness has not finished testifying.",

The other thing is, Mr Chairman, is, perhaps, I did not explain it properly enough or clearly enough, is that the interest which I was talking about is the interest of my clients in not being thought of as people who are not upholding the Law and who may be charged for defeating the ends of justice.

You know, you have not really said anything.  By just saying an abnormal situation was building up, that is really not useful evidence.  You should tell us what it is that, abnormal in which way, you should really get, be practical and fewer (...indistinct) less, come down onto the level, onto the ground and really be concrete and give evidence.\n\tIt does not help us to engage in high, in a high flown language and we really want evidence, you know.

You say, if you recall well, I did make mention of the Pollo Park incident, I did make mention that around the area, the military base of the very same structure that I have mentioned, that is the AWB, their training has been intensifying and my distinction regarding that force and the security forces it was, there was no difference, because they were clearly, actually, stating their support that they had.  Thirdly, Sir, at that very same stage, the disappearance of weapons from military bases was clear evidence that that thing could not be done without the involvement of people within inside.\n\tThat was the time when that whole process was escalating.  That is the situation that I referred to, was building up and had abnormalities and the repression, again, within the Bop situation, Bophuthatswana.  So, a person like myself, with a military background, experiencing all those problems, because it is very clear, when you talk in terms of arms are disappearing, you are not talking of arms to be stored, they will be utilised somewhere.  Whether when, it is what one, actually, should strive to search and try and find, but, unfortunately, as I have said, at the end of the day, the capacity, the understanding, it is at that stage, with your own initiative, when you read the situation that you start preparing yourselves for it.  \n\tIt was not long ago, on the very same area in Kuruman, a house was located, I personally had to go down, it was full of arms.  We never, actually, could conclude exactly, because we had to go through the maid who linked us up to the area and later, three days later that maid was chased away, out of that house.  So, the areas of the weapons disappearing from the military bases, like I have indicated, the actions that took place nationally at that time, yes, it is true, the situation was, we adhered, the organisation adhered to the Peace Secretariat, but activities on the ground clearly showed that the parties that you referred to as opponents that time, were not prisoners to those agreements and it has become very evident to us, this Commission, when people testified, because of those fears that one had, that this was the intention, this was the applied, this was the head political motivation, because they ended up, lately, acting out of those things, conducting blasts.\n\tThis is how, by then, the situation that I regarded was building up and my perception, actually, was linked out of those conditions.

I remember responding to a report, I am not sure was it read, but I do not recall it was Popo, because I responded, because there was chaos around the area and the unfortunate members were implicated in the matter and the whole presentation of the matter was brought in the sense that as if the three members instructed me and I just executed their instruction and I made it very clear that was not true.",
