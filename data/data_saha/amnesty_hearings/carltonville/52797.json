After now getting the information from the girl, Rebecca Silogilwe, we didn't take that information for granted because to us and other comrades in the section it was a new thing to us to know that this criminal gang did have a place not around the township and to my concern it counts that maybe that place is a hiding place for them because most of the time after they committed the crime and even though the crime was reported to the police, they are not being fined for their responsibilities.\n\tSo all of us as the comrades of Block 7 did go further with this information we received from the girl, Rebecca Silogilwe.  As it was late at night on the night of the 7th, we agreed by saying that we will have to meet tomorrow morning to discuss furthermore about the information we received from the girl, Rebecca Silogilwe. \n\tWhat happened on Sunday the 8th ...[intervention]",

He was trying to explain to those who were not with us yesterday, and he was further explaining our efforts to find those who were responsible on the night of the attack.\n\tAs he was giving, following the information we received from Rebecca Silogilwe, that they might have gone to Bekkersdal where they own a shack at the X section, as now the matter was put on discussion, all the comrades who were there were giving their side, their point of view as to the information and their support as to how we will find those who were responsible for the attack.\t\n\tAfter an agreement which was reached that we must find a way to go and trace that hiding place of those who were responsible for the attacks which happened at our section, it's when were discussing the route to Bekkersdal, so as there was no other way which you can get to Bekkersdal except the fact that we must find transport to can go there with the transport, I myself and my co-accused and comrade, Gustaf Morupisi agreed to go and negotiate for transport that can take us to where the deceased and other members of the gang can be.\n\tSo we went there to the taxi rank and on arrival at the taxi rank we introduced ourselves to the drivers and the those drivers did know, we did know them and they did know us because they were both staying at the very same section where we were staying.  We tried to explain everything that had happened the night before about one of our comrades and to arm, and to some attacks which were committed by the very same criminal gang.\n\tThey agreed to take us to Bekkersdal only if we can help them by maybe filling up the petrol tanks.

There is a section they call Up-town, at Bekkersdal.  It is where the van Rooyens have a relative there.  So arriving there both kombis parked outside the yard and then myself, the van Rooyen brothers, we get into the house.  The family members were there.  Even myself I was a familiar friend there, they did know me.  Steven van Rooyen was the one who tried to explain to the house what brings us to Bekkersdal in the early hours of the morning.\n\tFrom then on we divided ourselves into two groups as there were comrades who did know the section of the X's just like Steven van Rooyen as my co-accused.  From the yard, from the relative's family of Mr van Rooyen the other comrades travelled along to go and start searching where the X sections end.  \n\tSo we together with comrade Steven van Rooyen were going to start at the Up-front where the X sections were, where the X sections start.  We proceeded along the houses up until the first street of the X sections.  We go on that way asking from the residents, trying to give them their names, the names of the criminal gang members, their nicknames, trying to search whether they have any knowledge of the people we are looking for.  \tWe found that no-one had any knowledge of where they can be.  \n\tAs we entered the second street of the X sections of the shacks, proceeding that way, asking from one person to anther about maybe knowing, maybe if they did know or if they did see some of the people, but there was nothing, there was no-one who did know about them. \n\tAs we were still proceeding that way, it was likely that the perpetrators or the gang members did realise us from far away because as we were proceeding to our surprise we found that there was a group of people trying to flee, starting to flee from the last street of the section and we were moving in the second street of the X sections.  \n\tAs they spread up by jumping the fences and by going out of that shack, we tried to locate that shack by following those who were running away from that shack.  The two deceased, as the last street of that shack was facing the open veld leading to the Cook Two Mine(?) - as they say, there is a camp of a mine far away from where the zozos, from the last street of the X section, I together with my fellow comrades, Steve and Hendrik, we followed the deceased as they were running from the yard to the open veld of the, to the open veld where the whole thing happened after we reached them to that spot of the mine campers.\n\tWe followed them from their shack.  We tried - as comrade Steve was moving in front of me, we tried to talk to them to stop, we are not fighting with them but they proceeded.  As the mission was to go and catch them or to catch them to find them, we followed them up until the campers of the mine.  \n\tThere was a fence which was covering the premises of the mine.  They did jump that fence into the campus of the mine.  We followed them the very same way and we get ...[indistinct], there was a main gate far from where they have jumped that fence, we get along with that gate and now there was no way for them to can run away again because now we were in the premises of the mine and there was nowhere where they could go.  \n\tAs they took - as they stand, I took it to mind that maybe they give up or they have no way now to can go.  Comrade Steve as he was in the forefront, he was the one who was trying to talk to Mr KK Nxaku while I was still on my way to where Steve was trying to talk with them. \n\tAs Steve was trying to get closer to Mr KK Nxaku, Mr KK Nxaku drew the gun and I screamed to Steve: \"Steve, be alert, the guy is having a gun in his hand\".  He tried to shoot but the gun refused to shoot, and it is when we pick up the stones and we throw them with the stones.  He tried to run away, he tried to shoot again but the gun never, no shot went off from the gun and we managed to grab him now.  \n\tSteve managed to hit him with a brick on the head, and as he fell down our aim was to grab him.  The gun was far away from where he fell down.  I kicked the gun as he was trying to grab the gun again.  I kicked it to that grass and it's when we started to kick him, when he was struggling to stand up.  He managed again to stand up and he pulled out the jungle knife and it was when we started to hit him with the stones.  We hit him with the stones and he tried to fight back that jungle knife.  We hit where - as it was not in the campus of the mine, it's was like a dump inside there, there were iron bars there, zincs and all that, so Steve hit him with an iron bar on the head and as he fell down I managed to take his jungle knife and it's when we started to stab him.  \tI found that Mr Abram Maumakwe was already there when it happened, and it's when we hit him and we stabbed him, as Steve was hitting him with an iron bar.",
