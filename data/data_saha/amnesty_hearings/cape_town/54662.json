That refers to the Committee investigating an application for amnesty and it says that in respect of an investigation carried out under Section 19, the provisions of Sub-Section - of Section 30 Sub-Section 2 should be complied with.  Now that Section 30(2) deals with a person who is implicated in an application for amnesty and I will read Section (a) of Sub-Section 2\n\"If during any investigation by or any hearing before the Commission, any person is implicated in a manner which may be to his detriment\"\nAnd I want to emphasise the word: \"to his detriment\" in (a).  (b):\n\"The Commission contemplates making a decision which may be to the detriment of a person who has been so implicated\"\nNow that to me and to any person who has any legal training, suggests that a mere mention of a person in an uncorroborated statement, is not sufficient to implicate a person.  It's on that basis that I want the leader of evidence to explain to the Committee and to my client why on the basis of one solitary statement which gave rise to an investigation which was inconclusive, my client was brought before here. \n\tIt's quite important because what has happened in fact - if there is no sufficient explanation, there are issues I want to take up but I will give the leader of evidence an opportunity to respond to my response.  In terms of the reading of that Section and the definition of what implicated means, my client shouldn't be sitting here.\n\tThe investigation unit - apart from my client whom I think the Committee knows is the head of investigation and he recused himself from this investigation.  The second statement which was made by the witness here has very serious contradiction and inconsistencies with the first statement.  None of the things mentioned in the first statement were - could be said to link my client or my client's vehicle in any way to the Heidelberg Tavern attack unless there is a victimisation of my client or incompetence within the section that deals with leading of evidence  and we need an explanation Mr Chairman. \n\tI don't believe that in any way my clients presence here - and I want the leader of evidence to answer, does my client's presence and the bringing of the witness here, does it advance the case of the applicants in any way?  Secondly, if it doesn't advance the case of the applicants, does it hamper their case or does it show in any way that they should not be granted amnesty?  Does it counter their amnesty application?

I don't know exactly what investigations were done but when I came on board - that is on the 1st of October, I became aware through handling the Heidelberg case that there was this information.\n\tAnd because he was implicated in - by a witness, in the circumstances which suggested that his vehicle was used to convey automatic weapons away from the scene, he was deemed to be implicated and he was given notice via Mr Mpshe.  It was dealt with on that level, and up until today there has been no indication that there was any objection to that procedure being followed or any objection to anything that was done by the investigative unit or the amnesty department, so I can't add anymore than that at this stage Mr Chairman.",

Mr Prior is - I'm not suggesting in any way that Mr Prior is the only person who made this decision, I'm saying as a legally trained person, when you say: \"implicated\" and you look at the definition in 32, you can't go on one statement.  This statement was by a witness, that statement - when you read that statement, it in no way links my client to the Heidelberg incident, it in no way does that and one does not have to be legally trained to see that.\n\tAnd I will go through that Mr Chairman, what I would like to say now and raise this with - none of the applicants here - and they were asked by their counsel, none of them knew Mr Ntsebeza except perhaps from - as one of the applicants said, from the television that he is connected with the Truth Commission.  Each of the applicants said they had no dealings with an Audi, so the people who are here who are directly involved in that attack have said they do not know.  \n\tNow, when you look at evidence, I think what you do as a legally trained person and that is why I believe in the Amnesty Committee, everyone is a legal person so that you can weigh up the validity and the weight of the evidence before you and you look at the totality of the evidence, you don't simply look at one aspect and  you see whether that evidence is sufficient to make an inference that someone may be implicated.

In other words where someone is implicated as a result of an application for amnesty which is submitted in terms of Section 19.1.  Now, clearly there's nothing on the application forms that implicates Mr Ntsebeza.\n\tI acknowledge what Mr Prior's saying that in some respects - in respect of Madasi and Mabala, that these forms do not contain sufficient information but even then during the course of this proceeding if his name had cropped up, then it would be appropriate that the proceedings be stopped and that an implicated person then be given the warning that is required by 32 - that's the first thing.",

Now I appreciate it that in some - obviously if you're going to have an investigation and someone other than the applicant raises a very serious point and there's lot's of evidence, you can't ignore that simply because of Section 19.1.\n\tBut I think the point here is that it's the applicant that has to implicate the person that has to be notified and here in this - the applicants in fact specifically denied any knowledge of this thing, they did this in paragraph 6 and paragraph 7.  Mr Madasi was interviewed at Victor Verster prison on the 25th of July '97 and he denied - he confirmed what the operational vehicle is, that is the document we looked at prior to the adjournment Mr Chairman, and he denied two, three days later at an entirely different venue in the Free State or in Bloemfontein.  \n\tMr Gqomfa was approached and he also said that he doesn't know anything about an Audi, so what we are saying is that the applicants not only doesn't mention an Audi, they specifically deny both in their early evidence and here at the hearing  and it's on that basis that I'm saying there was not sufficient evidence.  \n\tOn a proper reading of 19, Section 19 (1) and (2) and Section 30 (2), our view is that there was not sufficient reason to serve a notice on our client in terms of Section 19 and that's all Mr Chairman.  Perhaps what I would like to say now is that I will leave it to you, I would like to perhaps - once you've informed us of the decision that you have made, I would just like to make one brief sentence before we can proceed but I will hand it over to you now.",
