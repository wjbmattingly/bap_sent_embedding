It is onlywhen we got to the place which was identified by Nonxuba as the target did Irealise that it was the St James church. We had circled the church about threetimes. There were many cars and it appeared as if there were many people insidethe church. Mlambisa drove into the parking area at the church and parked approximately10 metres from the entrance to the church. Mlambisa reversed the car so thatthe back was facing the entrance. Nonxuba and Makoma got out, each one armedwith a rifle and a grenade. They then entered the church. I heard a grenadeand gunshots and then saw a red car stopping in front of us, apparently to blockus. I got out of the car and threw a petrol bomb at the car and Mlambisa gotout and shot at the car, causing the car to speed away. Then Nonxuba and Makomacame out of the church, jumped into the car and we immediately sped away. Idid not do what I was supposed to do, that is to throw the petrol bombs insidethe church. I do not know what happened inside the church, but I am fully awarethat with the arms and ammunition carried by Makoma and Nonxuba, that peoplewould be killed or injured. When we were in the car and making our getaway,Makoma said that someone had shot at him inside the church and that he was bleeding,but neither Makoma, nor Nonxuba said what happened inside the church. Nonxubadid, however, ask why I did not throw the petrol bomb and then I explained tohim why I did not do so. We then drove to a place under the direction of Nonxuba.I later learned that this place is called Ottery. Mlambisa and I left Nonxubaand Makoma there at a house in Ottery with the weapons. Mlambisa and I tookthe car to a scrap yard in Ottery, left it there and returned to this houseon foot. We slept at the house that night. That same night, we watched the newson",
