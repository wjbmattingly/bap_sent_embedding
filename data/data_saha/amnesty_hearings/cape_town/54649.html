<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>HUMPHREY LUYANDA GQOMFA:   (s.u.o.)</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Mr Arendse, I had an opportunity after we adjourned yesterday to read your client's statement which was handed in and with regard to various points which I want to ask him about but in particular he refers in paragraph 9, to four operations he was involved in and which he has applied for amnesty for.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> Yes, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> I asked the office here to obtain these applications for me - I did so only this morning and I have been given a file which contains as far as I can see, only one application that is in respect of an incident at the Zastron Road near the Sterkspruit bridge, I don't know if you are aware of that application.  And there's also a letter written by the Executive Secretary of the Amnesty Committee, saying that he has made application for an incident in Lady Grey, an incident in Zastron and an incident in Umtata and various incidents in and around Cape Town.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a>	The first three that I referred to were all in 1992 and must be three of the four that he refers to in his statement which he confirmed.  He said he was involved in four incidents in 1992 as I understand the statement.  Can you tell me what those incidents were and whether there have been in fact amnesty applications made in respect of all of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  I think the best person to ask is perhaps Mr Gqomfa - to explain to us Mr Chairman, if he be recalled.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you not aware of them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> I am aware of them and I took instructions in that regard but I think it would be best if he explains that.  At the time that we consulted he wasn't comfortable with us disclosing that in his statement because as far as he was concerned this was about the Heidelberg Tavern matter, so perhaps it's best that he be asked directly Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Did you hear what I said to your counsel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR GQOMFA:</span> Yes, I heard it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Right, what were the four incidents that you were involved in 1992?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR GQOMFA:</span> It is the incidents that you referred to, the first one ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The interpreter could not hear the speaker.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just talk a little loudly because the interpreter can't hear you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR GQOMFA:</span> Okay.  It is the incidents that the Chair referred to, the first one was on the 18th of March 1992, it was in connection with</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a>the Zastron bridge.  The second one happened in Lady Grey, I think it occurred on the 22nd of March 1992.  The third one on the 10th or the 11th of October 1992 as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> What was that one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR GQOMFA:</span> It was at Xhalanga in Xhlala, is that the one you're talking about -  the 11th of March 1992?  The fourth one happened in Umtata at the police station, it was in 1992 but I cannot remember the date right now - that was before the October one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Sorry, let me clear - the first was at Zastron on the 18th of March, the Zastron bridge one, the second one was at Lady Grey on the 22nd of March, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR GQOMFA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> And the third one was where?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Umtata.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR GQOMFA:</span> The third one happened in Xhlala in Transkei - Xhalanga bottle store - I think that's what it was called, on the 10th or 11th of October ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> '92?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR GQOMFA:</span> 1992, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> And the fourth is the Umtata police station and is that - the date given in this letter is July 1992?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR GQOMFA:</span> This is the one I'm not sure about the date, however it was before the Xhlala incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> And have you applied for amnesty in respect of all four of these incidents?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR GQOMFA:</span> Yes, I made applications for amnesty for all the incidents.  There are other incidents that I gave to Mr Mbandazayo, I think three others.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> You gave to who?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR GQOMFA:</span> Mr Mbandazayo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Now is there one - are  you also still facing trial in respect of the Zastron incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR GQOMFA:</span> Yes, I am going to court on the 3rd of March next year but those are not the cases I had referred to Mr Mbandazayo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> No, he said there were three other incidents he referred to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR GQOMFA:</span> Yes, there were three others that I referred to Mr Mbandazayo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Which court is that that you must go to for the Zastron incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> The Free State High Court.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR GQOMFA:</span> This was going to take place in Smithfield but it was postponed in Bloemfontein until next year.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> I would ask those responsible to see whether they can find the applications in respect of these matters and I hand over the file now and refer to the ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What has happened in respect of the Lady Grey matter, was there a trial?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR GQOMFA:</span> I burnt a farm house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Was anyone in it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR GQOMFA:</span> No, according to my knowledge there was no-one inside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did that result in a prosecution?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR GQOMFA:</span> No, there is one person who was charged for this, I was not in jail yet at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And what can you tell us about the Xhlala bottle store case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR GQOMFA:</span> What do you mean Sir, would you like the details of the incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, has there been a prosecution in that matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR GQOMFA:</span> No, nobody was sentenced, I was arrested - I could not hear the last words of the speaker, the previous sentence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> My question was, was there a prosecution, was there a file?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR GQOMFA:</span> Yes, I was out on bail for R500,00.  I did not go back because of other commitments and this case is still in the hands of the law.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> What were you charged with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR GQOMFA:</span> Armed robbery.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> And the Umtata police station?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR GQOMFA:</span> Nobody was arrested because they don't know who committed the crime.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> What crime?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR GQOMFA:</span> We raided the police station, we took the policemen's weapons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That armed robbery case, in which court was that supposed to take place - the trial?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR GQOMFA:</span> At a low Court in Xhlala.  As I said before there are three others - other matters, the ones I discussed with Mr Mbandazayo.  I don't know why you're not mentioning them, perhaps they did not get here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Well, could you tell us what these three others are - if you want to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR GQOMFA:</span> It was the killing of people, three different people.  I cannot remember clearly the dates now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, tell us who you killed and when and where.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR GQOMFA:</span> I cannot remember the dates, the one happened in Xhumbu between 1991 and 1992 - late '91, early '92.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who did you kill?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR GQOMFA:</span> Mr Siqholo, I don't know his first name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> How do you spell - do you know how you spell his name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR GQOMFA:</span> S-i-q-h-o-l-o.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Where did you kill him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR GQOMFA:</span> At Xhumbu in the Transkei.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Why did you kill him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR GQOMFA:</span> There was a political conflict between the ANC and the PAC, we had to defend ourselves because they were attacking - I've written down all the details in my form.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> What form?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR GQOMFA:</span> The application I handed over to Mr Mbandazayo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> An application for amnesty or what sort of application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Mr Chairman ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> I'm a little lost, are you appearing for him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> May I clarify Mr Chairman.  Mr Chairman, I visited him in prison in Bloemfontein.  I was visiting some of the prisoners in Bloemfontein also included.  There were applications which he gave to me which I think are those that I must send them to Cape Town, which I did Mr Chairman but unfortunately now I don't have the details because I didn't know that they will be required here because it was - we talked about Heidelberg incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a>	But I did forward them and I also wrote to the TRC and asked about these incidents, they confirmed that they have applications from him but I don't have the details now because I was coming for the Heidelberg incident - they are all in East London where I come from.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Who did you write to here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Mr Chairman, of late now I've communicating with Martin Coetzer - of late but before that it was difficult Mr Chairman, I must indicate that we were not having any response this incident.  In fact I have to make new applications for some who have lodged applications before because they couldn't get them so it was difficult until Martin Coetzer came into the picture and after that we were communicating and he told me some these applications were not there, so I have to - some of the applicants have to fill new application forms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> But in respect of this applicant you say that these three forms have been sent and are here at this office?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANDAZAYO:</span> Mr Chairman, I can confirm that because I did send them to this office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> All right, let's hear about the other two matters, you've mentioned the one at Xhumbu, what was the next one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR GQOMFA:</span> The other one was at Inxhobo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Tell us about it, what did you do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR GQOMFA:</span> We killed a man for reasons that I've detailed in the form.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, I want you to now tell me who you killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR GQOMFA:</span> Mr Stembele Mgcebeshe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can you spell that surname please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR GQOMFA:</span> N-g-c-e-b-e-s-h-e.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR GQOMFA:</span> I think it was 1992 but I'm not certain of the precise date.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And the third one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR GQOMFA:</span> The third one happened along the Mount Frere main road, I cannot remember this man's name at the moment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What did he say, the interpreter hasn't said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR GQOMFA:</span> I cannot remember the man's name at the moment, the third incident was at the main road in Mount Frere.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR GQOMFA:</span> I think it was in 1993, I cannot remember the exact date.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> And did you kill that man?</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR GQOMFA:</span> Yes, we killed him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you say: "We killed him", you and somebody else or just you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR GQOMFA:</span> There were other people too.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now in respect of these three matters - these three people, have there been any cases that have started against you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR GQOMFA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Arendse, it seems that once we've examined his application forms and after the matter has been fully investigated by the investigative unit, it may be necessary to have a special hearing in respect of these other matters.  For the time being we will proceed with the Heidelberg Tavern matter and you may now call the next applicant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Sorry before that, there are one or two points I would like to clear up with this applicant, again arising from his statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a>	You talk in your statement of going to the Heidelberg Tavern about three days before the incident with Maxeba, the driver of the car and Makweso.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR GQOMFA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Did you drive to the Heidelberg Tavern on that occasion when you went to inspect it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR GQOMFA:</span> Yes, we drove.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> What car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The interpreter could not hear properly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Can you repeat the name of the type of car please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR GQOMFA:</span> It was a Ford Courier bakkie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Who provided it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR GQOMFA:</span> It is a car that Speech used all the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Who?</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR GQOMFA:</span> Sepiwe Makweso.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> You've talked about R4 rifles and AK47 rifles, do you know what calibre they are?</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR GQOMFA:</span> What do you mean by calibre?</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> The size of the cartridge - 9mm, 7.65?</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR GQOMFA:</span> I will answer you as follows:  I'm not well trained on the South African weapons, it is from the Eastern Block that I was well trained.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> So you don't know?  Is that the position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR GQOMFA:</span> What do you mean?</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> You don't know what the calibre of the cartridges are - if you do, tell me, don't tell me about training in the Eastern Block.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR GQOMFA:</span> As I said I cannot give you the answers because I don't know the calibre of the R4 rifles.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Do you know the calibre of an AK47?</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR GQOMFA:</span> If I remember correctly, it's 7.62 by 59 - if I'm not mistaken.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> I take it we can evidence about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...[inaudible]</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The speaker's mike is not on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> You told us that you were aware that the PAC had resolved at it's December 1993 Congress to intensive the armed struggle, did you attend that congress?</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR GQOMFA:</span> No, I did not go to the Congress.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Well who told you about the Congress?</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR GQOMFA:</span> The other Africans who were in the same region as myself that came back from the Congress.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Who?</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Other people.</p>

<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> So they will be able to talk of this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR GQOMFA:</span> What?</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> That the PAC had resolved to intensify the armed struggle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR GQOMFA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Prior to that the PAC had wanted to negotiate, hadn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR GQOMFA:</span> They were in the negotiations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> And you wrote about this when you applied for amnesty in respect of the Zastron application, didn't you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR GQOMFA:</span> I cannot hear the question clearly or understand the question clearly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> You gave a lengthy explanation in your application for amnesty in respect of the Zastron application, didn't you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR GQOMFA:</span> Which application, the one that I'm about here today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> The Zastron, the Zastron bridge application that we have spoken about already - that you have confirmed happened on the 18th of March 1992, you remembered the date, why are you know having difficulty remembering the application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR GQOMFA:</span> The thing is, I do not understand the question clearly because of the following reasons, I don't know whether you are still talking about the 1992 Congress or the 1993 Congress and I don't know what the Zastron incident has to do with that so please be clear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> I asked you if you made a lengthy explanation when you lodged that application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR GQOMFA:</span> Specifically the Zastron application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR GQOMFA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> There you said</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a>"This was also to pressurise the Government through it's electorate, that they must take the negotiation process seriously and in good faith"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a>Do you remember writing that as a reason for what you did?  </p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR GQOMFA:</span> Now I understand clearly.  I think you will also remember that this prevailing situation at the time, the political situation - just to refresh your memory, there was Codessa 1 and Codessa 2.  The PAC realised that this was not a genuine platform where we could negotiate about the country matters.  First of all there were too many shortcomings in that Codessa, as a result you will remember the stand the PAC took - you could not be a player and a referee at the same time.  The PAC then demanded a neutral venue under a neutral Chairman.  The approach to Codessa 1 and Codessa 2 proved the stand and the reservation of the PAC ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> Could the speaker repeat the last three sentences please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR GQOMFA:</span> What I was saying is, firstly you will remember well the political situation at the time.  The PAC took a stand that they needed a neutral Chairman under a neutral value where these negotiations would take place.  Our position was, they could not be players and referees at the same time - this was done by the racist regime.  They were negotiating and supporting third force elements at the same time and innocent African people were being killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a>	There was no sincerity from the South African Government, that is why the PAC took the stand that it did.  The White people - we wanted the White people to understand that we are not blood-thirsty.  We realised that our liberation would end up being the liberation of the White man.  We needed to remove that stigma that Azanian people had, we take them as our fellow countrymen.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a>	The reservations and the fears of PAC were such that Codessa was not a genuine platform to negotiate about the South African situation that ended up a failure - I think history proved us right.  I hope that everything is clear.</p>

Immediately afterwards she heard sound similar to firecrackers and then there was chaos in the tavern".</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a>Insofar as that refers to the attack, what is your comment - that two persons, Black persons entered the tavern, one shorter than the other immediately before the shooting?</p>
