The Committee has thereforedecided that notwithstanding the fact that the closing date has yet to be proclaimed,overall convenience to all parties, including the applicants, dictates thatthe hearing should proceed today.

This is also a publicly known political liberation movement and italso waged a political struggle against the State at the time. The applicantsdid associate themselves with APLA as is contemplated in Section 22G of theAct. \n\tFurthermore itis submitted, Mr Chairman, that the particular offences in respect of whichamnesty is sought by the applicants are offences associated with a politicalobjective when one has regard to the following:\n\tThe motive ofthe applicants who committed the offences in question were clearly politicalin that at the time in question they were furthering the aims an objects ofan operation called Operation Great Storm. This was an operation adopted byAPLA and PASO. Just as much as there was at the time an operation adopted bythe Congress of South African Students, popularly known as COSAS, which wasa student organisation affiliated to the African National Congress, popularlyknown as the ANC. The main aim of both these operations was to make the townshipsungovernable, more particularly by preventing government and company suppliesand services from coming into the townships and also by killing, maiming andinjuring what was popularly known as settlers and this was a term that was usedto refer to White persons. \n\tThe context inwhich these offences were committed is that at the time a volatile politicalclimate prevailed, particularly in the township of Guguletu, when both operations,and that is Operation Great Storm and Operation Barcelona were put into operation.\n\tUnderlying thefurther aims of Operation Barcelona was to secure the recognition of the SouthAfrican Democratic Teachers Union, popularly known as SADTU by the State. Massivesupport was shown by students for teachers belonging to SADTU and to furtherthese objectives, and that is to gain recognition for SADTU, PASO declared itselfto be fully committed to that struggle, and to that end had adopted the slogan,One settler one bullet. \n\tThe objectiveof the offence in question was primarily directed at making townships ungovernableand was also aimed at destroying State and company property, State personneland private property and individuals. State personnel was also targeted. Alsotargeted was private property and individuals who were seen as standing in theway of realisation of these objectives. The applicants acted on the instructionsand with the approval of PASO and APLA. \n\tIt will be submittedthat the offences committed by the applicants were directly proportional tothe political objectives pursued by PASO and APLA.\n\tIn conclusion,Mr Chair, it is submitted that the offences committed by the applicants werenot for personal gain, they were not committed for personal malice, ill-willor spite but that they were purely politically motivated actions which werecommitted under the bona fide impression that the political objectivesof PASO and APLA were being pursued.\n\tThank you MrChair.",

            "Reads\n\"I the undersignedNtombeko Ambrose Peni do hereby make oath and state that\n1.\tIwas born in Cape Town on the 28th of September 1975 and I am 21 yearsold.\n\t\tIam a member of the Pan African Congress, the PAC and a member of thePan African Students Organisation PASO. \n\t2.\tThefacts to which I depose are true and correct and within my personalknowledge unless the context indicates otherwise.\n\t3.\tOn6th June 1995 I was sentenced to 18 years imprisonment by the High Courtsitting at Cape Town after that Court found me guilty of the murderof Amy Biehl on 25 August 1993. I am currently serving my sentence atthe Victor Verster prison.\n\t4.\tOn25 August 1993, I was 18 years old and I was attending Langa High School.On that day the Langa High School Unit of the Pan African Students Organisation,PASO, was re-launched at the school and I was elected chairperson ofthat unit.\n\t5.\tThere-launch of PASO was attended by between three to four hundred studentsfrom the Langa High School and the surrounding schools. I am personallyaware of the attendance of Easy Mzikhona Nofemela because we knew eachother having grown up in the same street at NY 111 in Guguletu. At thattime I had no personal knowledge of Vusumzi Samuel Ntamo or MongesiChristopher Manqina. I knew Ntamo and Manqina only by sight having seenthem on occasions at Pan African Congress and PASO meetings and marches.\n\t6.\tNofemelawas aged 22 at the time and was attending Joe Slovo High School.\n\t7.\tThemeeting which re-launched the Langa High Unit of PASO held on 25 August1993 lasted from between one to three pm that day. At the meeting politicalspeeches were made, the main speakers being Simpiwe Mxengu the regionalsecretary of PASO and Wanda Mathebula, the regional Chairperson of PASO.The speeches made by the speakers were militant and were characterisedby inter alia the following:\n1.\tThatthe battle to win back the land for the African people was not onlythat of the Azanian People's Liberation Army, APLA, but was onein which all of us must actively assist. The instruction was thatall PASO members must assist APLA operators on the ground and thatwe would do so making the country ungovernable.\n\t\t2.\tIn1993 APLA had adopted the slogan \"Year of the Great Storm\". Thatslogan was also adopted by PASO at that meeting and then put intooperation by PASO.\n\t\t3.\tPASOmembers were instructed to actively support the teachers' strikefor recognition and we were to refuse to pay examination fees, theaim being to destroy the whole system of education, and,\n\t\t4.\tThesespeeches were closed with the slogan One settler onebullet. I understood this slogan to applyto every White person who came into the line of fire during an APLAoperation or an operation to support APLA, or where we, as PASOmembers, were to assist in making the country ungovernable.\n\t8.\tThespeeches at the meeting and my election as Chairperson inspired me andmade me eager to \"operate\" to assist APLA. In fact Nofemela and I hadbeen receiving training from APLA operators in the township. This traininginvolved physical training, attending political classes and also instructionson how to handle arms and ammunition.\n\t9.\tAgroup of approximately 200 left the meeting and decided to walk to BonteheuwelStation. The balance of those who attended the meeting were those whoresided in Langa and they decided to stay behind. This group of approximately200 decided to walk from Langa to Bonteheuwel along Vanguard Drive withthe aim of targeting government and company vehicles. As we walked alongVanguard Drive we threw stones at some government and company vehicles.Whilst walking we were singing, toyi-toying and chanting political sloganslike 'One Settler one bullet'. \n\t\tAlongVanguard Drive we had stopped a truck and were in the process of tryingto burn it down but before we could do so the police came onto the sceneand we then threw stones at the police van damaging its windscreen.The policemen in the van were White policemen and they fired shots atus causing us to retreat. As we retreated we split into two groups,the one group going back to Langa and the other group, which includedme and Nofemela, moved onwards towards Bonteheuwel Station.\n\t10.\tNofemelaand I were now in a group of between 80 to 90 students. When we approachedBonteheuwel Station a train pulled into the station and we boarded thetrain. We passed Natrec Station and got out at Heideveld station. Weboarded the train at approximately something to four and disembarkedat Heideveld station at approximately five to ten minutes later.\n\t11.\tWewalked past NY110 to NY1 in Guguletu in a group of between 80 to 90,still toyi-toying, singing and chanting the slogan \"One settlerone bullet\". As we walked in a group we did not see anygovernment or company vehicles.\n\t\tNofemelaand I then walked to Iona shopping centre which is situated at NY1 inGuguletu. At the shopping centre we got onto a bakkie and this bakkietook us to section 3 in Guguletu, which is where we stay.\n\t\tWhilein the bakkie we had passed a BP garage, which is on the corner of NY1and Klipfontein Road, and there we noticed the other group which hadearlier retreated back to Langa station. Another group of students whomwe identified as Congress of South African Students, COSAS, has alsoformed themselves into a group. \n\t\tThebakkie was driven by a man named Maleleke. Maleleke works at the shopcalled Viveza which is situated at NY119 in Guguletu. I know him fromthe area. I do not know whether he also owned the bakkie.\n\t\tWhilstNofemela and I were on the bakkie we had approached the Caltex garagewhich is situated at NY1 and NY132 in Guguletu and it is here that wesaw Amy Biehl running across the road, that's in NY1 towards the garage.She was bleeding from the head. She was pursued by a group of betweenseven to ten people.\n\t\tIjumped off the bakkie and also pursued her, throwing stones at her.I did so twice. I was about three to four metres from her when I threwstones at her. Manqina tripped her and she fell and I saw Manqina almoston top of her making a stabbing motion towards her. Stones were alsobeing thrown at her from a very short distance. Nofemela also jumpedoff the bakkie....\"\n\tCan I just pausethere Mr Chairman and learned members, to make an amendment which has been discussedwith applicant Peni, just wishes to change the next sentence to read as I amgoing to read it into the record,\n\".....Nofemelahad also jumped off the bakkie and he threw stones at Amy Biehl\".\nThank you.\n\"Allthis was happening very quickly and soon after we arrived on the scenethe police arrived and the crowd dispersed in all directions. I myselfran home.\n\t13.\tIconfirm having filled in the amnesty application in May 1997 when Iwas assisted by Letlhapa Mpahlele, the Director of APLA operations.\n\t\tIam applying for amnesty because I have been found guilty of killingAmy Biehl by a court of law.\n\t\tIparticipated in the killing of Amy Biehl.\n\t\tIam also taking responsibility as PASO Chairperson.\n\t\tIdeeply regret the killing of Amy Biehl and I ask her parents, relativesand friends to forgive me.\n\t14.\tIalso wish to comment on the statement made by Comrade Makwetu, who isnow the ex-President of the PAC, whose comments appear on pages 36 and37 of the record which is before the Committee.\n\t\tFirstly,it is correct that PASO is not part of APLA. However, on the day inquestion when Amy Biehl was killed the PASO leadership implored andinstructed us to assist APLA in its struggle by making the country ungovernableand by preparing the groundwork for APLA operators.\n\t\tSecondly,it is correct that at the time there was a strike by SADTU in the WesternCape and we as students supported that strike. We also supported OperationBarcelona which was the slogan of COSAS, an ANC affiliate.\n\t\tThirdly,however, at the PASO meeting that day we were incited by militant politicalspeeches and we were instructed to support Operation Great Storm whichwas adopted by APLA in 1993 and which PASO adopted and supported. Thisoperation involved using essentially the same tactics as that to beadopted by Operation Barcelona, i.e. to make the country ungovernableand to refuse to pay school examination fees.\n\t15.\tIwas arrested in October 1993 and I was held for two days. I was requiredto attend an identification parade, but at the identification paradenone of the witnesses called to testify against me could identify me.I was then released but rearrested on 13 January 1995 and I was convictedof the Amy Biehl murder in June 1995.\n\t16.\tIrespectfully submit that,\n1.\tMyapplication for amnesty complies with the requirements of the Act\".\nThat is now subjectto what Judge Ngoepe correctly pointed out, that formally it doesn't complybecause of the cut-off date hasn't been promulgated.\n\"2.\tThatthe offence in respect of which I was found guilty, namely the murderof Amy Biehl, was an offence which is associated with a politicalobjective committed in the course of the conflicts of the past andwhich complies with the criteria set out in Section 20(2) and (3)of the Act and,\n3.\tIhave made full disclosure of all the relevant facts.\n\tSigned byNtombeko Ambrose Peni, signed and attested to on the 7th day of July 1997\".\n\tMr Chairman thenthere are just a few questions I would like to put to Mr Peni myself beforethe Committee does.",

At the time I was a student at Joe SlovoHigh School and I was an organiser for PASO. \n\t\tBythe time I left the meeting I felt very inspired by the political speechesmade at the meeting. To that extent I was in the group, together withPeni, which stoned a truck and a police vehicle along Vanguard Driveon our way to Bonteheuwel Station.\n\t\tIconfirm further, having boarded the train at the Bonteheuwel Stationtogether with Peni and a group of between 80 and 90 students. We disembarkedat the Heideveld Station and from there we marched in a group lookingfor Government and company vehicles to stone. \n\t\tIconfirm further that Peni and I had got onto a bakkie at the Iona ShoppingCentre in Guguletu as the bakkie was to go in the direction in whichwe were staying, namely in Section 3. \n\t5.\tWegot to the scene of the incident at the Caltex garage at NY1 and NY132whilst on this bakkie. This is where I saw Amy Biehl stumble acrossthe road, NY1. I jumped off the bakkie and ran towards her also throwingstones at her. As we pursued her Manqina tripped her. I had a knifeand with seven or eight others we stabbed at Amy. I do not know whetherI in fact stabbed her. I stabbed at her about three or four times. Ialso went to throw stones at the vehicle and with others tried to overturnit. When the police van arrived I ran away.\n\t6.\tIhave received training from APLA operators in the township, which trainingincluded physical training, attending political classes and demonstrationson how to handle arms and ammunition. \n\t\tAtthe time of the Amy Biehl incident the only other applicant known tome was Peni. We were brought up together and lived in the same streetat NY111 Guguletu.\n\t\tIhave only come to know Vusumzi Samuel Ntamo and Mongesi ChristopherManqina after I was arrested with them and appeared in the lengthy trialwith them.\n\t7.\tIhad made a statement to the police. It appeared at record 48 and 49.This statement is largely correct except the failure to disclose myparticipation in the killing of Amy Biehl. I made it freely, voluntarilyand without any undue influence. I apologise to the High Court and tomy lawyers for challenging the admissibility of the statement on thebasis that I was forced to make it. The statement confirms my attendanceat the meeting at the Langa High School and that at NY1 and NY132 Ithrew a stone at a light brown motor vehicle.\n\t\tItis also correct that I ran away after the police arrived on the scene.\n\t\tThereference to the stoning of a big truck is the reference to a truckwhich was stoned in Vanguard Drive and not at NY111. The only explanationI can give for the reference to NY111 in my statement is that I madethe statement in Xhosa and it was translated into Afrikaans. In anycase I had pleaded not guilty and denied having made the statement freelyand voluntarily and that is why this aspect of my statement was notchallenged by me or by my legal representatives at the time.\n\t\tIwish to confirm also that on the day in question and during that periodI was highly politically motivated, not only by the political climateprevailing in the township but also by the militant political speechesmade at the PASO meeting which I had attended. At the time PASO wasacting in solidarity with COSAS, employing the same tactics, namelyattempting to make the township ungovernable by stoning government andcompany vehicles. \n\t\tTheslogan One Settler, one bullet also inspired me to hurt,injure or kill White people. \n\t8.\tOnthe day in question I actively participated in the killing of Amy Biehl.\n\t\tIdo deeply regret what happened to her and I wish to sincerely apologiseto her parents, relatives and her friends, and I seek their forgiveness.The deed was committed at the time when we, as PASO members, were highlypolitically motivated and when we were hostile towards any Settler whomwe regarded as any White person living in this country.\n\t\tAtthe time we were still under White minority rule and the objective ofPASO was to make this country ungovernable by whatever means necessary.\n\t9.\tIrespectfully submit that I have made out a proper case for amnesty tobe granted by this Committee as contemplated by Section 20 of the Promotionof National Unity and Reconciliation Act 1995.\n\t\tMyapplication complies with the requirements of the Act...\"\non the proviso thatwas mentioned by Justice Ngoepe being met and satisfied.\n\"\tTheoffence in respect of which I was convicted and that is the murder ofAmy Biehl, is an offence which was associated with a political objectivecommitted in the course of the conflict of the past and which complieswith the provisions of Section 20(2) and (3) of the Act.\n\t\tIwould furthermore respectfully submit that I have made full disclosureof all the facts relevant to the Amy Biehl incident and to this application\".",

I attended that meeting with Ntamo.I also attended the meeting in my capacity as vice chairperson of theGuguletu Comprehensive Unit branch of PASO. \n\t\tIconfirm that political speeches were made at the meeting as describedby Peni in his affidavit and that we were inspired and motivated bythe militant speeches made.\n\t\tWeleft that meeting in a group but that group split into two groups afterthe police had arrived on the scene in Vanguard Drive while we werestoning a truck and trying to burn it.\n\t\tNtamoand I were in a group which ran towards the Langa Station. We were about50 to 60 people in the group. We ran towards the Langa Station but therewas a delay because someone had allegedly stolen a gun from a policeman.When the Khayelitsha train came we changed platforms and boarded thattrain and got off at the Heideveld Station.\n\t\tWegot to Heideveld just before five p.m. We re-grouped and walked alongNY110 towards NY1. On the corner of NY1 and NY110 there is an ApostolicChurch and this is where I met a girlfriend. She wanted to know whatwas happening and I told her that we had been at a meeting and thatwe were on the lookout for \"targets\", by which was meant governmentand company vehicles.\n\t\tAtthis point we were singing and chanting political slogans. \n\t\tWhileI was talking to this girl I saw that a truck was being stoned by therest of the group. NY132 is about 15 to 20 metres from the corner ofNY1 and NY110 where I was talking to this girl. \n\t\tAbeige Mazda 323 was also being stoned. The car stopped and the driver,Amy Biehl, stumbled out of the car and started running towards the Caltexpetrol station. We chased after her and I tripped her and she fell downnext to a box with the name \"Caltex\" inscribed on it. I asked one ofthe persons in the crowd for a knife. I got the knife and moved towardsAmy Biehl as she was sitting down in front of the box facing us. I satin front of her, probably a foot or two away, I took the knife and stabbedher once in front on her left-hand side. I only stabbed her once. Sevenor eight others armed with knives also stabbed at her. \n\t\tIheard the evidence of Professor Knoebel at court and he confirmed thatshe was stabbed once and that this blow was fatal. I accept that itmust have been the wound which I inflicted.\n\t\tAsI stabbed her some people were still throwing stones at her and someof these stones struck me on the shoulder. However, I only sufferedsome minor injury which did not require any treatment. \n\t\tAfterI stabbed her the police came and I saw people running away and thatis when I also decided to run away.\n\t\tIstabbed Amy Biehl because I saw her as a target, a Settler. \n\t\tIwas highly politically motivated by the events of that day and by theclimate prevailing in the township. Political tensions were furtherheightened after White policemen and some White passers-by had shotat us along Vanguard Drive.\n\t\tIhave always been inspired by the slogan \"One Settler, onebullet\". I share the understanding of the meaningof the slogan as set out by Peni in his affidavit.\n\t\tIconfirm that Ntamo and I are friends because we grew up together inLanga, but I have only come to know Peni and Nofemela because of theAmy Biehl case. I may have seen them that day, but like many othersin the crowd, I did not know them.\n\t\tIconfirm that I had completed my application form which is on the recordat pages 18 to 20 on the 9th of May 1997 with the assistance of LetlhapaMpahlele. I had also completed the application form in Xhosa which isfound at record pages 21 - 26. The translation appears from the recordat pages 27 - 33.\n\t\tIwish to deal with some of the particulars which I mentioned in my application.\n\t\tFirstly,in paragraph 9 at record 28 I mention that I killed Amy Biehl. I alsomentioned the names of Nofemela and Ntamo.\n\t\tInparagraph 10(a) at the record pages 29 and 30 I mention that the objectivewas to get the government to abolish Standard 10 examination fees. Thisis correct. \n\t\tAtthe time there was large-scale dissatisfaction amongst PASO membersand all Black students about examination fees which we had to pay. Atthe time COSAS had also launched Operation Barcelona which we, as PASO,supported.\n\t\tTheissue of fees was also on the agenda at the PASO meeting which we attendedon 25 August 1993.\n\t\tInparagraph 10(b) at the record on page 30, I set out my justificationfor committing the murder of Amy Biehl. I have always been inspiredby the slogan \"One Settler, one bullet\", and at the timeI was aspiring to become an APLA operator. When the PASO executive membersordered us to go out and prepare the groundwork for APLA and to makethe township ungovernable I regarded this as an instruction to alsoharm, injure and kill White people.\n\t\tWhenI saw that the driver of the vehicle which we had stoned, and whichhad come to a standstill was a White person I immediately asked oneof the comrades in the crowd for a knife. For me this was an opportunityto put into practice the slogan, \"One Settler, one bullet\".\n\t\tInparagraph 11(a) of the record at page 31 I state that the deed was committedunder the instruction of Sabelo Pama. Pama of course is now deceased.In 1993, either in March or June, SABC TV had relayed a speech madeby Pama which inspired me. Pama was a very well-known military figurein APLA. It is not correct, as I state in my application, that he mentionedOperation Barcelona. It is well-known that Operation Barcelona was aCOSAS slogan. \n\t\tMentionof \"this is the year Cream Stone\", is not correct. It should read \"thisis the year of Operation Great Storm\". Operation Great Storm was ofcourse adopted by PASO and was also adopted by the PASO meeting thatday. \n\t\tDuringthe criminal trial the statement made by Ntamo was admitted as evidence....\"\nand his statementMr Chairman, is at record pages 49 and 50.\n\"Inthat statement he correctly mentioned that I had asked for a knife andthat I was the one who stabbed Amy Biehl\".\nThat's on the recordat page 50.\n\"Ideeply regret what I did. I lied during the criminal trial in orderto get off. I did not reveal to my legal representatives that I hadstabbed Amy Biehl and throughout the trial I had maintained my innocence.I was, however, subjected to ill-treatment by the police and they forcedme to make a statement. What I had said in the statement was, however,largely correct, namely that I was the one who stabbed Amy Biehl.\n\t\tIwish to apologise to my legal representatives and to the Court whichfound me guilty, for not telling them the truth. I am now revealingto this Committee what actually happened.\n\t\tIapologise sincerely to Amy Biehl's parents, family and friends and Iask their forgiveness.\n\t\tIrespectfully submit that I have made out a proper case for this Committeeto grant me amnesty as contemplated by Section 20 of the Act. \n\t\tIrespectfully submit that I have complied with the requirements of theAct that the offence which I committed was associated with a politicalobjective committed in the course of the conflicts of the past and thatit complies with the provisions of Section 20(2) and (3) of the Actthat I have made full disclosure of all the facts relevant to the AmyBiehl murder and to this application\".\nEnd of affidavit.Thank you.\n\tI don't haveany additional questions to ask Mr Manqina.\nNO EXAMINATION BYADV ARENDSE",
