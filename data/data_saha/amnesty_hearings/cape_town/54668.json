            "Gentlemen, there is one point I would like to raise with you before we commence and that is the question of this video and the alleged statement about a Tokarev pistol or machine gun.  If anything is to be made of it, it seems to me it would be desirable that an attempt should be made either to get the evidence of the person alleged to have been in possession of it or to get other policemen to identify the policeman in the video who are speaking about, so we can get their direct evidence as to what they were talking about, rather than asking us to draw inferences from something that appears on a video at a time that is, by no means, certain.\n\tYou will all recollect, at least my recollect is that Mr Bellingan's evidence on this aspect was that he knew nothing the video and was not prepared to comment or commit itself which, I think, he is entitled to do, but if you do want to rely on something there, I think we should have, get the police to produce the gentleman, I forget his name for the moment, but his name was given and either have him here or one of the other people who appear in the video.  \n\tThe second point which I would invite your comments on, and that is that if Mr Mbane is to give evidence and is questioned, it would be desirable that we should have the whole of the statement he made, not an edited version.  At the moment paragraphs 36 to 64 are missing from the statement, which may well effect his credibility and it may well be something that people wish to question him about.  So, I think that if he is to be called we would like to have the whole of it.  Do you agree, gentlemen?",

Firstly, there was the open budget, the police budget, and from that the vehicles and the travelling allowances were paid.  That was paid from an open budget, there was no direct confidentiality regarding that.  Should a secret fund be used, like in this instance, the funds would come from the secret fund and there were certain written down instruction which we, as group leaders, had to follow and send through the channels to Colonel de Kock at the top.  This was regarding this vehicle and its fuel.\n\tThe answer she wants regarding the claims, regarding the head-money, that was according to certain instructions by the security branch.  Head-money would be paid from a secret funds to the so-called askaris and then the Black members being involved in certain operation and the onus would rest on the section head to determine who would receive which monies.  That money would come from the secret fund and the Kombi's money came from the secret fund.  If I have taken, would send them to certain bars or certain hotels, smuggling hotels, I would obtain money from the secret fund.  They would sign receipts and they would account for what they have done and I would report back to Colonel de Kock.  There were certain written down instructions.  I do not have any documents regarding that, but I hope I have answered your question.  \n\tThe askaris would be paid, they were registered as police sources and later on when they became Constables they would receive money from the open budget.

I used a police helicopter to take aerial photographs of Crossroads.  They wanted to attack the police helicopter while Mbane said do not do that, you are going to get trouble from the Boers side.  That was my instruction to them, teach them to shoot and speak propaganda, but do not go into operations.

Every month meetings were held, in-service training was held and later on, because of my experience and because I was one of the older members at that unit, I drew up certain documents regarding deployment and, for example, when I was involved in this training, I referred to these documents so that they know what the haves and the have nots were or what they had to do.\n\tIt was not like them being like a pack of wild dogs.  There was certain order in everything, there were certain, what were the instructions regarding arrests, when there were shootouts.  This document is part of that.  What should the people do when they were for three, in the veld for three weeks.  When they returned to Pretoria they had to do  certain things after they had come back.  They had to do research at the Research Desk, C2, they had to bring their photo albums up to date, they had to know about new legislation.  \n\tSo, this document does not have a heading, because it is part of that type of document. We have tried, for this application, to find bits and pieces of all old documentation.  This is an in-service documentation, because based on this, instructions would be given regarding the servicing of the vehicles and if certain askaris, if they were involved in a false flag operation, they had to be careful.  For example, they had to know whether the specific person I needed to apprehend should not know me, for example.  When an askari worked in a certain area, the liberation, they have heard from the liberation fighters that he had been arrested or he is co-operating with the security police.  Therefore, I could not send in a person to infiltrate if they knew he had already been apprehended.  You should be aware and prepare safeguards so that these people should not be ambushed.
