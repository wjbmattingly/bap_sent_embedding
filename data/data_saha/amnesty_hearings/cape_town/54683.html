<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> This is a sitting of the Amnesty Committee. The present members of the Committee are Judge Mall as Chairman, Judge Wilson on my left and Ms Khampepe on my right.  The leader of evidence is Mr Robin Brink and the attorney appearing for the applicant is Mr Williams.  Are we ready to proceed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Before we do, can you turn that light slightly up or slightly sideways.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Mr Chairperson and members of the Committee, this is the application of Patrick Ndlumbini for amnesty.  The victims concerned were Ndimphiwe Nthekiso and Eric Xegetwane. Mr Nthekiso was served with a form 2 notice, by registered post at his last known address which was care of the SAPS, Onluste-eenheid 10, Maitland.  That was the address given to me by the prosecutor of the Wynberg Magistrate's Court - Regional Court, rather.   Mr Xegetwane, we had great difficulty in tracing the man, but I understand from my colleague that in fact he saw him at court recently and advised him that the matter was proceeding, but Mr Xegetwane not only indicated he was not the slightest bit interested in this application or indeed, with the continuing proceedings in court.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a>	The position relating to the applicants in this matter, is that he has, I understand, pleaded guilty to the charges and has been convicted very recently. But he is to return to court for sentencing on or about the 16th of July this year.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a>	I do not know whether Mr Nthekiso is present. May I just ascertain?</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Please do.  Mr Williams, are you ready to proceed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.  Mr Chairman, before I proceed with leading the applicant, I just want to give a short background, your Worship - Mr Chairman, with regard to this matter.   The trial of - this case has been partly heard.  Initially the applicant pleaded not guilty in respect of both charges relating to both victims.  The reason for that was that the only evidence that the State had was a confession which was allegedly extracted from the applicant under duress. It is on that basis, he contested the admissibility of the confession.  The matter has been protracted and continued over a lengthy period and at the last court hearing, the applicant pleaded guilty in respect of the one matter, and that is the one relating to the Ndimphiwe Nthekiso.  The reason being that the other victim, Mr Eric Xegetwane indicated that he is not interested in the court proceedings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a>	So the case had been postponed for sentencing to the 16th of July.  Mr Chairman, I will not proceed with leading the further applicant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just stand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Are you prepared to take an oath?</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">PATRICK NDLUMBINI:</span> (Duly sworn, states).</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR WILLIAMS:</span> Mr Ndlumbini, are you going to give your evidence in English or in Xhosa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> I think I am asking for the Xhosa. I would prefer Xhosa, I would use the Xhosa language, if it is necessary.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> Mr Ndlumbini, are you a member of any political organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> I am a member of the African National Congress, MK.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> When did you join this organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> I joined the organisation in 1985, in the African National Congress. I went for training inside the country underground and then I left in 1988, early 1988. I crossed the borders.  I went to Zambia. From Zambia I went to Angola, I was training there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> Can you tell the Committee what is the reason why you joined the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> It is because of the oppression here in South Africa, that was one of the reasons that made me, and some of my comrades were killed.  They were killed, that was in the Guguletu 7.  They were killed under the regime of apartheid. I was forced to go there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> So is it correct that you saw the ANC as a vehicle for effecting change in South Africa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> Yes, I have seen that ANC is only the organisation that will bring the changes here in South Africa, and I take my decision to go and join the African National Congress.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> You mention that you received military training whilst you were outside the country.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> Yes, after I joined the African National Congress, I received - I have received military training here inside the country, and then I have fulfilled the missions.  I was ordered to attack certain places and then after that, yes, and then I moved.  When after that I moved out of the country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> Mr Ndlumbini, did you receive military training whilst you were outside the country?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> Yes, I received military, my basic training was in Angola and then also I finished my training in Tanzania.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> When did you return to South Africa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> I returned to South Africa in 1991, the time the exiles were coming back home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> Now after you returned back to South Africa, what work did you do, where did you work?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> At that time I started to be assistant guard of Comrade Chris Hani.  So we were guarding Chris Hani, the time he was visiting Cape Town.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> So were you based in Cape Town?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> Yes, I was here in Cape Town.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> And can you give the Board an indication what happened whilst you were guarding Chris Hani?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> Well, the time I was guarding Chris Hani we were attending the meetings in Crossroads and Khayelitsha and in Hermanus, where Comrade Chris Hani was going to brief the people about the development.  And after that we were on the way to Stellenbosch.  So it is where Comrade Chris Hani explained to us that there are - we are in the car, the Mercedes-Benz and three comrades inside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> Yes, you can continue. Continue?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> So I was at the back with Comrade Chris and Comrade Xhoxho who passed away.  Xhoxho, he was shot dead.  So we were, it was me and him and the driver and Comrade Chris, and Comrade Chris is telling us that the people are complaining and the MKs here inside the country, but there are attacks that the people are complaining with, that at night there are attacks - he tell us about the death squad and also the detectives and the taxi wars and the gangsters and all these things.  So he explained to us that we must take initiatives because we are the soldiers, we are here, and now the people, they are looking at us and as they know that we are inside the country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a>	So we was waiting for him to tell us something but so he tell us that no, you must take initiative and you must ask the civic organisation, so that they can discipline people.  So those disciplined people who can ask from civics so that we can train them, so that these people can defend the people from these attacks of which, at that time in 1991, it was happening in our townships, you see.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> You referred now to taxi wars and gangsters.  Who were they actually attacking?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> In the question of taxi war, there were a lot of fighting in New Crossroads, also in Guguletu, also all around.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Were these people disorganising the life of the community, by the violence they were bringing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> Yes, because what was happening, the innocent people were killed,  you see and the people who were not involved in this taxi wars.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> And is it correct that Chris Hani essentially told you that you must start protecting these people, the community?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> I don't understand that to be from his application. What Mr Hani told you, wasn't it, that you must form self-defence units in the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> This was a community effort, that you should get members of the civic community to form self-defence units and you must train them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> Yes. Yes. Yes, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> This is the submission made by the ANC in their latest submission last week, when they said that, explained that civic defence units were established in communities under attack as a joint protect between the ANC and the community concerned, and that the legitimacy of the self-defence structures were recognised in terms of the National Peace Accord.  And as I understand it, that this is what this applicant was asked to do.  That is so, is it not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> That's correct, Judge Wilson.  Now can you tell the Committee, did you act as a result of what Mr Hani told you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> Yes, we started to ask the people because we had seen the people patrolling and at night, but patrolling, they are not sleeping, especially in the - the people were old that were patrolling.  So we tell them that okay, we are going to assist them. We joined them.  We inform the civic and then it is where we get certain comrades from the - to patrol the whole night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> Mr Ndlumbini, can we come to the specifics of this application before the Committee.  Is it correct that on the 13th of October 1991, yourself and some comrades were involved in some activity, more particularly an attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> We were involved in the attack of the police van.  Our aim was to disarm the police so that we can arm our self-defence units.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> Now in the process of attacking the police, did you foresee the possibility that policemen could be injured or attacked or killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> Whereas it was not our aim to kill someone in that van, our aim was only to capture the weapons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> But did you foresee the possibility that policemen could be killed or injured whilst you tried to extract their weapons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> Yes, we have seen that they could be only injured or dead in that instant, whereas it was not our aim to kill somebody.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> If I understand you correctly, you are saying that you did foresee the possibility. Did you have any problems that if policemen were injured or attacked or killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> Well, on the following day when I see that the van didn't stop, when we are ambushing it, I buy the paper and see that there are - they said they are slightly injured.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just tell us what happened on that night before you talk about what happened in the paper the next day.  What happened on the night after you attacked the van.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> Well, I was - one was carrying the R4 rifle.  I started to shoot at the van and my aim was to stop the van.  And the van didn't stop, it run away.  And then it is where my colleagues started to shoot at the van. I was already - I was already shot at the van nine shots, with the R4 rifle, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And what happened that night after that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> When we see that the van didn't stop, we went to go and put our bonds and patrol the areas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Did the van stop?</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> The van didn't stop, it just ran through.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> Mr Ndlumbini, before you continue, can I ask you if you are not going to speak in Xhosa, that you take off the head-phones.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> You have told us you fired nine shots with an R4 rifle. Were your companions armed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> Yes, they were armed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> What with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> They were armed with a shot-gun and hand-guns.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Four of them, three of them were armed, were they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> They were armed, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> And did they fire?</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> I'm sorry?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Did they fire shots?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> Yes, they, I think they fired shots within that moment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> What happened after that? The night when you attacked the police vehicle, were you at that stage aware whether anyone was injured or killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> On that night we were not aware that anyone was killed until we buy the paper. I buy the paper the following day and find that there was slightly injured, some police were injured.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> And you accept that the person that was injured is Mr Ndimphiwe Nthekiso, a policeman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> Well, I was told at court that his name, but I didn't know who was in the van that time, because we were waiting for any vehicle of the patrolling, either the soldiers or the police.  We were just waiting for the situation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> This person, Mr Ndimphiwe Nthekiso, did you know  him personally?</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> No, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> Was the attack directed at him in his personal capacity or at police in general?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> I will say on police in general, because you can't know at night who is in the van on that time, on that "dinges".</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> Mr Ndlumbini, I will now go to the second incident in respect of which you are seeking amnesty and that is the attack relating to Mr Eric Xegetwane.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> Can you just tell the Committee how it came about that you decided to attack his house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> Well, after we - I don't still remember. I think it was after the week, you see, we attack this police van and then it happened that we attend our youth meeting now, because I am also a member of the New Crossroads youth organisation. I am a member of the branch there, the ANC branch.  So when we were attending, when we were in the meeting, well, some comrades call me that comrade was close to me, that time Chris Hani was briefing me, with him, about this action we must take, it was Comrade Xhoxho. So he call me and I explain about this house of Xegetwane.  I was already hear that there is a person who is Xegetwane who is involved in this perpetrating of taxi wars and all this things, you see.  He was one of the top people.  So he explained to me that the unit is taken a decision that today we must alarm Xegetwane that he must move out of New Crossroads.  Well, how we must attack the house so that they can, our aim was to shoo them, that they must move, because they are not needed in the community.  That is how we went there, ourselves and attack the house of Mr Xegetwane.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> Is it correct that this attack took place on the 27th of October 1991?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> Yes, if I still remember, I can't remember all the dates of this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Ms Ndlumbini, when you say that Comrade Xhoxho advised you that the unit had taken a decision, to attack Mr Xegetwane in order to scare him to leave his house, what unit are you referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> What?</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> In your evidence you say that Comrade Xhoxho told you that a unit had taken a decision to attack the house of Xegetwane in order to scare him out of his house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> What unit is this that you are referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> What ...?</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> The unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> The unit?  Oh.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> I heard you speaking of a unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> Oh, I am talking about the people who are working with them, you see.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Is this a self-defence unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> You are referring to the ANC Youth League?</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> No, we are just in the meeting there, in the ANC Youth League, but now we are talking about my unit is also the members of the Youth League, you see.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> So  Comrade Xhoxho was one of the members of your unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> And this decision had been taken in your absence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> By your unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Were you the leader of the unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> No, I was not the leader of the unit. The leader of the unit was Comrade Xhoxho.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Thank  you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> How many people were part of this attack on Mr Xegetwane's house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> We were the group of people, if I still remember we were six or more than six, eight, if I remember right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> Can you recall how many of these people were armed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> No, there were only two people armed on that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> Were you armed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> I was armed with a hand-gun and one of my comrades was armed with an R4, the same R4 rifle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> And did you shoot at Mr Xegetwane's house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> Yes, I shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> Do you know whether anyone was injured or killed in this attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> Well, I didn't see nothing, but our aim was not to kill somebody in the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Mr Ndlumbini, when you shot at Mr Xegetwane's house, did you not foresee the possibility that other persons, completely unconnected with his activities, could be injured, through your own attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> As it was at the night, all the people were sleeping and we were shooting at front, we will see that maybe some people can be injured, but it was really not our aim. On cross-fire it was going to happen like that, but it was not our aim to shoot at the innocent people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> On which part of the house then did you direct your shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> We direct our shooting on the front of the house, the wall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> What sort of house was it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> It was the house there with the two windows and the front, and the gate and a sort of garage and store, next-door something there, I think they are selling chickens or what.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> Was it a brick house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> It is the corner house but no, it is made with the zincs, they make the house with the shacks, it is like a garage with shacks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> Was that corrugated iron?</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> So R4 bullets would go straight through. Is that not so?  You had shot R4 rifles, you have done military training. You knew it would go straight through a corrugated iron house, wouldn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> Yes, we were, we knew that the R4 will penetrate there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> Did you foresee the possibility that Mr Xegetwane might be injured or killed in this attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> Yes, we foresee that he could be injured, but it was not our aim to injure any person, but to alarm ... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> You nonetheless, foresaw the possibility that people could be injured or be killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Did you know, Mr Ndlumbini, who was staying with Mr Xegetwane at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> I'm sorry?</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Did you know who was staying with Mr Xegetwane at the time in the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> Well, I didn't know who stayed in the house at that time. I didn't know even the house, you see, I was just seeing the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Who pointed the house to you, was that Comrade Xhoxho?</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> Well, as we were moving, you see, I was already knew the house is the house of the one of the perpetrators of this taxi war, you see.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Did you on your own make any attempt to find out if there were any other persons inside of the house at the time when your shots were directed at this shanty house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> No, I didn't knew that there is a person inside, you see.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> Mr Ndlumbini, in what respect did you say that this attack on Mr Xegetwane's house can be considered a political motive?</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> As me, I was instructed by Comrade Chris Hani to ask and protect the people, you see. I have seen that this taxi wars as they are killing the people or endanger the people, that this is our way to protect the people from this taxi war and also gangsters, as the previous government formed the sort of structures that they called Thunder Storm and Gold Storm and Thunder Storm and all these things, Springbok.  So that to delay the negotiation process.  So I see that this we were the counter of those activities from the Death Squad and all these things. We were countering that because really the people, they were in danger on that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> mr Ndlumbini, can you just tell me what are you doing now, where do you work now, what do you do with your life?</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> Now I am working, I am in the South African National Defence Force.  I am working as a storeman, OS.</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> Are you a member of the National Defence Force?</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> Yes, I am a soldier in the South African National Defence Force.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> And then very lastly, do I understand you correct that the attack on the police was motivated by the fact that you wanted to obtain their firearms in order to arm the self-defence units?  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> Yes, is that correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> And the attack on Mr Xegetwane's house was sort of to send him a signal that he is not wanted in the community, because he was seen as being instrumental in the taxi war.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> I have got no further questions, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR WILLIAMS</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Brink, are there any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.  I understand before putting questions, I understand that one of the victims, that is Mr Xegetwane has in fact arrived and I will after I have put questions, if I could have a short break just to consult with him about one or two matters.  In fact, it may be convenient if that indulgence is granted me now, Mr Chairman, so I can talk to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Five minutes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Yes, I don't think I need more than five minutes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We will take a short adjournment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">PATRICK NDLUMBINI:</span> (Still under oath).</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR BRINK:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman, for that.  I won't keep you long, Mr Ndlumbini, but I just want to ask you one or two questions relating to the allegations made in your affidavit, which was annexed to your application.   I am referring, Mr Chairman, members of the Committee to page 9 of the bundle, towards the bottom. In fact, it is the last paragraph, but further down. You said</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a>"In the townships there was a taxi war raging and we suspected that the police were instigating the violence in order to sabotage negotiations progress, which were underway at that stage between the ANC and the NP-led government."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a>Now what gave rise to the suspicion that the police were instigating the violence, which undoubtedly occurred, why do you say the police were assisting these people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> One day in 1991, I don't remember the date  of that line, but I was walking in New Crossroads, near to the house of Comrade Roy Sondo. There was one guy who was guarding Comrade Roy.  So I meet him on the corner. He said no, there is a combi coming.  I said what combi? He said there is a combi, you will see, because he was hiding himself and then I was waiting for this combi, because at that time I wanted to see what is happening really.  But on that van there was a driver, a taxi driver was driving the combi, but there was no one in the combi when I look at the combi. But the combi is passing me, there are two people who were lying on their backs in the car.  There are two policemen in the van.  So I mean, I was telling the guy now that there are two policemen in the van, he must be careful because you said it is a taxi, I mean, taxi war, but now there are two people, two policemen in the - that's where I see the police were involved in this ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Was it a generally held perception amongst your people that the police were instigating this violence? Did everyone believe that or was it just you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> Well, I think only people there, I mean not all. Some people, they knew that, especially my organisation knew that the police are very involved, and other people, they are also complaining that these police are there, who are busy ... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Now you told the Committee that your intention was to disarm the police.  And obviously, to disarm the police you would have to use force.</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> I didn't hear you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> Use force.</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Yes. In order to disarm the police, to take their weapons from them, you and your comrades would have to use force to do that, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> Yes, we have got to use.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Yes, and that, the force which you used, could easily have given rise to the policeman's death.  Do you understand me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> Yes, I understand you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> And you agree with me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> Yes, I agree with you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Now as I indicated to the Committee, Mr Xegetwane is here and he has told me that he does not oppose your application for amnesty but he has asked me to ask you a few questions. I want to show you a photograph which Mr Chairman, I have marked Exhibit A. Unfortunately it is only one, it was given to me by the victim concerned.  Just give that to the applicant, please. Just have a look at that photograph, Exhibit A. That photograph depicts, I am told, the remains of Mr Xegetwane's house.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> I think you must answer a little more loudly, it must be on record. Is that the remains of his house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> I don't know about this picture, but I see it is a front of the house of Mr Xegetwane.</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Could you please speak up?  Could you please speak up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> I see that is the front of Mr Xegetwane.  But maybe this happened after this attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Well, did you have anything to do yourself, with the destruction of his house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> Destruction of his house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Did you cause that damage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> This damage? No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> You didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Could we have a look at the picture before you continue your cross-examination, so we can understand what sort of damage you are talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Very well, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mr Chairman.  Just give the photograph for a moment.  To go back then, Mr Ndlumbini, did you have anything to do with the destruction of Mr Xegetwane's house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> No, I think what I was involved in, is only that attack. I don't know about this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Did you leave the house immediately after you had shot at it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> Yes, we leave the house immediately.</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Did you have anything to do with the theft of any of his cattle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> No, no, I mean, I mean, me ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> You, personally, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> I mean, our organisation, we don't take other things, I mean, it is undisciplined, you see. That's all I can say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Do you know anything about his cattle having been stolen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> I think I was already in prison that time, I was in prison when it happened. So I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> But in any event you haven't been charged with theft of cattle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> I'm sorry?</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> You haven't been charged with the theft of cattle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> No, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Stock theft.</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> I have one other questions I must put to you.  Are you aware that as a result of the noise caused by the shooting that night, Mr Xegetwane's daughter has been rendered death, she can't hear?</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> Well, I don't know about that, but as I said, first that it was no, it was not our aim to injure anyone in the house. Our aim was just to alarm the person to move out of the township.  Our aim was not to kill anyone, injure anyone.  As the whole organisation stand for that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Well, one last question.  You said it was not your aim to injure or kill anyone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> But when Judge Wilson questioned you earlier, you agreed that the firearms which had been used, could have had the effect of causing serious damage to the inhabitants of the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> I have certain reservations now, having read the statement again.  I mean, what sort of R4 was it, that this man had? I thought you said an R4 rifle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> The applicant on page 10 ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> (Indistinct - microphone not switched on).</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He said in his evidence that his companion had a rifle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> An R4, I thought he said an R4 rifle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Yes, that also appears, Mr Chairman, on page 10 of the papers, about halfway down the first paragraph</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a>"Four of us were armed and one person unarmed.  I was armed with an R4 rifle."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Yes, that is on another (indistinct). What weapons did your comrades have when you attacked Mr Xegetwane's house?  Was it a ,32 revolver?</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> An R4 rifle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> And a shot-gun.</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> No, the hand-gun, not shot-gun.</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> So there was no shot-gun?</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> It was an R4 rifle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> And a hand-gun.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Yes.  An R4 is, my recollection, is a rifle, that is not a shot-gun, is it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> Yes, it is a rifle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> I have no further questions, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR BRINK</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Any re-examination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">RE-EXAMINATION BY MR WILLIAMS:</span> If I can just clear one  point.  On the attack of Mr Xegetwane's house, how many people were armed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> If I still remember, it was the R4 and the other people they were armed, but the only guns we shot ourselves is two guns.</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> Ja, and that is?</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> ,32 and R4.</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> And is it correct that you had the ,32 hand-gun?</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> Yes, ,32 hand-gun, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> Someone else had the R4.</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> Yes, somebody else.</p>

<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> You have just said it was an R4 rifle. Will  you please be careful about your evidence.  What was it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> Yes, it is a R4 and a ,32 hand-gun,  yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> And what was the R4?</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is the R4, is it a rifle or is it a shot-gun?</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> The R4 is the rifle gun.</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> That is all, sir.</p>

<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> Everything was standing, even here, there was a bungalows, I think he also sell the bungalows. But there were the bungalows here and all, everything was all right that time. I am surprised to see this.</p>

<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> I'm sorry, I want to ask one last question. Do you know that it was the policy of the ANC at this time to try to bring peace to the community by establishing self-defence units with members of the community?</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> Yes, as I - I am from Tanzania, so Comrade Hani he arrived there in Tanzania to brief us about this, that they are going to form - the organisation will form the self-defence unit because the people are going inside the country, and then in South Africa, they don't allow us to come with our equipment.  So they are going to form the self-defence units. So I was aware that the ANC is going to form this self-defence units.</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> And they were to be in the communities?</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> Yes, they would be in the communities, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> It was, Mr Ndlumbini, part of politicising the masses with a view of intensifying the people's war, which the ANC was waging then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> Yes, it was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Very well, thank you very much.  You may stand down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> Judge Wilson, the applicant does not intend calling any witnesses on  his behalf.</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Brink, are you proposing to call any witnesses?</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> I think as Mr Xegetwane is here, and I think he would like to say something, if he could be sworn in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Xegetwane, are you wishing to make a statement to this Committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">MR XEGETWANE:</span> I am not prepared to make any statement.  I just want to thank the person who appeared here, who was actually behind all this that happened to my house. I just wanted to ask a few questions to Mr Patrick Ndlumbini, what was the reason behind. I have nothing more and I have peace because he is my brother.  That's all.  Can I pose a few questions to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Will you recall the applicant, please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> I will do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You are being asked to come in, because Mr Xegetwane wishes to put some questions to you.  Do you understand?</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, Mr Xegetwane, you may put your questions to the applicant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MR XEGETWANE:</span> Mr Patrick, it is the first time that I see you today. I am happy to see you there and I have peace in my heart and everything that has been said here, just because you are my brother, I have forgiven you.  But I want to know, what was the reason that you even go to such an extent of burning my house and you even injured my children, because of the type of the rifles that you used in shooting. What was the reason?</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> Mr Xegetwane, Comrade Xegetwane, I am going to try to answer the question like this.  While the people were burning your house I was not present. I am going to talk about the attack, while using the R4 and the other hand-gun.  As we had already heard, that there was this taxi violence in the communities,  what used to happen was this.  We realised that there was another organisation that was an opponent of the ANC.  Therefore we realised that you were the person in the forefront of this opponent organisation.  You are among the people who were perpetrating violence in our communities.  That was the reason we came to that decision that we must remove your from our community. That was, the aim was to show you that you are not needed in our communities.  Killing was not our aim.   Because this was a common action, it was something that used to happen in other places to show the people that are not wanted in the communities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLUMBINI:</span> What do you think and say about the expenses? I lost 26 000. My house was burnt down to ashes and one of my children is deaf.</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The question of the loss that you have suffered is something that this witness (indistinct). So there is no point in putting that question to him.  Do you understand?  Are there any other questions you wish to put to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MR XEGETWANE:</span> Thank you very much.  This is the last question.  I am happy to see you here.  The battle is over. I wish that this court can forgive you. Thank you very much. I am also happy to see you because I never knew you before. It is my very first time to see you here. It is obvious that I was looking for a person that I don't even know.  Can you please come and shake hands with me, if the battle is over, because the battle is over.  Thank you.  Can I go back to my seat now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, you may do so.  You are also excused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a>APPLICANT EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> I don't propose calling any witnesses other than Mr Xegetwane.</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Williams, we do not wish to hear any argument from you.  Mr Brink, is there anything you wish to say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> No, no, I think the applicant has made out a case, with respect, for the grant of amnesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Mr Brink, I was lucky enough last week, sitting in Bloemfontein, to have counsel appearing before us who somehow had a surplus of the recent submissions of the ANC.  I don't know if you have had an opportunity of seeing them yet, but it does appear that this applicant, what this applicant has told us, slots very much in to the submissions made by the ANC, set out in their further submissions, dated the 12th of May.</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Yes, I haven't had an opportunity of reading them, I haven't been supplied with a copy. I would like to get a copy, I probably will. In the light of your remarks, I appreciate the Committee is extremely busy. This matter does assume some urgency in view of the fact that the applicant has to go back to court, in July.  I merely mention that because it would seem an incredible waste of time and money for him to be - for the trial to continue and possibly to go to prison on his plea of guilty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> As I understand the situation correctly, that as far as he is concerned, he only has to go back to court in respect of the application, the first application and not the second one, that is the damage to Mr Xegetwane's house. That is not the charge against him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> That is not the charge against him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> There is a charge of attempted murder, isn't there? In respect of Mr Xegetwane, page 14 of the papers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> Judge Wilson, that attack relates to the evidence which applicant gave here, it relates to the firearm attack on Mr Xegetwane's house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> So he is facing two charges not just one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> The charges he face relates to Mr Xegetwane's and the policeman.  Those are the only charges.</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And what happened to the trial? I thought you said he pleaded guilty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> He pleaded guilty to the one charge relating to the policeman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  And has he been found guilty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> He has been convicted in respect of that and I refer to his plea of guilty which I annexed in the papers. It is in the file.</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And in respect of the second offence, was he found guilty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MR XEGETWANE:</span> He has not yet been found guilty in respect of the second offence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He has not yet been found guilty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So the trial has not concluded?</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> The trial is not concluded.</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Oh?</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> Can I just explain the reason for that, is that the victim in the second, or the complainant in the second matter, has never been to court, despite the fact that the prosecutor allege that he has been subpoenaed on several occasions. And the Court granted a final indictment to enable to the prosecutor to see if he can't find the complainant in that matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I understand.  Thank you very much.  Mr Brink, will this be a convenient stage to take the adjournment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Yes, yes, it would.</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You are ready with the next matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> I would like a few minutes. I haven't met the attorney appearing in the next matter and just to see if everything is all right and bring him through, and possibly we could have a 15 minutes adjournment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Very well, we will take a short adjournment at this stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
