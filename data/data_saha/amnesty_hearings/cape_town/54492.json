As Co-ordinator for Region 2 he was responsible for carrying out the operation.  There were South African and Mozambique operatives, both conscious and unconscious, in the three teams of six each that infiltrated Mozambique through the Namacha border post between Swaziland and Mozambique.  They used false passports and cars with false registration papers and number plates.  To maintain security, none of the teams knew each other or why they were doing the work.  Botes was in Swaziland to monitor the whole operation, using a phone box to communicate with his men in the field.\"\nThen he details, that's Pauw, what the routine was that was used and how the plan was devised and he quotes Botes, who says the following:\n\"Sachs had been on our assassination list for a long time and we did extensive surveillance on him.  We knew exactly where he lived and worked, who he mixed with and what his movements were.  I knew that it would be easy to blow him up.  I chose a highly intelligent and very dangerous black member of the CCB to plant the bomb.\"\nMaybe you can just read for yourself onto the following page up to the end of that paragraph.
