<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">JOHANNES GODFREY RAATH::</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR VISSER:</span> The application of this applicant appears in volume 1 from page 23 Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Raath you are an applicant applying for amnesty for any criminal or legal deed which was committed by you regarding the incident where Mr Kondile was killed, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That's correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> In your application on page 23 paragraph 7A and B, you replied "not applicable, and not applicable" to questions as to whether you were, amongst others, a member of a political organisation, institution or body, and if so in what capacity, that information you say to me is wrong.  Paragraph 7A which are the correct facts that we can say there?  Were  you a member of any political organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman I must tell you, and you will find this with many, many applicants the question here has been put, it's very unclear and it seems to be directed at officials of a particular organisation.  Certainly that is the way my attorney read it, he tells me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What about the word "lid"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> "Lid", well I've just asked this witness and he says he wasn't a "lid".</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Was a supporter, the following word?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Were you a supporter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> Yes I was a supporter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Of which party?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> Of the National Party.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I would ask Mr Chairman, I would move Mr Chairman for an amendment of the application in that regard.  7A should read "National Party" - "supporter" and 7B should read "National Party".</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> (...indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Chairman is it correct that on the 21st of January 1968 you became a member of the South African Police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And that from the 22nd of January 1968 up to and including December 1973 you were at the Uniform Branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And is it also correct that from 1973 to 1975 you were a detective?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And from '75 you became involved in the Security Branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Is it also so that from January '89 you were transferred to the Eastern Cape, Port Elizabeth where you lived?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you say '89?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> 1980 Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> 1980?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  He arrived here one month after Gerrit Erasmus Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And that you lived in Port Elizabeth until January '82 when you were transferred to Natal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And that you lived in Natal until December 1989?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thereafter from January 1990 till December '92 you were stationed in Bloemfontein in the Free State?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And thereafter till the 30th of March 1997 you were in Port Shepstone, in the stabilising unit, the unrest unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And on the 30th of March '97 you left the services of the South African Police Force?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> With which rank?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> Inspector.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Where were you born and where did you grow up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I was born in Pretoria and I grew up there till I was five years old and then we moved to the Eastern Transvaal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Very briefly what was the background of your education milieu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I grew up in a very conservative Afrikaans household and my parents were supporters of the National party and this is how I grew up.  We were also member of the NG Church.  My parents were supporters of the National Party's policy of apartheid, we believed in that.  Apart from opposition speeches and press there were very few things that made me think that I was wrong in this respect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And when you were a policeman you took an oath of trust in the government?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And as security policemen did you have anything to do with internal security?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That's correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You heard the testimony of du Plessis, van Rensburg and Erasmus, especially Erasmus regarding the matters regarding the unrest situation in Port Elizabeth in the years '80 and '81, was it also your experience regarding the situation there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> How would you have described the situation, how would you describe it today if you had to tell it in one sentence, how were things during those years, the situation in Port Elizabeth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I regarded it as something that had got out of hand.  The conditions in and around Port Elizabeth was that the security situation was out of control.  There were problems with the fact that the normal, the ordinary policeman could not do his duties effectively.  Policemen were a constant target for attacks....(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Just a bit slower please.  You say that the policemen were a constant target for attacks and murder?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> Yes.  This resulted in the fact that law and order could not be maintained and applied properly.  The result of this was a tremendous increase in normal, ordinary crime, together with a low success rate of court-orientated actions.  There was an inability to protect human lives and property.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> We've already learnt from Mr Erasmus that the role players or some of the big role players here like students and scholars and the workers, they were the biggest component?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> To save time he also referred to resistance actions which took place there and in general he informed the Committee regarding consumer boycotts, the burning of beer halls and large-scale intimidation, was that also your experience?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You confirm Mr Erasmus and du Plessis and van Rensburg's testimony in this regard, regarding the general circumstances.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a>	Now if we can go direct to Mr Sizwe Kondile's matter.  I want you, as far as you can remember, and if you can't remember certain aspects from memory just tell me, please tell us what exactly you had to do with Mr Kondile?  I am sorry, first I want to ask what was your rank in 1981?</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I was a sergeant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> So you were functioning on grassroots level?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I was involved in Kondile's interrogation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Raath I think I have to lead you in this regard.  Mr Kondile was detained in the Free State, you know that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Do you know how he landed in the Eastern Cape then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I received an instruction from Captain du Plessis to fetch Kondile and to transport him to Port Elizabeth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And you executed this command?</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Where did you place Kondile or what happened to him after you had brought him from Bloemfontein?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I took him to the police cells in Humansdorp where I detained him, and I reported that to Captain du Plessis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> If I might ask Mr Raath, who accompanied you to Bloemfontein?</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I was accompanied by Capt Greyling who also worked in Port Elizabeth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Was Mr Danster with you when you went to fetch Sizwe Kondile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> After I detained him I informed Capt du Plessis that he was being detained at Humansdorp.   Later Sizwe Kondile was transferred to Jeffrey's Bay where the interrogation continued.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a>	I was at all times in contact with du Plessis.  Sometimes we jointly interrogated him, sometimes I was alone, he was alone.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Here is a person by the name of Danster who made an affidavit, do you know this person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> Yes I know him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Where was this person stationed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> During this time relevant to Mr Kondile's detention at Jeffrey's Bay he was working at the same security branch in Port Elizabeth as I.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Danster, according to your knowledge, did he interrogate Mr Kondile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And according to what you can remember, when did Mr Danster, for the first time, have anything to do with Mr Kondile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> It was after I had received an instruction from du Plessis that Kondile should be detained in the barracks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That is what has been referred to as the white single quarters?</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Then Mr Danster was brought to assist you so that there would always be one person with Mr Kondile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Raath did you ever assault Mr Kondile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And if you had done that are you aware that you could apply for amnesty for that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you ever see Mr Danster assaulting Mr Kondile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> In any case you were busy saying that you also participated in Mr Kondile's interrogation, what else do you want to add to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I can just mention that during the time of his detention Kondile conveyed certain information to us, he identified certain things.  One important identification was in Transkei.  We took him there and he identified two people working in a bank and if I can remember now they were his contact persons who during the smuggling of explosives ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman forgive me for asking you but would you switch off your microphone please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Oh I am so sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you.  Well it wasn't you that was making the noise, I think it's my witness that is making the noise.  Please don't touch the microphone please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a>	Can you remember who those persons were who were identified by Kondile in Transkei regarding the smuggling of explosives?</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I can't remember their names now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> But there was an attempt to arrest them but they got away we've heard that evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Regarding you, what was Mr Kondile's status, did he belong to any organisation according to your information?</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> Yes during my interrogation of Kondile it was evident that he was a trained terrorist.   And also a courier between Lesotho, Transkei and the Republic.  And that he was trusted by Chris Hani.  He was an MK commander.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And would you say that Mr Kondile was also, besides being a confidante of Chris Hani also a member of the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> Sizwe Kondile was also, besides being a confidante of Chris Hani, also a member of the ANC, he was a trained terrorist.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Is it correct to say that you became aware that Mr du Plessis was busy to recruit Mr Kondile as an informer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> Yes, that is what he told me, that he was busy to have long discussions with Kondile and to recruit him as an informer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> From that moment what was your contact with Mr Kondile afterwards?</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> After du Plessis had told me that he was recruiting him as an informer I withdrew.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Why did you do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> It was the general practice at the security branch that you do not interfere with somebody else's informer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> An informer has either one or two handlers, you were not one of them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You also became aware that something had gone wrong with the deployment of Mr Kondile as an informer.  What was mentioned to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> Capt du Plessis approached me and told me that he found that Kondile was smuggling information from the cells to the ANC.  He did not provide any details.  That created a large problem because certain sensitive information regarding informers and information channels were conveyed to Kondile.  Because of this sensitivity of this matter it was decided that Kondile had to be eliminated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> In any case afterwards is it correct to say that Mr du Plessis spoke to you again regarding Mr Kondile, and here I refer to the instance when Kondile was already being detained in the white single quarters?</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What occurred during that discussion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That was during the stage when he was in the single quarters, he told me or instructed me and Danster, after he had told me that information was being leaked and that would harm his intelligence network and he said that that person had to be detained there.  Nobody should have access to him and I should see that no information would leak from that quarter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I just want to interrupt.  You later met Dirk Coetzee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> As far as you know was he at any stage in contact with Mr Kondile while he was being detained in the single quarters?</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Afterwards Mr du Plessis approached you again ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Mr Visser I am not sure, but is the evidence that he was in the room with him or that he just passed by.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Commissioner as we understand Coetzee's evidence, his provided evidence, he said that he and Nick van Rensburg went to the police cells in Jeffrey's Bay and he gave evidence that he and van Rensburg walked down a passage and there in one room he found two people.  One was a black security officer ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Yes I know he went down the passage, I just think he passed by the door and I ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think your question to this witness was not that, your question was did Dirk Coetzee have contact with Kondile, and he says no he didn't have contact.  It was never put that Dirk Coetzee had contact with Kondile.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you for pointing that out to me Mr Chairman, it's my mistake, I stand corrected and I appreciate it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a>	Mr Raath while you were busy with Mr Kondile to guard him according to instructions, did you ever see Mr Dirk Coetzee with Mr Kondile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a>	Now Mr du Plessis talked to you again and what did he tell you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> Capt du Plessis gave an instruction in the form of a request.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> He said he requested you to assist him.  He also afforded you the opportunity to consider the matter and a day or two afterwards you came back to him and said that you are prepared to help him.  You just said that you regarded that as an instruction rather than a request?</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And exactly what did Mr du Plessis tell you?  Did he tell you that they had decided at a higher level that Mr Kondile had to be eliminated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And what was the reason why you had to accompany them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> The reason was that I had to drive the vehicle with Kondile in from Bloemfontein on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Let's be honest Mr Raath, can you remember the dates when those things took place from memory?</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> It's very difficult from memory.</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> So we leave the dates aside.  On a specific day is it correct that you left with other people to Bloemfontein?</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That is correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Who were the other people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> We travelled with Nick van Rensburg, Colonel du Plessis, the deceased Kondile and I myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And with whose vehicle did you travel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> If I remember well it was Capt du Plessis' vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You left from Port Elizabeth, can you remember at what time of the day it was?  Was it during the morning or the afternoon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> If I remember correctly it was early in the afternoon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And then eventually you arrived in Bloemfontein.</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Was it light or was it dark?</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> It was already late in the evening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What happened in Bloemfontein?</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> We went to a certain place I can't remember.  All I know was the vehicle was handed to me, that was Kondile's car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Can you remember what type of car it was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> It was a light coloured Datsun.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That was handed to you there, do you remember by whom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> It could have been by Capt du Plessis or van Rensburg, one of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And did you then leave Bloemfontein at one or other time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You are saying it's late in the evening and you were driving, who was in which vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> Capt du Plessis, Colonel Nick van Rensburg and Kondile travelled in du Plessis' car and I drove Kondile's vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Who was in front and who was behind?</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> They were in front and I followed them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you travel fast?</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> No we could not because the vehicle was not in a good condition.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Whose vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> The Datsun was not in a good condition.</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> To cut a long story short, it was the next day the morning or that afternoon - first I want to say that.  O your way, you were travelling from Bloemfontein to where?</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> We were on our way to Komatipoort.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> On your way to Komatipoort did you do anything to that Datsun vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> Yes, near the border, I accept it's the Swaziland border there was a notice saying "Barberton".  I got instructions from van Rensburg to park the vehicle along the road and to leave it there with the keys in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And what did you do then after you had parked it there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I then got into the other vehicle and drove further with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Then you came to Komatipoort and what time of the day was that, was it the morning or the afternoon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I think it was late in the afternoon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And I think it can be said it's common cause that Mr Dirk Coetzee was there, you met him there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Was there anybody with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> Yes there was somebody with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Can you tell us today who that person was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> Your Honour I have met that man there for the first time in my life.  I have forgotten his name, but later on I established that it was Roy Otto.</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Can you describe him for us as you remembered him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I can vaguely remember that he was a short, stockish man, he had a bald head.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You met Mr Coetzee and that person to whom we will refer to as Mr Otto, for the purposes of your evidence, and what happened then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> From there I drove with du Plessis, van Rensburg and Kondile in the same vehicle and we followed Otto and Coetzee in their vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Was there anybody else, any other policeman there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And once again, to cut a long story short, you drove into the bush and there you parked the vehicles and got out. What did you do then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> Well we got out of the vehicles and I saw that some wood had been gathered and at that stage I was extremely hungry and I gathered some more wood where we lit a fire and we prepared some food.</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Kondile, was he given any food?</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And what happened in the meantime to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> After we got out of the car he was sitting against a tree trunk and his hands were cuffed.  We gave him food to eat.  While we were standing around the fire Mr Coetzee offered him a drink or something.</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What happened afterwards?</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I noticed that Kondile slowly fell to one side and I suspected then that he perhaps felt sleepy.  I did not realise precisely what was going to happen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you hear later on that it was alleged that sleeping drugs, or drops were put into his drink, you were not aware of it then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What happened then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> The next moment somebody said this matter must be concluded now and then suddenly this person, this Roy Otto walked up to Kondile, he drew his pistol and a shot rang out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> One or more.</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I only heard one shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did that shot kill Mr Kondile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> It's history now and I understand, I am not going into that in detail, but Mr Kondile's body was burnt to ashes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And then eventually you returned to Port Elizabeth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And is that the sum total of your participation in this unhappy incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman would you bear with me a moment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a>	Mr Raath I've previously referred you to Mr Danster.  Mr Danter's statement is found in volume 1.  Yes thank you Mr Chairman but more specifically at page 49 the second paragraph.  This Mr Danster in his statement submitted - and that is at page 48 I believe Mr Chairman, that he would accompany these people with you, that he would accompany you with Kondile, that it had happened on a Friday and that you would spend the weekend somewhere.  Do you know anything about this, or whether Mr Danster was ever asked to accompany you on that occasion where you went to eliminate him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> It was not put in cross-examination either.  I continue to page 49 where Mr Danster says that when you returned you, Mr Raath, bragged about the fact that you had taught Mr Kondile a lesson.  And then he asked you what kind of lesson you are referring.  He said that you then said his brains were blown apart.  And then he drew the inference that Kondile had been eliminated.  What are you saying about Mr Danster's version?</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I deny that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Is there any sense in informing him about Mr Kondile's elimination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> No it's not something to brag about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> But if I might ask Mr Raath, you were there "he was shot in the head", am I wrong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I can't say whether he was hit in his head, I did not see where the bullet penetrated.  I only saw him falling.  I was shocked, I did not know what to expect at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> My recollection is that the evidence was he was either shot through the ear or through the head, there wasn't any real certainty.  Now whichever portion of the head, be it the ear or the head, unless I have a very over-imaginative, whatever, his brain would spat.  Now I am simply trying to ascertain your observation and relate it to what is written in this particular affidavit that your counsel is referring to, this particular sentence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> Yes, his brains - I did not actually see his brains being blown apart and there is also no physical evidence that his brains were blown apart.</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> But while you accompanied Mr Kondile did he seem like somebody who was abnormally injured or anything like that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Let me put it straight.  Did it appear as if he was a person who had the same serious brain injury leading to brain damage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What are the consequences of this incident Mr Raath, what consequences did it have for you and your family?</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> This is something which happened to me in my life and I and my family are suffering because of this.  I am very sorry about this, and I will have to carry this burden for the rest of my life.</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> When you were given the instruction by means of du Plessis' request and you said yes, why did you say "yes you would follow instructions" what was the reason, what was the background?  Why did you execute this instruction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> In the first place where I was working from the morning till the night this unrest and violent situations, what I saw there where I was working as a security policeman on grassroots level and suddenly all things just overwhelmed you.  You can't describe to anybody what type of life you led.  To see schools burning every day.  You send this way, you send that way.  There are trained people who are infiltrating over the borders, they are bringing explosives, ammunitions.  There were bomb attacks, and from my point of view there was absolutely chaos during those time.  This person was definitely identified through interrogation as a trained terrorist, a courier who also assisted in smuggling weapons and explosives and ammunition into the country.  He was working for the ANC in Lesotho.  I can go on and on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a>	Taking all these things into consideration it just felt for me that I had to serve the government of the day.  As a policeman I had to do this and I had to assist in maintaining and enforcing law and order and to prevent the unrest situation as far as possible, and I felt this is why I said yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman I notice it is precisely one o'clock.  I don't know if you wish to take the luncheon adjournment now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a>HEARING ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">JOHANNES GODFREY RAATH:</span> (s.u.o.)</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR VISSER:</span> (cont)</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a>	Thank you Mr Chairman.  Just to round off Mr Raath, in your written application you have referred to certain political objectives and I am referring to volume 1, page 25, 26 and 27, do you confirm that?  You don't have it in front of you.  It's paragraph 10, A and B, page 25 to 27.</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And in paragraph 10 on page 27 you have requested the honourable Commission to the Foundation for Equality before the Law and also van der Merwe's submission, to incorporate that into this application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a>	Mr Raath if you want to summarise, what were your political motives when this instruction regarding Mr Kondile was executed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> Your Honour my primary task was that I had sworn allegiance to the State.  I did not do it for my own personal gain, but I acted as a policeman against the liberation movement.  I felt that that what I had done, seen against the background of the unrest situation in the area and in the country was something which was associated with my duties as a policeman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a>	My political convictions, I acted in terms of my powers as a member of the South African Police to combat the terrorists and people from the liberation movement.  My activities were in the interest of the country to maintain the government of the day.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> After a struggle had been concluded, it doesn't matter where, it's only the people who are the victims.</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> How do you feel today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> This was a struggle in which we were involved and I am very sorry for the losses on both sides.</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman that is the evidence, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR VISSER</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a>NO CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR BOOYENS</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MOOSA:</span> Mr Raath, exactly who was involved in the interrogation of Mr Kondile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> It was I and Captain du Plessis.  He was also interrogated at a stage by member of our East London security branch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> But with regard to interrogations by the Eastern Cape Security branch it was only you and Mr du Plessis, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That is correct, as far as I know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> In your application on page 24 Mr Chairman, in your answer to paragraph 9, subsection A(iv) you say that you associate yourself with the statement of Mr du Plessis, in fact you make no statement of your own there, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> 9(A)(iv).</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I want to refer you to the corresponding paragraph of Mr du Plessis' affidavit which appears on page 14 of the first bundle, and in particular to the last sentence of the second paragraph thereof, have you found that?  That begins - "since his detention..." etc.  Can you read that sentence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That is correct.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a>"Since his detention in the Eastern Cape he was interrogated by myself, members of my personnel as well as members of the Border Security Branch".</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> I want you to focus on "members of my personnel", it's members in plural and the only member you are referring to is yourself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That is correct.  I think what he meant there is that Danster was also involved but he was not intensively involved in the interrogation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> To what extent would he have been involved in interrogating?</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> He was only involved in the guarding of Kondile.</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> Not interrogating?</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> So in fact that's not an application in that Mr Danster was never involved in the interrogation of Mr Kondile, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> So how do you explain this which you have incorporated as part of your statement, what other members of Mr du Plessis' team are being here referred to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I do not know whether Captain du Plessis referred to the team that worked with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> Now that we are talking about Mr Danster, it's also stated by Mr Danster that he was amongst the people who went with you to fetch Mr Kondile from Bloemfontein.</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That is not true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> In fact the only person you have mentioned to us is a Capt Greyling, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That's correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> I take it then it was only the two of you and no one else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> Not the late Mr Buzane and definitely not Mr Danster?</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> Buzara?</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> No, Buzane.</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> Buzane, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> Could you tell us where this Capt Greyling is at the moment, where can we find him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I have no idea where he is stationed at the moment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> And you've said that you fetched Mr Kondile at the Security Branch in Bloemfontein, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> Who did you deal with in the security branch in Bloemfontein?</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I cannot remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> In what type of vehicle did you proceed from the Eastern Cape to Bloemfontein ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is there some doubt about all this?  If there isn't any doubt about it then what is the purpose of these questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> Mr Chairman it goes back to the question you asked me, which is, our version is that Mr Kondile was abducted from Lesotho.</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Put that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> I am leading up to something with the vehicle, it will become apparent in the next question.  What type of vehicle was used Mr Raath?</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> It was a sedan, it was Capt Greyling's official vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> So it was not a Datsun Laurel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> You are aware that Mr Danster has made a detailed statement, in fact it was put to you in evidence-in-chief, where he says amongst other things that you went to Bloemfontein and that there was discussion with Mr Kondile on the way back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> No, not at any stage did Danster travel to Bloemfontein with me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> Was there any discussion with Mr Kondile on the way back?</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> Yes I did speak to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> Could you tell us what that was about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> At that stage I did not have background, I asked him where he came from and I just spoke to him in general until we reached Port Elizabeth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> It is my instructions, as I have just mentioned to the Chairman, that Mr Kondile was abducted from Lesotho.</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That's unknown to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> Now Mr Danster has said in his statement that Mr Kondile was interrogated over a long period and was subjected to many assaults.</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I do not know anything about the assaults.</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> Could you describe the assaults you do concede to those, that is those by Mr du Plessis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I was not present when Capt du Plessis assaulted him.  I only heard this here at the trial.</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> You would agree with me that the arrest of Mr Kondile was a very important event, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> I would take it therefore that senior officers and other policemen would have come to Jeffrey's Bay to see the person who has been arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> All that I know of is that Capt du Plessis, I worked with him, that he was there.  I didn't see any other officers there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> One of the people that's mentioned by Mr Danster and is agreed to - sorry.  There is mention by Mr Danster of people who came from Pretoria, white policemen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I do not know about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> And Mr Coetzee has stated that it was himself who went with Mr van Rensburg at least past this place and certainly saw Mr Kondile at the white single quarters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I have no knowledge of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you know whether Mr Dirk Coetzee came there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> No I have no knowledge of that at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> When you fetched Mr Kondile in Bloemfontein do you know what happened to the vehicle which Mr Kondile had?</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> At that stage I did not have any knowledge of his vehicle.  I only had the instruction to fetch this man and to take him through to Port Elizabeth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> Mr Raath tell me, you and Mr Danster, were you working in a pair or could it possibly be that he was on duty when you were off at some time during that period of Mr Kondile's detention?</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I do not know which stage you are referring to now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> At the time (no interpretation).</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> U was daar ......</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> Also Mr Danster, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> Did you work together or were there occasions when you were off duty and he was on duty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> Yes, we were with him together most of the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> Do you know when there were occasions when he was alone?</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> Yes there were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Was he guarded day and night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> Yes.  We all slept there at night and he also slept in the room.  There was a bed for him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Yes, but you say there were three in the room?</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> At the time, was there a time when Danster was alone with Kondile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And where would you be then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I could have been in Port Elizabeth perhaps busy doing other work or I could even have gone home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes do carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> When Mr Kondile was interrogated was it always by you alone or were there times when you would join Mr du Plessis and you would do it together?</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> There were times that we sat together, there were times when I was alone, when he was alone during the interrogation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> And if Mr du Plessis was there to interrogate Mr Kondile would he also stay over at Jeffrey's Bay?</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> Not necessarily, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> Most Mr Kondile cooperative from the beginning as far as you were concerned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> As far as I was concerned from the time that I was involved in the operation he gave his cooperation and I had no problems with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> I am going to put it to you that it's in the highest degree unlikely that you would not have assaulted him and that the version given by Danster is very probable.</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> You say that Mr du Plessis told you about his decision to recruit Mr Kondile, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> And if I followed your evidence-in-chief properly, he also kept you informed of how that was going?</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> I would imagine you worked as a security policeman at that point on a need-to-know basis, or am I wrong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> With his recruitment Capt du Plessis did this on his own, I was present while he was doing the interrogation but he was alone with the man at times and in this way he recruited him and he worked with him on his own.</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> The recruitment occurred while Mr du Plessis was alone with Mr Kondile, is that what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> Yes, most of the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> Now why would Mr du Plessis come and tell you, a junior officer, about his progress with the recruitment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> He did not elaborate and give me details but I could realise that he was recruiting the man and that there was mutual trust.</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> Did he also tell you about the note he allegedly found on Mr Kondile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> It was mentioned to me but I was not told the details about the note.</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> When did you first meet Mr Coetzee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> It was at Komatipoort.</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> And Sergeant Otto?</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> At the same time, at Komatipoort.</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> You are telling us of course that Mr van Rensburg never visited, whenever you were present at least, at Jeffrey's Bay?</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> And the same applies to Mr Erasmus?</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> Now I am going to take you through from the Eastern Cape to Bloemfontein where supposedly Mr Kondile was released and then abducted or kidnapped.  When it's said that he was released does that mean that he was allowed to leave with his motor vehicle from the police station or did the whole transaction occur of him being kidnapped at the Bloemfontein station?</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Sorry.  I think the evidence was that he was released at Jeffrey's Bay, according to the papers at least, if it can be said he was ever released.</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> I stand corrected.  What actually happened, though, with the vehicle at Bloemfontein, with Mr Kondile's vehicle, did you fetch it immediately from the station and did you get him directly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> The vehicle was handed to me by Capt du Plessis or Colonel van Rensburg, I cannot remember which one of the two it was that gave me the keys of the vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> I am asking this question because Mrs Kondile has brought it to my attention that there seemed to be a number of reports at the time that Mr Kondile was led into his vehicle and was allowed to go, to be released, do you know anything about those?</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> At Komatipoort itself you say you found the wood already gathered, does that mean the wood was waiting for you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That is correct.  There was a pile of wood lying there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> And the area which you were in was a remote area, it was unlikely that onlookers would stumble onto what was happening there, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That's correct, yes.  It's a forestry area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> You have said that Sergeant Otto shot Mr Kondile and you heard the sound, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That's correct as far as I can remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> I take it then that a silencer was not used?</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That's correct, otherwise I would not have heard the shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> I put it to you that it's highly unlikely that a silencer would not be used to execute Mr Kondile.</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I cannot recall it very well but I cannot think that they used a silencer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> You say that you are unable to recall dates, tell me how you are able to recall the name of Sergeant Otto?</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I said that it was a person that I met at the scene and I later refreshed my memory, I remembered the name Roy Otto.</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> When you refreshed your memory was it with the aid of your co-applicants, that is Mr van Rensburg, Mr Erasmus and Mr du Plessis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That's correct.  I think I asked one of them whether they could recall who the man was.  I gave a description of the man to you and they, one of them, said that this was Mr Otto and the name rang a bell.</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> I take it that was the first time you met Mr Otto during this transaction in Komatipoort?</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> We have heard evidence about various meetings before statements were compiled, were you at any one of those meetings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> Did you read Mr du Plessis' statement before you signed yours?</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> You just went ahead and signed your statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> After I went to my legal representatives I compiled my statement and I signed it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> You have described in your evidence your background and what you thought about what you called terrorists, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> You have also told us though that you averted your eyes and tried not to see what was going on, and in fact that you were shocked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> I will put it to you that that is actually unlikely that you would do that.  You would more likely have enjoyed every moment of what you saw.</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That is completely untrue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> And that is why you would have gone back and bragged to Mr Danster and everyone else possibly how the man's brains were splattered.</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That is absolutely untrue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> At the end of your statement as also at the end of your evidence today you told us that you were doing what you did in the execution of your duties as a policeman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> Yes and I worked under instructions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> Well working under instructions or not what you did was totally unlawful and it's not what is supposed to be done by a policeman it's a criminal act.</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I understand that that it's illegal but I did this in the execution of my duties and I think that I have testified to this effect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> I put it to you that from the viewpoint of my clients there is no political motive whatsoever that will ever justify what you have done.</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> It was absolutely a political motivation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> And that even if there were any political motives you would have exceeded the bounds you were allowed to go to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I don't believe that I exceeded the bounds, I worked under instructions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> Finally it's our contention that you have not made full disclosure to this Committee but a part of a massive cover-up and the versions given by Mr Coetzee and Mr Danster are more probable.</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That is why I came here to tell the truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MOOSA</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR NYOKA:</span> Two minutes again Mr Chairman.  I will ask for amnesty if I go beyond.</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a>	Mr Raath when you went to fetch the vehicle of Mr Kondile from Bloemfontein were you not given any of those false documentations that he was alleged to have used in crossing into the country?  As now he was going to be detained as well in PE or Humansdorp.</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> No your Honour.</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYOKA:</span> What did he have in his possession when you were transporting him to the Eastern Cape?</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> If I remember correctly he had nothing with him, no suitcase, nothing, or any documentation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYOKA:</span> And you did not find any weapons or pamphlets in his possession?</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYOKA:</span> My instructions are that Mr Kondile was kidnapped from Lesotho, he did not cross as alleged, not by you by other policemen, hence you could not find anything with him, he had no clothing.  He was abducted.  Do you dispute that stance?</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> Your Honour I don't know anything about an abduction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYOKA:</span> Finally just in Volume 2, page 169 I would like you to turn to 169, Volume 2, there's a name on top, Phakamile Xlamile, this person was a close friend of mine, he skipped with Mr Kondile in 1980 and he has informed me to tell you that as now he's in the Easter Cape Provincial Government, Safety and Security, that Mr Kondile would never cross into the country with a vehicle. The two of them would infiltrate by swimming across the river as they had done before.  Mr Kondile will swim across the river with him, Mr Xlamile.</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well Mr Chairman what is the status of this question, on what is it based?  Is this man going to come and give evidence, is my learned friend giving the evidence, what is the status of this, with all due respect?</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> (...indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYOKA:</span> I am putting it to you the family waited for 16 years, I have got to put this.  This is not just a one week affair.  The family has been sitting on this for 16 years.  He has said that Mr Kondile infiltrated the country with him by swimming across, that he crossed with a vehicle is a figment of everybody's imagination, we are saying so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> Your Honour I can't comment on this.  I don't know anything about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS BY MR NYOKA</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> (?)   I don't know if Mr Jansen, Advocate Jansen ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You do it first.</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MARAIS:</span> Thanks Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a>	You got information from Mr Kondile is that correct, that's now you personally?</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> Yes that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> How did you succeed in doing this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> By interrogating him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> Is that all, did you just ask him to give you information and he gave you the information?</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> No it was not that easy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> Can you tell the Commission what you did, how you did it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> If there was a subject regarding which interrogation was done I asked him about.  And then he was questioned about that, depending on what the information was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> Now we know about the information regarding the people in the bank, you were also involved when that was obtained?</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> The information was merely obtained by methods of interrogation, there was no pressure exerted on him or anything else, is that what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> If it would have happened then you would have known about it, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> And he wasn't promised anything either?</p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> With his recruitment Capt du Plessis might have promised him something, I do not know what.  I don't know what he discussed with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> So you don't know at all what Captain du Plessis, what he interrogated him about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> He tasked him as an informer and from his interrogation and from mine we put the answers together and we reacted on that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> So was he interrogated on his own, then he would come back to you and say that he had obtained that information?</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> Yes our interrogation was bound in a bundle and we made notes.  We knew what had happened with each other's interrogation, we worked together as a team.</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> And he also obtained information just as you did?</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> Yes that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> And you don't know how he succeeded in getting the information from Kondile, which method he used or which pressure he exerted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> By interrogating him I don't know whether he promised him anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> But you personally didn't tell him if you give me the information then I can have these wonderful things happen to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> Do you think that it was practice that Mr du Plessis would have done something like that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I don't know, I cannot reply to that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> Are you saying you don't know what the practice of interrogation was during that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> Yes I know.   This man was in a stage of his recruitment as an informer and the recruitment process was dealt with by Capt du Plessis and this man gave information because he had already started cooperating and this information was followed up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> I understand that but what I am asking you is, did you know what the practice was, which means you used in order to obtain this information, because you surely would no just tell the man please give me the information and he'd say no thank you or thank you here's the information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> When he was recruited and he gave his cooperation then there was a reward.</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> So you knew that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> Yes I knew that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> But you didn't know whether Captain du Plessis offered him a reward?</p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> You yourself was it within your powers to offer him a reward?</p>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> Well if I had an informer that I had registered I could have gone to my superior and I could have received a reward to give to him for his cooperation if I felt that he deserved it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> And your evidence before the Commission is that it wasn't necessary for you personally to offer Kondile a reward to get the information that you did get?</p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> No it wasn't necessary for me to do so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> How long did you interrogate him before you became aware of the fact that Captain du Plessis was recruiting him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> The recruitment process started from the first day that he was being interrogated and this continued and the information also continued and we worked on this information as a team and I could see in which direction things were going.  He trusted Capt du Plessis and vice versa and with the recruitment I did not get involved personally.</p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> So from the interrogation on the first day you were aware of the fact that Capt du Plessis was recruiting this man?</p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> Yes it was clearly visible, this man cooperated from the start.</p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Could I just ask Mr Raath, did you also give Mr Kondile paper on which to write reports to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> No I never gave him any paper.</p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Did you ever receive written reports from him you know as part of his cooperation with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> No, notes which were made I made myself as he made things known to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> The room that you interrogated him in was it the same room that he used to sleep in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> At no stage did you find any paper on him, you personally?</p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> No, I personally never found anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Did you at any stage see him give a written report to Mr du Plessis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> No I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  At which stage did you withdraw from the interrogation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> If I can remember correctly it was after the identification in the Transkei and when I heard from Capt du Plessis that he had recruited the man and that he was his handler and that's when I did it, when I withdrew.</p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> After he was recruited was he recruited at the stage when he was already in Humansdorp?</p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I would say that the recruitment that it can require a lengthy period, but it had started there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> More specifically was he recruited at Humansdorp already?</p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> No in Jeffrey's Bay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> Were you present or were you assisting in the interrogation from the beginning to the end?</p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> And you are saying that what you saw from the first day that you could see that he was busy turning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> And that he gave his cooperation from the first day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> Capt du Plessis says at one stage it was necessary to hit him with his open hand and with his fists.</p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I never saw that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> And he found it necessary to do so in order to get his cooperation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That can be possible but I was not present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> And did Sizwe Kondile never say to you Capt du Plessis was here yesterday and what a clap, he made no comment to you at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> No he mentioned nothing to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> Thank you.  Did you get the impression when he was transferred to Jeffrey's Bay that things were going easier, that the recruitment had been finalised?  No before the recruitment was completed did you have the impression that things were going easier now, that things were coming to an end and that the recruitment will be completed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I can't say that things were nearing a certain point now, but at one stage he told me that the person had been recruited now.  I can't say at which stage.  It's not easy to pinpoint a specific stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> Could you get the impression from Mr Kondile himself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> Yes he cooperated closely with du Plessis, they often spent time together.  They sat talking there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> And when you interrogated him in Jeffrey's Bay was it easier for you too?</p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> Yes at that stage the identification had been done and I have completed my task.</p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> How long on average did you spend per day to interrogate him, or separately your joint attempts, either individually or jointly, how long was he interrogated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> It was usually normal office hours.</p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, I didn't catch the answer to the last question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> They spent the whole day interpreting him, normal office hours.</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> Do I have to repeat the question, did you hear that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> He was interrogated periodically.</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> And if I understand it correctly you interrogated him for almost a month, a little bit less than one month?</p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That is correct, yes.  Initially the interrogation was done and the information obtained and later on he was not integrated so much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> You see what I am wondering about is how much information did Kondile have that it had taken so long for him, considering the fact that he was cooperating that it had taken a month to give you the information he had, was it volumes full of information?</p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I would put it in this way.  The information I got and the follow-up work I did in Transkei I have completed my task.  Du Plessis testified according to what happened afterwards.</p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> What I am saying is now you don't want to answer this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That what I have interrogated him for took about two weeks and the follow-up and what du Plessis testified about I can't say.  Perhaps whether he's obtained bundles and bundles of information I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> But you would have known if there was bundles full of information and was there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> Yes there was, this information was presented here but I did not work with that.  I just worked on the information I obtained.  We went to Transkei, we identified some people and my tasks were completed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> If I understand you correctly there were bundles of documentation regarding information provided by Kondile to the Security police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> Those were things du Plessis handled.</p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think your question should really be coming to your client's commitment or involvement in the matter, the extent of his involvement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> Yes my questions are related to that, my client's version is that Kondile was tortured and it was difficult to get the information.  Now he is saying it is easy to obtain the information.  I want to ascertain how much information he had because it took a whole month.</p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a>	I will continue to the next point.  Mr Raath your evidence is that you were involved at Humansdorp and Jeffrey's Bay all the time except those times when du Plessis was there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That's what I testified yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> Mr Chairman you can stop me.  The impression I've got as far as I remember Mr du Plessis' evidence was that Mr Raath appeared on the scene at Jeffrey's Bay after the note had been found and he was sent there to guard Kondile.</p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a>Mr Raath you've heard what I've said.  Mr du Plessis' evidence was ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Your objection?</p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a><span class="speaker">ADV VISSER:</span> My objection is that my learned colleague is putting a question on a factual basis which doesn't exist.  Mr du Plessis was quite clear in his evidence that he and Raath interrogated this man.  Raath has told you that by the time that du Plessis told him that the man had become an informer, Raath then faded out of the picture. That is the evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> Mr Chairman is that the correct version that he put, I wasn't sure that's why I asked if...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line546"><a name="pos546"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That is part of the answer that was given by Mr du Plessis but I think it is common cause that Mr Raath was the man who went in the first instance to bring Kondile from Bloemfontein.</p>
<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a><span class="speaker">ADV VISSER:</span> Yes you're absolutely right Mr Chair, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line548"><a name="pos548"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> Mr Raath what was the practice - Let me rather put it in this way, if you have to fetch a trained terrorist from another station, how many people are sent to fetch him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> In our case we were two.  It's not necessary to send a whole truck load full of people.  They never sent more than two people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> Perhaps yes, it would have been safer, wouldn't you agree?  Don't you believe it would have been safer if more policemen went to fetch him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I did not see the necessity, there were things like handcuffs which could be used.</p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> Mr Chairman, just a minute please.  Your evidence is some identifications were done by Mr Kondile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That is correct yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> During these identifications who were involved, was it you, Mr Kondile and who else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> Captain du Plessis and also members from East London, I can't remember specifically who.</p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> Mr du Plessis specifically testified about an incident in King William's Town when he was not there, can you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> Yes I can mainly remember about a taxi rank which was indicated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> Who were there if he wasn't there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> There were members from East London who were there, I don't know who they were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> Were they senior officers or junior officers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I can't say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> Then the practice is that identification is done to a senior to an officer at least.</p>
<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> It depends on what kind of identification.</p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did Mr Danster have anything to do with all this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> No your Honour.</p>
<p class="line" id="line566"><a name="pos566"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> According to Mr Danster, you and Mr du Plessis were only involved when it came to the single quarters, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line568"><a name="pos568"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> Did Mr du Plessis still visit Kondile in the single quarters?</p>
<p class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> Yes regularly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line570"><a name="pos570"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> What happened there then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> They held discussions.  I was not involved in that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> What happened to you and Mr Danster when Mr du Plessis came there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I went to do something else or somebody was at least relieving me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> And how regularly did that happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I can't say it could have been every day or every second day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> That was during the stage when he was in the single quarters and I accept that he drove quite a way to get there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> Yes he came from Port Elizabeth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> So I assume that he would not just stay there for five minutes, he would spend some time there if he took the trouble to come all that way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> Sometimes he spent a short time there, sometimes he was on his way to do something else, that wasn't the only thing he had to do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> Mr du Plessis and Mr Kondile, did they also go out to do identifications?</p>
<p class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> We all went together during these identifications in Transkei.</p>
<p class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> It was already at that stage when he was placed in the single quarters?</p>
<p class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> No that happened before that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> When he was placed in the single quarters then Mr du Plessis and Kondile, did he go anywhere then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line585"><a name="pos585"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> No I can't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line586"><a name="pos586"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> Why I'm asking you that is Mr du Plessis had testified that after you had been placed in the single quarters, no interrogation took place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line588"><a name="pos588"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> And I find it strange, and I'm putting it to you, if no interrogation had taken place, what was he doing there every day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line589"><a name="pos589"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I've told you, no interrogation took place but they held discussions.  What they were talking about I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> Are you sure there was no interrogation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I'm sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> How do you know that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line593"><a name="pos593"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I said so because I was there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line594"><a name="pos594"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> So were you there when Capt du Plessis visited him in the single quarters and spoke to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> Yes I was there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line596"><a name="pos596"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> As I've heard your evidence, you and Mr Danster left when du Plessis came there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line597"><a name="pos597"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> We could have stayed in the room, we could have left the room.</p>
<p class="line" id="line598"><a name="pos598"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> I can understand that but you've earlier testified not that we could go outside, you said that we did go outside when du Plessis came there and that was the reason why you said you didn't what was happening between them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line599"><a name="pos599"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> This had happened seventeen years ago, I could  have made a mistake, but according to what I can remember, I could have gone out, I could have gone to the cafe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line600"><a name="pos600"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> I'm putting it to you that it's strange now that you're using the excuse of not knowing.   When I'm mentioning to you that you are contradicting Mr du Plessis's evidence, this is why you're using the excuse now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line601"><a name="pos601"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> As far as I know Captain du Plessis never visited him at the single quarters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line602"><a name="pos602"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> Are you sure?  But you've earlier said that he came there every second day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line603"><a name="pos603"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I said he did visit them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line604"><a name="pos604"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> What was Mr du Plessis instruction to you and Danster at the single quarter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line605"><a name="pos605"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> Mr du Plessis informed me and I've testified in this regard about the information which was smuggled from the cells and he would place Kondile in the single cells and we had to guard him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line606"><a name="pos606"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> Are you sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line607"><a name="pos607"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> Yes I'm sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line608"><a name="pos608"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> So he told you that Kondile wanted to smuggle information, to leak information and you must be sure that it doesn't happen.  That's strange because Mr du Plessis said that he never mentioned that to you, he just gave you a general instruction that you had to guard this person, see that nothing goes in, nothing goes out.  He didn't give a reason for that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line609"><a name="pos609"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> Mr du Plessis did give a reason.  He informed me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line610"><a name="pos610"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> So he must have made a mistake in his evidence.  But you are sure now that he had provided you with a reason.</p>
<p class="line" id="line611"><a name="pos611"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> He did give me a reason.</p>
<p class="line" id="line612"><a name="pos612"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> So if you are sure he perhaps is making a mistake.  Both can't be correct because it's two different things.</p>
<p class="line" id="line613"><a name="pos613"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can you just come over to the - you've got a very limited role to play in this matter here, I want you to understand that.  I wish you'd confine yourself to matters pertaining to your client please ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line614"><a name="pos614"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> Mr Chairman...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line615"><a name="pos615"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> There must be some limit to these proceedings as well, we can't carry on indefinitely you see.</p>
<p class="line" id="line616"><a name="pos616"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> Mr Chairman while you touch on the subject, may I be allowed to make a short submission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line617"><a name="pos617"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Please not, I want this witness to finish.</p>
<p class="line" id="line618"><a name="pos618"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line619"><a name="pos619"></a>	Did Mr Danster ever talk to Mr Kondile while he was guarding him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line620"><a name="pos620"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> As far as I can remember yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line621"><a name="pos621"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> There were no problems between Danster and Kondile to talk about social matters?</p>
<p class="line" id="line622"><a name="pos622"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> No not as far as I can remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line623"><a name="pos623"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> And between you and Mr Kondile? You spoke freely to one another.</p>
<p class="line" id="line624"><a name="pos624"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> Yes as far as I can remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line625"><a name="pos625"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> And you did?</p>
<p class="line" id="line626"><a name="pos626"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> Yes we did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line627"><a name="pos627"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> Did Kondile make any attempt as far as you could gather that he was trying to leak some information or smuggle information from single quarters?</p>
<p class="line" id="line628"><a name="pos628"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> Not that I know of.</p>
<p class="line" id="line629"><a name="pos629"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> And if I remember correctly your task was specifically to prevent that that should happen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line630"><a name="pos630"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That is correct yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line631"><a name="pos631"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> So your attention would have been focused on such possible attempts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line632"><a name="pos632"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That's possible yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line633"><a name="pos633"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> And you're telling the Commission that you can't remember that he tried to do something like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line634"><a name="pos634"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I can't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line635"><a name="pos635"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> And I'm putting it to you that it is improbable that you would not have tried.</p>
<p class="line" id="line636"><a name="pos636"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> He would not have done it openly so that you could see it because then it would not be smuggling.</p>
<p class="line" id="line637"><a name="pos637"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> I'll concede to that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line638"><a name="pos638"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> You and Mr Danster's relationship at that stage, were there any problems?</p>
<p class="line" id="line639"><a name="pos639"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line640"><a name="pos640"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> Were you only colleagues or were you also friends on a social level?</p>
<p class="line" id="line641"><a name="pos641"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> We were colleagues.</p>
<p class="line" id="line642"><a name="pos642"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> Did anything happen afterwards between the two of you that would have caused friction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line643"><a name="pos643"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> Nothing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line644"><a name="pos644"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> You can't think why Mr Danster is saying these things about you in his statement?  Do you know what is entailed in Mr Danster's statement?  You don't know why he's saying these things about you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line645"><a name="pos645"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> No I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line646"><a name="pos646"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> No further questions your Honour.</p>
<p class="line" id="line647"><a name="pos647"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(indistinct) would you rather do that when you're re-examining your witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line648"><a name="pos648"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> No I've - you stopped me Mr Chairman, I wanted to make a submission in regard to this cross-examination and this witness but that's now over and done with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line649"><a name="pos649"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line650"><a name="pos650"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I've got no re-examination your Worship.</p>
<p class="line" id="line651"><a name="pos651"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No well I, you may yes because I'm going to ask Mr Jansen if he has questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line652"><a name="pos652"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARAIS:</span> I'm sorry no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line653"><a name="pos653"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MARAIS</p>
<p class="line" id="line654"><a name="pos654"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Jansen do you have any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line655"><a name="pos655"></a>CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR JANSEN</p>
<p class="line" id="line656"><a name="pos656"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> Yes thank you Mr Chairman, I do.  Mr Raath you would agree that your application is more than cryptic.  You just confirm in total your co-applicant's applications.</p>
<p class="line" id="line657"><a name="pos657"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line658"><a name="pos658"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> Why did you not make an attempt to spontaneously give your own version?</p>
<p class="line" id="line659"><a name="pos659"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I've given my evidence for the purposes for which I am here and that is to come and tell the truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line660"><a name="pos660"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> But my submission to the Committee is that I have the impression that you all follow the one version till the end till you see which way things are going and so that you based all your applications on this one standpoint.</p>
<p class="line" id="line661"><a name="pos661"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I've just told you about what I know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line662"><a name="pos662"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> I just want to get certainty.  Did you yourself compile this statement, type it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line663"><a name="pos663"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> No it was done by my legal representatives.</p>
<p class="line" id="line664"><a name="pos664"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> And did they ask information from you, you conveyed the information to them and they worded it and formulated it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line665"><a name="pos665"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That is correct yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line666"><a name="pos666"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> Now the one thing I still find absent in all your evidence is that the detailed evidence regarding the interrogation about these bomb attacks, do you know whether he was interrogated about bomb attacks?</p>
<p class="line" id="line667"><a name="pos667"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> From my side I can't remember.  I can't, whether I've asked him anything about bomb attacks.  I was concentrating on the photo album and about identifications.</p>
<p class="line" id="line668"><a name="pos668"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> What was your specific function?</p>
<p class="line" id="line669"><a name="pos669"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I worked directly under du Plessis in black affairs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line670"><a name="pos670"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> You also know what Mr Coetzee's version is regarding the Audi 80 which was stolen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line671"><a name="pos671"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> Yes I've heard about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line672"><a name="pos672"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> You deny any knowledge of that incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line673"><a name="pos673"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I don't know anything about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line674"><a name="pos674"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> Mr Coetzee also said that amongst others, after the Audi had been stolen, you said that you wanted the tyres, you've read that version of his?</p>
<p class="line" id="line675"><a name="pos675"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> Yes but I don't know about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line676"><a name="pos676"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> Yes you're saying Mr Coetzee is lying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line677"><a name="pos677"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I don't know about the Audi, I don't know about the tyres.</p>
<p class="line" id="line678"><a name="pos678"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> Either Mr Coetzee is lying or he is confusing you with someone else?  One of the two, that must be your submission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line679"><a name="pos679"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I wouldn't know where he got this from.</p>
<p class="line" id="line680"><a name="pos680"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> Okay, could I just ask Mr Raath, I read somewhere here that you owned a Passat at the time, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line681"><a name="pos681"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That is correct yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line682"><a name="pos682"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> Now I don't know but would an Audi tyre fit a Passat tyre?</p>
<p class="line" id="line683"><a name="pos683"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> Not necessarily.</p>
<p class="line" id="line684"><a name="pos684"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> You wouldn't know, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line685"><a name="pos685"></a>	One other point, you also know Mr Coetzee's version regarding what happened at Komatipoort.</p>
<p class="line" id="line686"><a name="pos686"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That is correct yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line687"><a name="pos687"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> I don't want to explain it to you in detail because I know you've listened to your colleagues reacting to certain parts which have been submitted to them.  There is not any specific part of Mr Coetzee's evidence on which you want to comment apart from denying it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line688"><a name="pos688"></a><span class="speaker">ADV VISSER:</span> That's not a reasonable question, if my learned friend wants evidence which he wants to put to the witness he must do so.  He can't make a sweeping statement to say what do you disagree with Dirk Coetzee's evidence Mr Chairman.  This witness ...(indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line689"><a name="pos689"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(indistinct) he wants to comment on. Is there anything about Coetzee's evidence which you wish to comment?  Is that what you're trying to get?</p>
<p class="line" id="line690"><a name="pos690"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> Yes I accept Mr Chairman that it's not practice to place it in such a wide term but maybe I should just place the main events, the main moment's of Coetzee's version to this witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line691"><a name="pos691"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes do that please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line692"><a name="pos692"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> Right If you just want to comment on the following statements</p>
<p class="line" id="line693"><a name="pos693"></a>	Coetzee says that he did visit Jeffrey's Bay police station where he saw the detainee Mr Kondile.</p>
<p class="line" id="line694"><a name="pos694"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I did not see Coetzee there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line695"><a name="pos695"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> And Coetzee said that it was at the same stage you stole an Audi vehicle together with him, and Coetzee conceded that he was later murdered at Komatipoort, implicated other people like Fleming for example and he implicates a certain Deetlefs and Rorich, van Dyk but on the other hand he does not implicate Roy Otto.</p>
<p class="line" id="line696"><a name="pos696"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> These people he's referring to, I don't know them.  I've already said in my evidence who were there.  We were definitely not at the same party.</p>
<p class="line" id="line697"><a name="pos697"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> Please repeat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line698"><a name="pos698"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> We weren't all at the same place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line699"><a name="pos699"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> Did I hear your evidence correctly that Danster first came on the scene when Kondile was transferred to the single quarters?</p>
<p class="line" id="line700"><a name="pos700"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That is correct yes.  It could have been that Danster moved with me, perhaps visited the man in the cells but he was not involved in his interrogation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line701"><a name="pos701"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> It could have possible been that Kondile was was first detained in the cells in Jeffrey's Bay before he was transferred to the single quarters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line702"><a name="pos702"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That is correct yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line703"><a name="pos703"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> So did Danster's role entail anything else apart from guarding?</p>
<p class="line" id="line704"><a name="pos704"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> No he only guard Kondile.</p>
<p class="line" id="line705"><a name="pos705"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> Would he ever have taken him out for investigation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line706"><a name="pos706"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line707"><a name="pos707"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> Look on page 185.</p>
<p class="line" id="line708"><a name="pos708"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What volume are we talking about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line709"><a name="pos709"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> Volume 2 Mr Chairman, page 185.</p>
<p class="line" id="line710"><a name="pos710"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line711"><a name="pos711"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> Page 185, it's a cell register dated the 25.7.81.  The first entry right at the top and correct me if my quote is wrong, serial number 1444 and the 10H.50 and then it reads as follows</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line712"><a name="pos712"></a>"Investigations on -:, 'B M' which probably stands for 'Black Man' Bueinisizwe Kondile out of cells for investigation, escort by Sgt Danster" .</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line713"><a name="pos713"></a>Would you agree with what I'm reading there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line714"><a name="pos714"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> It is correct yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line715"><a name="pos715"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> This was on the 25th of July.</p>
<p class="line" id="line716"><a name="pos716"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line717"><a name="pos717"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> As I remember your evidence if I remember that correctly, Kondile was transferred from Humansdorp to Jeffrey's Bay on the 24th of July.</p>
<p class="line" id="line718"><a name="pos718"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That is correct yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line719"><a name="pos719"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> How do you explain then Danster's involvement in this investigation, one day after his arrival at Jeffrey's Bay?</p>
<p class="line" id="line720"><a name="pos720"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> It could possibly be that I sent him to the cells to take him out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line721"><a name="pos721"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> Yes anything can be possible.  Sorry Mr Chairman I'm not correct, there's just one more question that I do, it's not...(indistinct).  To detain Kondile in a the single quarters, is it correct that the cooperation of the station commander was required for that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line722"><a name="pos722"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I think yes it was cleared by Captain du Plessis and that was lieutenant Warrant Officer Jonker, I can't remember him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line723"><a name="pos723"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> Mr Chairman I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line724"><a name="pos724"></a>Sorry Mr Chairman if you could just bear with me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line725"><a name="pos725"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes certainly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line726"><a name="pos726"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> Yes sorry Mr Chairman there's just a last aspect that I want to refer this witness to.  Mr Raath can you please page to page 163 in volume 2.  It's an affidavit of a certain Edwin Mayepe. Have you seen this affidavit before?</p>
<p class="line" id="line727"><a name="pos727"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> It's the first time that I've seen this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line728"><a name="pos728"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> I'll just summarise it quickly.  It's an affidavit which is made in 1990 for purposes of the Harms Commission by this Mayepe who said that in '81 a second hand Audi 80 was stolen from him in Port Elizabeth.  It also confirms that he was involved at that stage with a legal officer of a trade union.  My question to you is can you think of any reason why Mr Coetzee would become involved in the theft of a vehicle or make up his own participation in this theft at the stage when he testified before the Harms Commission?</p>
<p class="line" id="line729"><a name="pos729"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I have no knowledge of that because I said that I did not even see Coetzee if he was in Port Elizabeth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line730"><a name="pos730"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Had you known or seen Coetzee by that time in 1981?</p>
<p class="line" id="line731"><a name="pos731"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> No I saw him for the first time at Komatipoort.</p>
<p class="line" id="line732"><a name="pos732"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So even if he was there, you may not have known who he was at Jeffrey's Bay, you wouldn't know who it was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line733"><a name="pos733"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line734"><a name="pos734"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Visser?</p>
<p class="line" id="line735"><a name="pos735"></a><span class="speaker">ADV VISSER:</span> I have no re-examination thank you Mr Chairman</p>
<p class="line" id="line736"><a name="pos736"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR JANSEN</p>
<p class="line" id="line737"><a name="pos737"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> I just want to point out to you this affidavit on page 163 says that the person bought the car in June of '81 and six or seven months later it was stolen.  That means approximately December or January '82. Can it then be that you know of a car that was stolen long after this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line738"><a name="pos738"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> No I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line739"><a name="pos739"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> Mr Raath, please tell me, the body of Mr Kondile was burned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line740"><a name="pos740"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That's correct.  He was shot while he was lying next to a tree, that's what I understood from the other witnesses, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line741"><a name="pos741"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> Was he shot or was he burned out next to the tree or was he carried and put on a pyre?</p>
<p class="line" id="line742"><a name="pos742"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> It was a little way from there, two or three steps, he was carried away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line743"><a name="pos743"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> Who carried him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line744"><a name="pos744"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I know that I helped to carry him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line745"><a name="pos745"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> Where on his body did you support him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line746"><a name="pos746"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I cannot remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line747"><a name="pos747"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> In any case you had an opportunity to look at this body.  Can you please tell us where this person had been shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line748"><a name="pos748"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I can't remember any more.  I did not look at that body it was not an easy thing to do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line749"><a name="pos749"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> You were there with the body and you are telling us that you cannot say where on his body the person was shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line750"><a name="pos750"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> If I had to say where he was shot then I would have to tell a lie.  It was not easy for me at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line751"><a name="pos751"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> And while he was lying on the wood pile, while he was being burned did you not look where he was shot either.</p>
<p class="line" id="line752"><a name="pos752"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> No I walked away and stood to the side, I did not look, not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line753"><a name="pos753"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> There of the five people did not know where this man was shot.  Because your other two colleagues also say they did not look.</p>
<p class="line" id="line754"><a name="pos754"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I did not look, I am sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line755"><a name="pos755"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line756"><a name="pos756"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Mr Raath the trip on the 10th of August, first to Bloemfontein and then later from Barberton to Komatipoort, the first leg, PE to Bleomfontein, you were in the same car as Mr Kondile, yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line757"><a name="pos757"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> Up to Bloemfontein, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line758"><a name="pos758"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> What was the nature of your conversation with Kondile, was he curious about where you were going to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line759"><a name="pos759"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> It wasn't discussed in the vehicle in my presence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line760"><a name="pos760"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Then from Barberton to Komatipoort, he didn't ask you why you had been driving his car?  Why you had left it at the side of the road?</p>
<p class="line" id="line761"><a name="pos761"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> No he did not talk to me about that, I do not know whether he had already been informed, I have no knowledge of this.  He did not discuss this with me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line762"><a name="pos762"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> If I might go back to Jeffrey's Bay.  As part of Mr du Plessis team, did you too have intimate knowledge about the principal agent and the network in Lesotho?</p>
<p class="line" id="line763"><a name="pos763"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> No it was dealt with by Capt du Plessis himself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line764"><a name="pos764"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> So you had no knowledge at all of those people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line765"><a name="pos765"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line766"><a name="pos766"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Then the last question, I keep jumping up and down the country, back to Komatipoort and the decision to shoot Sizwe Kondile and burn him.  Were you part of the conversation about burning the body?</p>
<p class="line" id="line767"><a name="pos767"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line768"><a name="pos768"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line769"><a name="pos769"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who gave the order that Kondile should be shot at the scene?</p>
<p class="line" id="line770"><a name="pos770"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I do not know who gave that instruction or order.</p>
<p class="line" id="line771"><a name="pos771"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who could have given the order?</p>
<p class="line" id="line772"><a name="pos772"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I don't know, there were three officers present and I don't know, accept it...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line773"><a name="pos773"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The three officers being yourself, van Rensburg and du Plessis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line774"><a name="pos774"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> No it was van Rensburg, Mr du Plessis and Mr Coetzee, they were the officers on the scene.</p>
<p class="line" id="line775"><a name="pos775"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes now you remember that apparently the so-called sleeping drops or tablets were apparently administered or put in his drink by Coetzee, do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line776"><a name="pos776"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> Yes I didn't see this myself but I saw when Coetzee gave him something to drink.</p>
<p class="line" id="line777"><a name="pos777"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No you remember detail of that nature.  Now you did not give the order to shoot, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line778"><a name="pos778"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line779"><a name="pos779"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I want you to tell me who and why is it that you can't remember if you don't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line780"><a name="pos780"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I accept that it would have been Col van Rensburg because he was in command at that stage, that operation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line781"><a name="pos781"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You see he also said that he thinks he gave the order.  But before saying that he says somebody gave an order to shoot and he says he thinks it might have been him. Now that kind of evidence leaves one a bit puzzled.  Were you standing close to each other at the time and if you heard somebody saying, shoot him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line782"><a name="pos782"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> No I stood to one side, we were all sitting around the fire where we had eaten.  I accept that it was Col van Rensburg because he was in charge of the whole operation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line783"><a name="pos783"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It's unlikely that it could have been Coetzee, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line784"><a name="pos784"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That is true yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line785"><a name="pos785"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If it was Col van Rensburg who gave the order, who did he give the order to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line786"><a name="pos786"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I do not know, it was something that had been predetermined which the officers spoke about, I was not part of that discussion.  I only say when this man stood up and shot Kondile.</p>
<p class="line" id="line787"><a name="pos787"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now the man that did the shooting was somebody you had not seen before?  This is the first time you saw him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line788"><a name="pos788"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line789"><a name="pos789"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you know whether he was known to van Rensburg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line790"><a name="pos790"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I accept that he was yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line791"><a name="pos791"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Have you any reason to believe that he might be known to van Rensburg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line792"><a name="pos792"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> Yes as he arrived there with Coetzee and Coetzee was well known to Mr van Rensburg, that's why I think that they knew one another.</p>
<p class="line" id="line793"><a name="pos793"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If Coetzee had told this person to shoot you would have remembered that wouldn't you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line794"><a name="pos794"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I think so yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line795"><a name="pos795"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I want you to think back carefully, did this man pull out his own gun and shoot or did he borrow anybody else's gun?</p>
<p class="line" id="line796"><a name="pos796"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> This man had jeans on with a holster at the side, he pulled out the firearm, and I accept that it was his own or a government firearm, I'm not sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line797"><a name="pos797"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In other words he didn't take the firearm from someone of you who was standing by?  Borrow one of your firearms and then shoot, that isn't what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line798"><a name="pos798"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line799"><a name="pos799"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line800"><a name="pos800"></a><span class="speaker">ADV VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman if you would allow me, there are two matters arising from questioning by members of the Committee.  May I just clarify.</p>
<p class="line" id="line801"><a name="pos801"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes Mr Visser.</p>
<p class="line" id="line802"><a name="pos802"></a><span class="speaker">ADV VISSER:</span> The first point is I think that the evidence is clear but I'm going to ask you about this?  When Mr Kondile was shot near Komatipoort, was it daylight or what was the situation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line803"><a name="pos803"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> It was already dark.</p>
<p class="line" id="line804"><a name="pos804"></a><span class="speaker">ADV VISSER:</span> It was at night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line805"><a name="pos805"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line806"><a name="pos806"></a><span class="speaker">ADV VISSER:</span> And the same while you took the body to the wood before you set it alight, was it darkness as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line807"><a name="pos807"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> Yes it was in the dark.</p>
<p class="line" id="line808"><a name="pos808"></a><span class="speaker">ADV VISSER:</span> You were also asked as to whether you knew who the principal agent was about whom Mr du Plessis testified and you said no, were you aware that there were informers from the security branch who operated in Lesotho, were you aware of this or unaware of this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line809"><a name="pos809"></a><span class="speaker">MR RAATH:</span> I was aware of this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line810"><a name="pos810"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line811"><a name="pos811"></a>	Mr Booyens are you calling any other witnesses?</p>
<p class="line" id="line812"><a name="pos812"></a><span class="speaker">M BOOYENS:</span> If the Committee would just bear with me please, one aspect that we discussed, I just want to find something out from my attorney.</p>
<p class="line" id="line813"><a name="pos813"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line814"><a name="pos814"></a><span class="speaker">ADV VISSER:</span> May I place my position on record in the mean time Mr Chairman just to take up the time that is being used by my learned friend.  Mr Chairman we have no further evidence to present except if Mr Dirk Coetzee gives evidence, the situation changes radically because you will understand that Mr Coetzee is not implicated by these witnesses nor is Mr Danster, so we have a problem with their presence here, but be that as it may I'm not taking any point on that.  But if Mr Dirk Coetzee is to be called in evidence, then obviously there would have to be cross-examination and I can tell you now that there will be at least two witnesses which we would have to call in rebuttal of his evidence.  So I just want to place that on record.  As far as the application is concerned properly as placed in our submission, this is the evidence which we wish to place before you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line815"><a name="pos815"></a><span class="speaker">M BOOYENS:</span> Mr Chairman we are in a similar position, we may want to rebut something in the evidence of Coetzee, should Coetzee give evidence but otherwise we conclude our evidence at this stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line816"><a name="pos816"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Moosa are you calling any witnesses?</p>
<p class="line" id="line817"><a name="pos817"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> Mr Chairman not at this state, we want clarity the directive that was given the last time about Mr Coetzee's evidence in which case we'd consider our position as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line818"><a name="pos818"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But I want to tell you now that the other people who have been dragged here will not be called to give evidence and I'm not going to permit that you know, Mr Coetzee's two companions in the previous application. Their names haven't figured here at all so I want you to know now that Tshikalanga and Nofomela will not be, I will not be calling them to give evidence. Are you calling any other witnesses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line819"><a name="pos819"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> We wouldn't be calling any other witness, as I say it would depend on whether Mr Coetzee is giving evidence and the question of Mr Danster would then be relevant as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line820"><a name="pos820"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No no no 	whatever they do I'm finding out whether you are calling any witnesses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line821"><a name="pos821"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOOSA:</span> Yes I think I'm clear on that, I'm not calling any witnesses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line822"><a name="pos822"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you calling witnesses Mr Valus.</p>
<p class="line" id="line823"><a name="pos823"></a><span class="speaker">MR VALUS:</span> Yes Mr Chairman I would apply to call and I intend to call Mr Danster.</p>
<p class="line" id="line824"><a name="pos824"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You intend to call him.  Is he available.</p>
<p class="line" id="line825"><a name="pos825"></a><span class="speaker">MR VALUS:</span> He is available, he will testify by means of an interpreter, his mother tongue is Xhosa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line826"><a name="pos826"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  Mr Jansen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line827"><a name="pos827"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> Mr Chairman I don't intend calling any witnesses, I'm in the hands of the Committee as far as Mr Coetzee is concerned, I leave it in the hands of the Committee to decide.  If the Committee has clear views on that then obviously I'm in your hands, if the Committee wants to be addressed on that, then obviously I'll address the Committee on how I assess the situation to be.</p>
<p class="line" id="line828"><a name="pos828"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes. My Committee has decided that we'll adjourn now and resume at 9 o'clock tomorrow morning.  By that time we will make known to you Mr Jansen whether the Committee wishes to call Mr Dirk Coetzee or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line829"><a name="pos829"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Chairman before you adjourn, I don't want to interrupt you but before you adjourn would you indulge me in just making one further point about Mr Coetzee please for your consideration in deciding whether you want to call him or not.  Mr de Jager has offered a piece resolution here, and that is on the basis that if Mr Coetzee is not called his evidence won't be taken into account in this application and these applicants evidence won't be taken into account.  That seems to us to be an eminently fair position but the problem is now Mr Chairperson...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line830"><a name="pos830"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> I didn't suggest that, I said we can't take into consideration if he's not called because then he's not being cross-examined in this case and vice versa, your people weren't cross-examined in his application so we can't use your evidence against him without affording him the opportunity.</p>
