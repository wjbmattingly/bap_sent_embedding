Mr Nthekiso was served with a form 2 notice, by registered post at his last known address which was care of the SAPS, Onluste-eenheid 10, Maitland.  That was the address given to me by the prosecutor of the Wynberg Magistrate's Court - Regional Court, rather.   Mr Xegetwane, we had great difficulty in tracing the man, but I understand from my colleague that in fact he saw him at court recently and advised him that the matter was proceeding, but Mr Xegetwane not only indicated he was not the slightest bit interested in this application or indeed, with the continuing proceedings in court.\n\tThe position relating to the applicants in this matter, is that he has, I understand, pleaded guilty to the charges and has been convicted very recently. But he is to return to court for sentencing on or about the 16th of July this year.\n\tI do not know whether Mr Nthekiso is present. May I just ascertain?",

The trial of - this case has been partly heard.  Initially the applicant pleaded not guilty in respect of both charges relating to both victims.  The reason for that was that the only evidence that the State had was a confession which was allegedly extracted from the applicant under duress. It is on that basis, he contested the admissibility of the confession.  The matter has been protracted and continued over a lengthy period and at the last court hearing, the applicant pleaded guilty in respect of the one matter, and that is the one relating to the Ndimphiwe Nthekiso.  The reason being that the other victim, Mr Eric Xegetwane indicated that he is not interested in the court proceedings.\n\tSo the case had been postponed for sentencing to the 16th of July.  Mr Chairman, I will not proceed with leading the further applicant.",

So when we were attending, when we were in the meeting, well, some comrades call me that comrade was close to me, that time Chris Hani was briefing me, with him, about this action we must take, it was Comrade Xhoxho. So he call me and I explain about this house of Xegetwane.  I was already hear that there is a person who is Xegetwane who is involved in this perpetrating of taxi wars and all this things, you see.  He was one of the top people.  So he explained to me that the unit is taken a decision that today we must alarm Xegetwane that he must move out of New Crossroads.

I am going to talk about the attack, while using the R4 and the other hand-gun.  As we had already heard, that there was this taxi violence in the communities,  what used to happen was this.  We realised that there was another organisation that was an opponent of the ANC.  Therefore we realised that you were the person in the forefront of this opponent organisation.  You are among the people who were perpetrating violence in our communities.  That was the reason we came to that decision that we must remove your from our community. That was, the aim was to show you that you are not needed in our communities.  Killing was not our aim.   Because this was a common action, it was something that used to happen in other places to show the people that are not wanted in the communities.",
