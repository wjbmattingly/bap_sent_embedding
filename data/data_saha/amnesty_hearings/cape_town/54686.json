This took place at Site B in Khayelitsha in 1992.  I was a member of the South African National Community Organisation.\n\tThis organisation was to protect the rights of the residents.  This started because it was necessary that the community should have the representatives because they were actually against the Councillors.\n\tAt that time our municipality who was being forced upon us was ...",

Since the police intended to protect the municipality and their Councillors, they were always patrolling in the locations, day and night.\n\tThe residents noted that the police intentions were mainly to divide the intentions of the residents who did not support the municipality at the time.  They initially started by prosecuted SANCO members.  The intention was to demoralise the SANCO leaders so that they did not fight for the rights of the community.\n\tAnd that is when SANCO took a decision that it had to establish a group that was going to protect the residents.  Thereafter SANCO established these Self Defence Units.  After a while I was appointed as one of the leaders of the Self Defence Unit in the region of Site B in Khayelitsha.\n\tOur duty was to protect the residents who did not support the municipality of the time.  Since the ISU was being used to threaten people, we were forced to find ourselves weapons which were the same as theirs so that we could protect ourselves from attacks.\n\tThat is where the war started between the ISU and the SDU.  The amount of attacks upon the homes of the leaders of the SDU increased.  Their houses were burnt by unknown people at night so that in order to arm members of the Self Defence Unit, money was collected from the residents of Site B to buy weapons.\n\tThis money was collected by the leaders of SANCO.  Bongi Mpisane was one of those leaders who collected money.  That made it very clear to us that we were in a war situation between the police and the Self Defence Units.  The police who were assisted by a group of Koevoet members.\n\tAs time went by there were rumours that the people who were collecting money were using the money for their own personal gain in stead of forwarding the original mission.\n\tBongi Mpisane was one of those.  The use of money in this way was not allowed and that led to disagreements between SANCO and the people who were collecting the money and using it for their own use.\n\tThese people who were affected or were involved, broke away, thereafter there were rumours that those breakaways from the SDU like Bongi Mpisane, started to work with the police.  We noticed that the police had excessive information about members of the Self Defence Units and where they could be found.\n\tWe realised that the meetings of the Self Defence Units and our plans were known to the police in detail.  The amount of attacks on the homes of the leaders of the Self Defence Units increased.  It was easy for them to be arrested by the police of the Internal Stability Unit.\n\tThose members who tried to escape, were shot.",

SANCO then took a decision that plans had to be made so that Bongi and the others could be won over to the side of the residents once again.\n\tOn a particular day before the 29th of August 1992, it was rumoured that Bongi Mpisane and his supporters were going to meet a members or certain members of the Internal Stability Unit as usual.  The leaders of the Self Defence Units and I decided that that meeting should be attacked.\n\tThe day and venue were still unknown to us, we decided that we had to go and visit Mpisane soon with the intention to attempt to negotiate with him so that he could come back to us.\n\tIt was also attempted to regain the money which we lost which he collected and spent.  In order to win him back over, we intended for him to tell us the date, time and venue of the meeting between them and the members of the ISU so that we could attack them and if Mpisane was going to refuse to cooperate with us, we were going to force him to lead us to where the meeting between them and the ISU was going to be.\n\tOn the 29th of August 1992 the leaders of SANCO chose myself, Zwelitsha Mkhulutha and Maliqole Mtsange for the abovementioned purpose.",

I never noticed where the bullet struck him, but I realised that they did strike him.  Mpisane went and hid and we eventually gave up.\n\tIn that way our plan failed.  Because of this act, we were arrested and prosecuted.  I was found guilty on these charges that I mentioned above.  I was sentenced to the abovementioned sentence.\n\tDuring our trial I heard that someone had died because of the shooting incident on the day we had attacked Mpisane.  I do not know how this person ended up being injured.  The court also found us guilty of the culpable homicide for the death of this person.\n\tThe act for which I was found guilty was a political act caused by the ill-treatment by the police who were working for the oppressive regime of the time.\n\tThat act happened at a time where those police who were mentioned caused a situation in the residential area which was similar to a war situation.

Once again, that act was aimed at showing the government of the time that the residents did not want the municipal officers that were being forced upon them.\n\tThe act of attacking informants and members of the Internal Stability Units was allowed, accepted and it was a decision was taken by SANCO at the time when the Self Defence Unit was launched.\n\tTruly speaking because of that act, for which we were found guilty, it was very evident that the Councillors had to resign.

And that is when I realised that Bongi and Fundile Madodo held discussions, but we told them that we had meetings and what was the decision taken and there was a confusion in the meeting and thereafter there were no meetings held and they distanced themselves and after my mother's attack, they disappeared.\n\tWhat happened thereafter or before, before leaving I think they did go to the ANC Regional Office whereby members thereof came to us, they came to my house and told me that they hear news that we are shooting each other and they were given an instruction to come and disarm us, but that was untrue, we never shot each other.\n\tBut we told them that all we are having is discussions, but you can go ahead and disarm us, we handed over our firearms and we went to the R Section, there was a Mr Dulah Omar and Willie Hofmeyr present there and there was  a meeting to be held the following day.\n\tI did explain to Tony that comrades you seem to come here uninformed that we are criminals, but it is not true.

When they submitted their applications and out of ignorance of the requirements of the law, they obviously were still under the impression that they were going to go to a court of law, to the same circumstances to a court of law, where they would be in a position of being accused and obviously they were still labouring under that impression that they were still being prosecuted and they had to be defensive in the setting out of their circumstances of this particular offences.\n\tBut had they had this advantage of legal representation at that stage, they would have known that all that is required of them at this present moment and that is going to save them at the present moment, is nothing but the truth.\n\tHad they had that opportunity, I submit Mr Chairman, we would not now be dealing with applicants who seem to be untruthful because apparently their credibility is supposed to be suspect at this particular moment.\n\tAs far as the requirements of the Act is concerned Mr Chairman, I submit that the applications have been submitted in the proper or prescribed manner, complying with the Act.
