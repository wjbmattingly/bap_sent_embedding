<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Morning everybody.  When we adjourned yesterday, General Webb was being questioned by Mr Bizos.      EDWARD WEBB:   (s.u.o.)</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Bizos.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Mr Chairman, we have put before you a typed script of Exhibit L.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Fortunately we didn't have to decipher it, we found the typed copy that was done originally by the person who actually took it or helped to take it, so it's accuracy I think is apparent.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you very much.  We'll mark this L then and we'll just substitute it for the hand-written one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Now has a copy of Exhibit L been made available to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It's a two-page typed document.  Do you have it?  You all have it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR BIZOS:</span> (cont)</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a>	Now please look at paragraph 6:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a>"The contents of the document are obvious and it means exactly what it says.  This document is a very</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a>good example of the fact that there was control over the CCB activities at all times."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a>Do you agree with that conclusion of Gen Joubert?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Chairperson, this statement was made, I don't know what the date was, but ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well it gives a date at the end, 10 July '93.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> "93.  But it relates to a document which was handed in yesterday and which was dated 28 April 1987.  So I have no reason not to accept that that was the date and that was the situation in 1987.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes, what I am asking you is to comment on the contents of paragraph 6. Do you say that - do you accept that the document reads what the General says it means?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Certainly during Gen Joubert's tenure at Special Forces.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> I see.  Is your answer that that may have been the position at the time that Gen Joubert was in charge, but not the position whilst you were in charge, is that what you want to say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I want to say that it appears from my period there that it had changed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> In what way did it change?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> The fact that I didn't know about certain operations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Now who do you say - do you say that these were accidental or just simple mismanagement, or do you say on the evidence that you have heard, that there was a decision somewhere to cut you out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> What the true reason was, I don't know, but I certainly didn't know about everything that was going on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> You didn't of everything.  So that - but one thing was clear was it not, that you expected to be informed of everything that was happening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Of course, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> So that in so far as things happened without your knowledge, they were irregular and contrary to their instructions and contrary to the rules in terms of which the CCB was structured?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> It was according to the rules laid down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry Mr Bizos, if I could just ask a question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Of course, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  General, when you took over from Gen Joubert, did you actually move into his office, physically?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes, Chairperson</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And were there filing cabinets and documents there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Not as far as the CCB was concerned, they had their own files and their own filing cabinets, it wasn't kept at my Head Office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But did you have access to those?  Surely you must have, being the Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> If I wanted to ask for documentation, yes, then I had access to it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you, seeing that you were coming into a new environment, something that was different from the rest of the Army in that it was unconventional, did you make an effort to acquaint yourself with your new command?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I had been properly briefed by Gen Joubert and after that by Col Verster and all the other regiments under my command.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Because one would imagine a document like the one dated the 28th of April, would have been part of the documentation in the CCB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> That document was never shown to me and I was not aware of the contents.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you.  Mr Bizos.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, before you ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a>	Were you shown any documents that set out the aims, the objects, the doctrines, the strategies, the concept of the CCB and what it was intended to be?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> That CCB had its own production plan and they submitted it to me, but it wasn't a document that was actually submitted to me, it was simply a briefing which I received.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Do I take from that that you weren't shown any documents at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> There was no reason for that, Chairperson, it was common practice to make a practical submission.  I suppose I could have asked for documentation, but I never did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> But surely as the Commanding General of a unit, and that's really what it was, even though it wasn't formally linked, you would say "Well I want to  see the budget, I want to see the organogram of the structure, I want to just make sure that everything that should be in place in terms of the original conception of this entity is there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> The budget, that was submitted to myself by the CCB, not the organogram although they told me there were a certain number of regions in existence, but as a result of the objective of the CCB, there was never a personal diagram submitted to me saying we've got so many people in the field and those are their names etcetera, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So you were never in a position to check whether the budget was spent properly, to check that people you were told were on the ground were actually on the ground, 'cause you never verified anything yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, I didn't verify it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a>	General, did it not strike you as odd that you, a decorated General, was asked to move into a nude area -  I don't argue with you whether it was grey or any other colour, but it was certainly an area in which crimes may be committed, such as damage to property, injury to people, even possibly death.  Before moving into such a position having regard ...(no microphone) background in the Army, wouldn't you have wanted to see what is the basis of this thing, where are the documents?  The Head of the Defence Force, the Head of the Army, have I their authority to do this?  Is this authorised by the Minister of Defence and the Cabinet?  Where am I being sent to do these unusual things?  Wouldn't that be a natural reaction of an honourable General?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Chairperson, it was a very big compliment for me to be appointed to Special Forces.  The CCB was only a small unit of Special Forces as a whole and there were a great many submissions made and briefing sessions in order to get your feet on the ground as far as Special Forces as a whole was concerned, so perhaps later more detail would have been a good thing, but at that stage I was too busy to orientate myself regarding the Special Forces.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes, but Special Forces was a broader organisation, it wasn't to commit offences against the law of the land, wasn't there a distinction in your mind in relation to the Special Forces and the job that you were now being offered to take over?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> It was a challenge for me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes, a challenge is one thing, what the question which may indicate some state of mind on your part that you thought this as a possible adventure, but what I am asking you is, whether you were not sufficiently concerned to say, "Where did the ultimate authority for the formation of this group of people come from that I am asked to lead?"</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> The organisation had been founded and I accepted it as such.  My predecessor caused this unit to be established with the necessary authorisation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> But you were to take over, did you think that you had ...(indistinct - no microphone) Army in relation to this, that you had the support of the Head of the Defence Force, that you had the support of the Minister of Defence?  Didn't you want to ask this?  You know if somebody is offered a job which is of an unusual kind, you say "Well you know, where does this come from, I want to know precisely where do I stand"?  You didn't ask yourself that question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I accept it as such, I accepted that it had been approved by the Chief of the Defence Force, Chief of the Army and I just continued.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> So you say the Head of the Army, to your knowledge, and the Head of the Defence Force knew the purpose for which the CCB was formed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> The Chief of the Defence Force had approved it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes, well that's fairly clear from Exhibit L as well, is it not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> That's correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Now I know that Generals want to keep out of politics, but does the Head of the Army go off on a limb such as this to form the CCB, having regard to what it's objectives were, without the authority of the Minister of Defence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I don't know what the channels would be, but the Head of the Defence Force approved it, not the Head of the Army, Head of the Defence Force.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well if you had been the Head of the Army, would you have done a thing like this without the Minister of Defence having authorised you to do this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I was never Chief of the Army, so I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> No, but you were in the "binnekring" so to speak, you were a General, you attended staff meetings.  You were sufficiently trusted to be given this leadership of this body that was going to commit these acts, would you have committed them if you did not know that the Minister of Defence and indeed the President, were party to the formation of this body? - as a General.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I was never placed in that position, I can't answer that question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well you see what you are saying now is consistent with the decisions of the Generals at the time of the Harms Commission is it not, that you would cut off from the bottom the operatives, that you Generals knew nothing about what they did and that you Generals would keep quiet about the involvement of the Minister of Defence and the President and the Security Council?  Was there no decision to that effect before you entered the witness box and misled the Harms Commission?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I reject the type of statement Mr Bizos is making at the moment, he's trying to insinuate that there was a conspiracy between the Generals.  It's absolute rubbish.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well then is it rubbish when we are told by your General Manager, Mr Verster, that there was a lull in the activities of the CCB and also Mr van Zyl - well, I'm corrected, maybe Mr Verster didn't say it, I seem to remember that he did, but certainly Mr van Zyl said that activities were suspended when Mr FW de Klerk took over as President, because he did not know about the CCB and that you had to lie low until Mr de Klerk was informed of its existence.  Is that also "bog", as you describe it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Chairperson, yes, it is rubbish, I know of no order being given as a result of the change in presidency and that actions had to be stopped.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well why would one of the operatives of the CCB talk such nonsense?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> It was the same operative that said that the Minister and the President knew of the actions of the CCB, which is also rubbish.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.  You feel very strongly that you have to deny that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> It's not a question of feeling that, Mr Bizos, it's a question of fact.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Oh.  But now do you agree that going on a tangent, for the Army to kill in the manner in which the CCB was to do it, according to the Head of the Army, in Exhibit L ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> L1.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> The affidavit, Exhibit L.  Oh, I'm sorry, yes you're quite right, L1 paragraph 7.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a>	Do you agree that redefining murder for a country in which the law was supposed to be applied, for the Head of the Army to redefine murder had political implications?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> The Chief of the Army made no such definition, it was the Chief of the Defence Force, Mr Bizos.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> I'm sorry, but you know what I'm talking about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes, but we have to have the facts in front the Committee, and you're starting to confuse me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes, well it's in the documents.  For some of us, unfortunately, these distinctions are not as clear as they are to you and I ask for your forgiveness.  Gen Geldenhuys - shall we refer to him by name?  Was it Gen Geldenhuys that was speaking in Exhibit L1?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Gen Geldenhuys.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes, and what was he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> He was the Chief of the Defence Force.  Chief of the Defence Force.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes, Chief of the Defence Force.  Would the Chief of the Defence Force redefine murder to the other Generals that were present at this meeting without there being a political fallout if it was found out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Chairperson, I am not prepared to comment on what Gen Geldenhuys said in the document, it wasn't said in my presence.  I wasn't there and I saw the document for the first time yesterday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> You see I am going to put to you that you as a General, knew when you took this over, that your activities would have had very serious political implications if they came to the fore.  Would you agree with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Depending on which deeds were committed, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well if they were the deeds which we have heard about in this hearing and ...(indistinct) deeds which are contained in Exhibit D, the Report of the Commission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> What is the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Would there be tremendous political fallout for the country if the activities of the CCB, whether under Gen Joubert or under you, came to the fore?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> If such deeds were committed, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And is that why you misled the Harms Commission so that the Harms Commission could not make a finding as to what the true purpose of the CCB was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> The Harms Commission was misled by the level of approval, the Harms Commission was misled through allegations of it happening inside the country and that's the only way in which the Harms Commission was misled.  The deeds that were committed and for which we received privilege, that was known to the Harms Commission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> I'm asking you for the reason why you misled the Commission by being untruthful before it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I answered that question yesterday, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes, I just thought I would remind you of it.  The State Security Council was openly said to have the function of co-ordinating the activities of the Security Forces, do you accept that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> In a certain measure yes, I have no knowledge thereof.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well you have heard of the Security Council.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Did you not hear what its main purpose was, ostensibly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Not that I can recall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> May I remind you?  That it was to co-ordinate the affairs of the Security Forces.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Probably in wide measures, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry Mr Bizos, I've just received a note from the Sound Engineer to say that there's a problem and that a five minute adjournment is required to fix the sound system, because we're not sure whether we're losing some of what is being said on the tapes.  So if we could take a five minute adjournment for the Sound Engineer to check his system.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MS COLERIDGE:</span> All rise.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">EDWARD WEBB:</span> (s.u.o.)</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Bizos.  I think when we adjourned, if my note is correct, we were talking about the function of the State Security Council, it's main function.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR BIZOS:</span> (cont)</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a>	Do you agree that that was the function of the Security Council, to co-ordinate the activities of the Security Forces?</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Chairperson, I never had any knowledge about the State Security Council's actions or what their tasks were.  I never received any direct orders in this regard.  I accept that they took certain decisions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.  At the time - do you now accept that at the time, the late '80s and certainly when you were the Head of the CCB, it has now emerged that the CCB was not the only body that was committing acts of violence, both against property and persons deemed to be the enemy of the State?  There was Vlakplaas, there was the Security Police, there was the CCB, there were suggestions that the Special Forces were doing things, there were suggestions that Intelligence Forces were committing similar acts.  Did not the Security Council come into being so that it can co-ordinate, amongst other things, the activities of the Police, the Defence Force, the Army and more particularly, the side shoots that were specially established for the purposes of killing people, damaging their property and playing dirty tricks against them?  Did an occasion not arise when it was necessary to co-ordinate this band of friends authorised to commit these acts?</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I repeat, Chairperson, I was not a member of the State Security Council, I had no information about their actions and documents, so I cannot comment on that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> The question was, do you now accept that there were these agencies for, not to use an uglier name, committing these acts?</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> What spread from the newspaper, for example Vlakplaas, in my time I was not aware of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> No, leave the newspapers out of it for a moment.  There was the Commission, the TRC, which heard much evidence coming from the very operatives - do you remember what I asked you about the CCB, Vlakplaas, the Security Police, the Information Services, do you now accept at that time there were various agencies doing a similar job, committing offences against the people of South Africa considered to be the enemies of the State?  Do you now accept that that was so at the time that you were Chairman of the CCB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Apparently there were such organisations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Now at the time - let's deal with '89 when you were the Chairman, were there no discussions how to avoid duplication of acts and the crossing of the wires so to speak, by different agencies pursuing the same or conflicting objectives in relation to a particular individual?</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No discussions with me, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you aware of any discussion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Perhaps I could put it subtly differently if I may.  Are you aware of any other structure that was designed to prevent this duplication of effort?</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Now theoretically what you are telling us ...(indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Your mike, Mr Bizos.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a>	Theoretically, if what you are telling us is the truth, you may have authorised the killing of one of the most valuable informers to the Security structure of South Africa, by not knowing how valuable he or she was to the Security Police or to the National Intelligence or to Military Intelligence, you may unwittingly have done a tremendous harm if there was not this co-operation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Co-ordination.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Co-ordination.  Thank you, that was the word I was looking for, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Theoretically spoken, yes, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Theoretically.  Well was there any step taken by you as Chairman before authorising anything, to determine whether you would not fall into that unfortunate trap?</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I approved no such operation, so I could not fall into such a trap.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Are you saying that as Chairman you didn't authorise any, the commission of any offence against anybody either internally or externally, during your term of office?  Is that what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I'm saying internally, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> You're not prepared to talk about externally.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> That we've decided already on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well we didn't decide, that is what you claim.  But for the purposes of my question, for the purposes of my question, if in fact you were to decide that anyone outside should be killed by your organisation, you may have done a tremendous harm to the other agencies.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Theoretically, yes, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Except, as I said yesterday, if injury or death was foreseen then I would have gone to higher authority for approval.  That means that the higher authority may have communicated with another agency, that I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> You were kept out of the picture.</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I was not involved in such a picture, I had no opportunity to be involved in such a picture.</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> I see.  Of course if Col Verster spoke the truth before this Committee, your premise would be incorrect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> In what regard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> In relation to internal killings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> There were no internal killings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Or conspiracies or attempts to do so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> There were none as far as you were concerned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, killings, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Conspiracies or attempts?</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> The conspiracy has been heard before this Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> I think the point Mr Bizos is putting to you is that you were not involved in any conspiracies or attempts to kill anybody.  That's your evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> That's all he's confirming with you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Do you agree that your evidence in any way at the Harms Commission, had the effect of misleading the Harms Commission in relation to the CCB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I acknowledged it yesterday, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Because I want to refer you to bundle D, pages 58 to 59, where Judge Harms deals with his findings.  Now you had the same counsel as Mr Verster, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And Mr Verster told this Committee things about what was happening internally, which he either denied or claimed privilege for before the Commission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> You stood by listening to Col Verster lying to the Commission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Did you tell your joint counsel that your fellow client was lying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> What joint counsel are you talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> The advocates that were representing you and Mr Verster, counsel with s-e-l, not c-i-l.</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Why not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> We drew up our submission apart.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> False statements were taken and you stood by it and you sat there throughout the proceedings, hearing your subordinate officer, a Colonel, lying and you did nothing about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> That's true, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well knowing that the President of the country had appointed a High Court Judge in order to try and ascertain the truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Also it was put to you, was it not in one of the subsequent proceedings, that the Minister had told you to cooperate fully with the Commission, do you remember what your answer was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> We had to give our full co-operation with the investigation team, namely Gen Badenhorst and Brig Engelbrecht.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Who gave you that advice?</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> That advice, we were asked that by Gen Geldenhuys, to do it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> By Gen Geldenhuys who was your superior, because that was your answer, "Not the Minister, General Geldenhuys told us."  And did you obey the order of your higher office in order to give full co-operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> To the investigation team, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes, but the Investigation Unit was inquiring into things which it put before the Commission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> And Gen Badenhorst declared everything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes, except that he couldn't have made public what you and Verster knew and what the Head of the Army or Defence Force knew, those were kept back from the Commission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Gen Badenhorst made his declaration, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> No, no, but you know, Gen Badenhorst wasn't a party to the CCB conspiracy, he was investigating it and he was attempting to do an honest job and he was thwarted by you, by Verster, the leader of the Army and the leader of the Defence Force, by keeping back information which led to a false conclusion being arrived at by Judge Harms at page 59 of his report.</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Can we please read page 59, Chairperson?</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well what is your answer to my question?  But you're entitled to hear it, I would have thought that you would be very interested.  Let me read to you paragraph B43, B44, in order for the Commission - have you got the exhibit before you, Mr Chairman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I do ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Because it's rather important that this conspiracy to mislead the Judge should come to the fore, because it has not only an affect on the witness's credibility but also the manner in which the other applicants in this case were dealt with by their superiors at the Commission.  If you turn to page ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It's page 58.</p>

<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Page 62 of the Harms Report, but page 58 of our pages.</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Paragraph B43</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a>"An alternative approach by counsel to the question was motivated as follows.  The Minister of Defence and the then Chief of the Defence Force, adopted a plan during 1986, which meant that the ANC had to be maximally disrupted abroad and a covert organisation had to be established which was to be divided into regions.</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a>			The CCB is the covert organisation that was established in accordance with this plan.  Region 6 is an internal region and was envisaged when the plan was adopted.  Members of Region 6 perpetrated these deeds within the borders of the country.  Members of Region 6 were promised indemnity from prosecution beforehand.  Therefore these deeds were authorised by the Minister or the Chief of the South African Defence Force.  Once again their argument ignores material facts and is based on false assumptions.  The plan was as repeatedly stated, to disrupt the ANC abroad.  The policy directive of Special Forces and therefore also of the CCB, contained an express restriction to the effect that offensive action was to take place externally.  The command structure of the CCB was aware of the restriction, realising and understanding that it applied to the CCB.  According to Gen Webb, and there is nothing to the contrary, no internal operations were submitted to higher authority for authorisation.  The allegation by van Zyl and Botha that they were informed that Region 6 had to engage in internal offensive action, cannot in the light of available evidence, be tracked back to higher authority.  The allegation by van Zyl and Botha that they were promised indemnity from prosecution was contested and in any case conflicts with the provisions of the Personnel Plan which states in no uncertain terms that CCB members must obey all the laws of the land."</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a>Now, do you agree that your evidence and Verster's evidence whom you listened to telling the untruths, was relied upon by the Judge in order to come to the conclusion and absolve people from what they should have been found responsible for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> There was never any indemnity or amnesty promised.</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> That's the detail, what do you say about the fact that the Judge says that there was no evidence?  Here was the evidence of Mr Verster, which you knew - you must have known what he knew and what the truth was according to him, some of which we heard here, why didn't you tell the Commission that you knew that Verster was lying, ex post facto, even if you didn't know before.</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> As I testified before the Webster Inquest, I tried to protect Verster at that stage.  ...(transcriber's interpretation)</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> No, no - yes, but you see therefore you have to agree that you assisted in the process of keeping out the Head of the Army, the Head of the Defence Force, yourself, from any culpability before Judge Harms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> That is not true, Chairperson.  If you read the paragraph on page 63, the third sentence from the top</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a>"According to Gen Webb, and there's nothing to the contrary, no internal operations were submitted to any higher authority for authorisation."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a>Because I acknowledged before the Harms Commission that I approved two internal operations.  I asked for privilege and at the end of the Harms Commission I was asked questions by the legal representative of the Defence Force and I said both operations were authorised at my level. ...(transcriber's interpretation)</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, just for ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> You didn't submit any of that to Harms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just for the record, page 63 referred to by the General is in fact page 59 of our bundle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Sorry, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> You didn't speak about that in the Harms Commission, to use the Americanism, you took the fifth, you said that you would not say anything because if you did say anything you might incriminate yourself and that was the end of - that's where it was cut off.</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, Chairperson, I'm very sorry but Mr Bizos does not know his facts.  If you go to the Harms Commission and you look, I think it's Adv Burger, he represented the Defence Force, he asked me in the end for my testimony and I asked for privilege "Who approved it", and I said it was approved on my level.  So your facts are not correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> In respect of what incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Of these two incidents I'm applying for amnesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Did you not claim privilege for those?</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Excuse me, I didn't hear the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Didn't you claim privilege for those before the Commission?</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> How is that consistent, the claim of privilege, but then that you admitted that you authorised them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> It was asked of me - we can look, it's on record, Mr Chairman, if any higher approved orders, I said "No, it was approved on my level."</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> You know I am going to put to you that your evidence doesn't make sense because it's very clear that you're claiming privilege and you claimed it successfully.

<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a>Did you say that, and did you claim privilege?</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Now you refer to the end of your cross-examination, which I am going to refer to you and then I will ask you a question.  I want to read that into the record.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a>"CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR BURGER:  (on page 66)  Just shortly please, did you during your term of service as Chairman of the CCB, ever get approval from higher authority to carry out deeds of violence internally?"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a>		"During my time the Special Services were - never ever approached me on any such operations." (sic)</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a>		"It was insinuated to you that Dr Webster ..."</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a>It doesn't matter.  Now do you still want to persist that you did not claim privilege for those things?</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I never denied it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Very well.  That is all for my purposes, if your counsel wants to ask you any more questions about it, he can do so in re-examination.</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a>	Now, isn't it a function of a higher officer to take responsibility for the action of his underlings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> At the Harms Commission, were the operatives  in any way let down by you and Mr Verster in relation to their authority?</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Not by me, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> By Mr Verster to your knowledge, whilst you were sitting there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well why protect a Colonel and let the other people that were authorised to do the dirty work, hang out so to speak?</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I didn't know the operatives, it not excuse Chairperson, I tried to protect Joe Verster.</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes, when you tried to protect Verster you knew that Verster had authorised them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Is that consistent with what is expected of a high-ranking officer in the Army?</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> But you did it nevertheless.</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.  Now throughout your evidence, including at page 2120, you seem to concede that if there was anything to happen in relation to the murder or serious injury or serious damage to anyone within the country, you would have had to take it to higher authority.</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Now who told you that, when did he tell you and under what circumstances was that said to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> It was during the briefing given to me by Gen Joubert before I took over.</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Implicit in that conversation was an indication to you that there was a scenario which might occur that the harm mentioned before would be directed against some individuals internally.  Did you ask Gen Joubert, your predecessor, "But what are you talking about, what is this business about death or killing or damage to property that I've got to go to higher authority for?  On what basis are you telling me this?  Who is going to do it and on whose authority and who will come to me and who will approach me to get authority?"  Did you ask any of those questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Why not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> As I testified yesterday, Gen Joubert never spoke to me directly about internal operations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> You've already settled that aspect by your answer to the previous question, that Gen Joubert expected someone might come to you for higher authority for internal operations.  From one General to the other, one would have expected "What are you talking about, who is going to come and ask me to commit murder or blow up a building or play any other dirty trick against any individual that I have to go to higher authority for?  What am I letting myself in for?"  Isn't that the natural reaction of one General to another, if what you are saying is true?</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> It should be like that, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Why wasn't it as it ought to be?</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Because it was left in the air.</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> But how matters of life and death be left in the air, General?</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> As I said yesterday, Gen Joubert never told me, never spoke to me about the fact that I could operate internally.</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> No, we've already settled that, Sir, the question was, how could one General to another leave matters of life and death in the air?  Please answer that question.  It wasn't asked of you yesterday, it is asked of you for the second time now, please answer it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I don't know, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well what does that mean, you don't know?  Either you are suffering selective amnesia, or you are not telling the truth and that is the reason why you cannot answer that simple question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I have no explanation, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes, we'll leave it at that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, General Webb, this briefing that you had with Gen Joubert, did he make no mention of Region 6?</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, he told me, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Because that's an internal - and he told you that's an internal region?</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes, the details I got from the CCB, the detailed briefing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I'm just trying to understand your answer saying that he didn't talk about internal operations or he didn't mention ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Internal operations, no he didn't speak about that.  But by insinuation, because we founded this internal section where Special Forces were already operative internally, by insinuation yes, we had the capacity to operate internally.</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, and then the actual modus between how operatives conducted themselves in Region 9 and Region 6, was there any difference?  There was any difference stated, was there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, Chairperson, except because in Region 6 there were former police officers and it gave them further possibilities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes Mr Bizos.</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, just if I might.  Who briefed you together with Verster on the CCB itself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> General Joubert ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You said you had a briefing with Verster.</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Was Verster present when Joubert briefed you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So who was with Verster when he briefed you on the CCB itself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Col Verster briefed me on my own and then also with regard to Region 6.  Staal Burger was present and Verster was also present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So when you were briefed on each region separately, was each Manager of that region present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, Verster and Hymer briefed me about the rest of the CCB and Staal Burger and Joe Verster were present when he briefed me about Region 6.</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Yes, and just one other aspect if you'll allow me.  Sorry to intervene Mr Bizos.</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a>	You seem to be giving the impression that you were just a conduit for authority, that if there was a decision and it involved a killing, well you would have just passed it up the line, but surely that isn't so, you had to make a qualitative choice yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Of course, Chairperson, I would have made a contribution.</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And if you thought something was a non-starter you would have refused it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> The question then is, on what basis would you at your level then evaluate things?  If you were going to refuse something you would have had to evaluate information and you've already told us you never ever evaluated or verified anything yourself, so how could you say no, based on what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I received different inputs by Special Forces Headquarters and if something was submitted by the CCB that I didn't approve of, for whichever reason, it could have been stopped there, or if it was acceptable I could have said, very well, let me - if it was necessary, get further approval.  ...(transcriber's interpretation)</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Well you see that's what I asked you yesterday and you specifically said you hadn't actually followed anything up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, you asked me about the bombing and I didn't take that further.</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> I also asked you a general question about "What other sources did you use?"  Because you spoke about having access to sources and you said in relation to Region 6 you didn't actually even follow any of those things up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes the one incident, the bombing incident, it wasn't followed up.  But as a result of my position I received several inputs, there were documents that I had to read, there were briefings at Headquarters of Special Forces and when I went to CCB they briefed me about incidents or whatever, or if they wanted to do an operation.  So in my position you got different inputs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You see these briefings at Special Forces, what bearing did they have on the work of the CCB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> During my time, none, except it might have happened that Bishop Tutu's name was mentioned in whichever context, that came out of an information report and so forth.  But in my time, not really. ...(transcriber's interpretation)</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Well for example, did such briefings entail a prioritisation of targets?</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So how would you know that person X was a target or person Y was a target?  How would you know when Verster came to you and reported on the activities of Region 6 or any other region, that what they were doing was in line with what other people were doing and that ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> But Verster never came to me with a target.</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> When he came to report on his work and on the work of the CCB, for example, "We're monitoring person X, because in the long term it links in with this or with that project which we've authorised and remember budget X", that's the nature of the report you would have received from him on a monthly basis, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes, that should have been the report, ja.</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Not there should have been, what else would you have spent an hour talking to him about every month?</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> But he never made such a submission to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So in all the time that you were head of the CCB, you never got any of that kind of contextual report, where he gave you on-going reports about what work was happening and who was being monitored and what they were doing in Zambia, or what they were doing in Angola?  You never got any of that kind of report?  I'm not dealing with the details of any specific project.</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, I got a lot of feedback, especially about external operations and frequent feedback, but he never came to me to say "We should eliminate such and such a person", or to ask approval for it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> I'm not talking about elimination.  You see I'm not talking about elimination, I'm specially not talking about elimination, I'm talking about the kind of detail that you would have had to deal with in a monthly report by Verster to you, with specific reference to Region 6.  You see according to what we've heard so far and you've been here the whole time, Region 6 was monitoring people, primarily.</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">M LAX:</span> And it's inconceivable that that couldn't have been the content of what he would have reported to you about, because that's all they were doing according to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> It now appears from the reports and so on of the Truth Commission, that there were several things in which the CCB were involved, but ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> We're talking about Region 6, General.</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes, Region 6.</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Don't confuse the issue with all the other stuff.</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> It appears that they weren't particularly effective.</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> We're not talking about effective, we're talking about how active they were and the little bit that they were doing it appears from what we've heard, that they were monitoring lots of people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> So monitoring at that stage was very important for them, that was in the beginning stages.  Special operations, with all respect, doesn't take place over night.  There are some operations that you plan which could take you up to five months to get everything into place, it simply can't happen overnight.  It's not simply a enemy target on the one side and yours on the other side and you launch an attack, it simply doesn't work that way.  You have to find out where is the enemy, who is the enemy, all their routines etcetera, etcetera, and only then can you start placing yourself in position, finding out what would be an appropriate time for an attack.  So it's a very time consuming thing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> General, I absolutely understand all that, that's precisely why I'm asking you these questions, because you don't just monitor people in isolation, you don't just monitor them for no reason whatever.  I mean you've just given us the exact reason why people are monitored, it's to develop a profile, it's to look at the kinds of strategies that are required, it's to look at what your options are tactically and strategically and then you marry all of that with target prioritisation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes, correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Now that's precisely the kind of stuff that I would have expected Verster and you to have spoken about in that portion of your meeting that you had every month when you dealt with Region 6, but it's been your evidence so far that you didn't talk about that sort of stuff because you don't know anything about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> We didn't only discuss Region 6, we discussed the entire CCB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Precisely, I know that, but we're focusing on Region 6 because we're not dealing with all your other stuff at this point in time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> But Mr Lax, we discussed many things and I can't remember everything now that we discussed, but it wasn't simply just a happy-go-lucky meeting, it was a serious discussion and detail certainly formed part of that discussion, it had to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You see the reason I'm asking these questions is this, is that up to now every bit of business that's been referred to, and we can only infer from the questions that you've been asked and what you've testified about, you say you know nothing about except Lubowski and his internal monitoring.</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> The rest you know absolutely nothing about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So on your version there's nothing else that Verster would have spoken to you about, because they weren't doing anything else, on your version.</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> If you talk about Region 6, that could be the case, but that was not what happened.  We were talking about several things.</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> But you see, then the next question is, well you are the Commanding General and you see that Region 6 is doing precious little, surely the question in your mind is "What work are they doing?  They're eating up our budget, what are they doing?"</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes, and they seem to be extremely inefficient, non-effective.  But that only formed a very small part of the entire operation which was under my control, it formed a small part of it.  And they only became operational on the 1st of January and they still had to find their feet and establish themselves and to recruit non-aware members etcetera, to make them truly effective.  As I have tried to explain, it was a protracted process and perhaps in my view at the time they were not that effective because a lot of things still had to be put in place etcetera, before they could act.</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Yes, but even eight/nine months later you still weren't getting much production.</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> One can accept that it will take a few months to get established or you got to develop contacts, but the fact is these weren't people who came in out of the blue, these were people who came in off the ground, they were policemen, that's why you chose them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes, but people who first had to be re-orientated according to our methods, to act according to our methods and not like just ordinary policemen and that's also a big adjustment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> But it's not the method, it's the connections that they had.</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes, that was an advantage, but you must also be careful with the connections that it's not revealed for whom he is working.  So it was a complicated matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> But you see that's precisely what they did, because they used the same kind of connections they would have used as policemen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Are we talking about Slang van Zyl, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And some of the others, because the others asked for those very same connections.  For example, Gavin Evans in that incident they asked for the very same connections that he had.</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Sorry, Mr Chairperson, the reason for that was that the other operatives, "bewustelike lede" had not yet recruited their own people, they were - because Mr van Zyl, according to the evidence, had recruited these "onbewustelike lede".</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You see I'm aware of that, but the point is that it's the type of people that they wanted to use, not the fact - and that's precisely what you wouldn't have wanted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I'm sure Col Verster would also not have wanted it like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Ja.  Look, the simple point, and we're getting side-tracked here, is that in terms of what you understood to be your powers and your authorities, the kinds of decision making you would have been required to make would have required of you a very, certainly much more of an extensive knowledge of what was going on than you professed to have had.</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Are you referring to the information which was given to me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Yes, you see you weren't a conduit as I said earlier, you weren't just a channel for authority, you actually were a person who made the authority, you weren't the rubber stamp.</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And in order to exercise that authority, you were required to have knowledge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> But you say you didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, I was properly briefed in terms of, for instance the bomb incident in Athlone, how can you tell me that I didn't have information about that?  To be able to make a decision I got the necessary information relating to that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Well I don't want to intervene in Mr Bizos' cross-examination, there are a hundred questions I would want to ask you about in due course, I'm talking in general terms though, because it's just that incident that you know about.  In one year, only one incident, plus the Tutu one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> But in a whole year and a bit more of your being in command you were only consulted twice.  And then yes, you were consulted about Lubowski's monitoring as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes.  When I had to take certain decisions I made sure that I got proper and correct information relating to that and if monitoring was still being done and so on, then there wasn't the appropriate flow of information to me because at that stage then there couldn't have been a plan.  It's only once a plan had been formulated by Verster, they would submit the plan to me and the information would then be linked with that plan.</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Besides the plan and the "voorlegging" which was made to you, what external sources did you yourself use?</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> What was available to me as the Commanding General, it was paperwork, documents from Military Intelligence who sent us intelligence reports that I read, plus then the briefings on a daily basis from Special Forces Head Office, their intelligence staff.</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So you used Special Forces intelligence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Anything else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I think those were the two primary sources.</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> What would they know about the Early Learning Centre?</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, I'm not saying I used them for the Early Learning Centre, you asked me the same question yesterday and I'm saying that in that regard I used only the information which the CCB gave me.  I didn't use information from my own Head Office and their intelligence staff.  Do you understand how the set-up worked, Mr Lax?</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> No, no, I hear you, I heard you, I'm just trying to put myself in your shoes and to ascertain what kind of questions one would have asked.  Sorry, I've intervened for far too long.  Mr Bizos, perhaps you should carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think this would probably be an appropriate time to take the tea adjournment.  We'll take a 20 minute tea adjournment.</p>

<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR BIZOS:</span> (cont)</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a>	In answer to a question by the Chairman yesterday you said that the operatives of District 6 were subject to - I'm sorry, Region 6, were subject to military discipline, is that what you said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And if they committed any breach of the military code, they were subject to a Court Martial.</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well that's - how is that consistent with people whose job was to break every rule in the Military Code?</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> They were remunerated by the Defence Force, appointed by the Defence Force and that's why they resorted under the Regimental Disciplinary Code.</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Everything that they did was contrary to the Military Code.  Does the Military Code authorise anybody in the Army to commit offences?</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Or to commit perjury?</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Or to employ gangsters to do their work?</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well I think I've done enough in relation to that, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Maybe can I just ask a question.  I'm sorry, Mr Bizos.</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> ...(indistinct - no microphone)</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> If a person would be brought into a Court Martial, would that not expose his activities in the CCB, because I understand their activities were supposed to be secret?</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, that is so, but you can have a Court Martial in camera.</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Okay, thank you.  Thanks, Mr Bizos.</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And you would have expected the person that heard this in camera to break their oath of office if they were Judges and Prosecutors, not to report the crimes that were evidenced before them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> The Regiment of Discipline and Military law, I suppose they didn't have the right really to hear somebody on a charge of murder perhaps.</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> No, I don't think that you are coming to terms with my question, you're dealing with an exception possibly, but have you understood the question in general terms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think the question would be, just to give an example, if a person, let's say he's being Court Martialled for failing to obey an order, a military thing, and it comes out in the Court Martial that he failed to obey an order to go and murder somebody ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Or to blow up a building.</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ... or to blow up a building, then there would be some duty in law, a duty in law in the person receiving that information of a crime being committed such as murder, to report that to the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> That's correct, Chairperson, it would be reported to the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> You would also have had to have a compliant lawyer representing the accused, that he would keep quiet about the crimes that were disclosed, and I would hope that there were not too many compliant lawyers around.</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> That is not a question that I can answer.  We never had such an example, so were are simply sitting here and speculating actually.</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.  A copy of your evidence in the Webster Inquest was made available to you, have you seen it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is this the document that was placed on the table this morning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman.  Could we have a bundle number for it please, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It will N.</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> No, not exhibit, bundle.</p>

<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Now I don't want to take up time by referring to all the specific contradictions between that evidence, your evidence here and your evidence before the Harms Commission, there are just one or two things that I want to ask you about it.  Are you satisfied that this is a correct record of what you said before His Lordship, Mr Justice Stegman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And in so far as it conflicts with your evidence either here or at the Harms Commission, is there anything further that you want to say about it, or any explanation that you want to offer?  Because we are going to refer to the contents of this as a statement of yours made on a previous occasion, during the argument.  Do you want to add anything to it, or explain anything?</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Well I had no opportunity to read it, the document was handed to me this morning.</p>

<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a>	Well we'll proceed on the basis that it's correctly recorded, you'll have an opportunity possibly to read it and you can consult with your counsel, your attorney if there is anything that is wrong or anything else that you want to explain it.  Can we proceed on that basis, so that we do not take up time?  I see that your legal representative nods, can we proceed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> There are just two or three things in it that I want to draw attention to, which you might want to deal with.

<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Region 6, CCB at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Well it seems from the evidence that I wasn't completely in control.</p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> I want to turn now to the two specific matters in respect of which you have applied for amnesty.  First of all, did you apply for amnesty because these are two matters in which you knew before you entered the witness box in the Harms Commission, that there would be evidence against you of conduct which may have led to your criminal prosecution?</p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> When did you become aware that there was evidence that may incriminate you in criminal acts in relation to these two matters?</p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> By my own evidence which I gave, by requesting a privilege.  Thereby I implicated myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> But did the fact that van Zyl had given evidence of this before the Commission ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And Kalla Botha?</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And others.  Didn't you feel that you might be prosecuted on that evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Chairperson, I testified before the Harms Commission and I requested privilege.</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> But one of the reasons why you do ask for privilege is because you are afraid that you may be charged for committing criminal acts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, I believed bona fide that what I had done was correct or right in those circumstances.</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Then you had no right to claim privilege.  Because if you've got a right to do things you don't need privilege, do you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> It wasn't in a court, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Why are you bothering to apply for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Because now in retrospect I can see that my actions weren't right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And what do you hope to achieve if you get amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> What do you mean, what am I trying to achieve?</p>
<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> What was your motivation, why did you apply for amnesty?  Other than the purpose of possibly avoiding prosecution for criminal acts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> That the truth must be revealed now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Now did it occur to you that as a General on top of this structure, that the truth may be that if you told us about everything that you knew, both inside and outside the country, in order to salve your conscience and in order to - you know what it says there, "Truth, the Road to Reconciliation", not just a portion of the truth, did it not occur to you to be open about things that you knew which did not implicate you in criminal activities directly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> My conscience is clear, Chairperson, I sleep well at night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well that may be evidence of something else, General, but we will leave it at that if you're sleeping comfortably at night.  Tell me, you told us that your applications for amnesty were the same as previous applications, is that what you said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> You made a similar application on exactly the same facts in 19 - the early '90s, what year did you say it was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> 1990.</p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> 1990.  As soon as the first Indemnity Act was promulgated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And you say that it's exactly the same.</p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> As far as I know, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And did you have a copy of that application when the present applications were made?</p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I think our legal representatives kept copies.</p>
<p class="line" id="line546"><a name="pos546"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Which legal representative had a copy of your application made in 1990?</p>
<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> It was done by Adv Hattingh.</p>
<p class="line" id="line548"><a name="pos548"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And who was the attorney?</p>
<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Adv Hattingh, Adv Wessels and the attorney - well I mentioned him yesterday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Wagener.</p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, no, ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You said Havenga yesterday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Havenga, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Havenga or Wagener?</p>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Havenga.</p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Havenga.  Is he an attorney?  Is he still in practice?</p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> As far as I know, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> It was Wagener, because yesterday I thought it was ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think he did mention the name Havenga yesterday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes, I heard Wagener, because of his association with many Generals.  Sorry about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a>	Now where is he to be found?  That's Mr Havenga.  Does he practice under his own name or is he a member of a big firm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, I think he has his own firm, he's in Centurion, Pretoria.</p>
<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> In Centurion.  Well ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a><span class="speaker">UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:</span> Mr Chairperson, may I just mention I also practice in Centurion and there was a firm Havenga, but I don't think they exist any longer, they no longer in Centurion in any event.  I stand to be corrected, but I don't think there is such a firm in Centurion anymore.</p>

<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Which attorney did these applications?</p>
<p class="line" id="line568"><a name="pos568"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> This last one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Ja.</p>
<p class="line" id="line570"><a name="pos570"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> It was Adolf Malan.</p>
<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Now if they were the same, because you said that, he must have had a copy of the '90 application in order to copy them into this form.</p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.  And where is this Mr Malan?</p>
<p class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> He's in Pretoria.</p>
<p class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Practising under his own name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> As far as I know, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.  I see Pretoria counsel nodding his head, so that's very helpful.</p>
<p class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a><span class="speaker">UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:</span> Chairperson, if I may help, Mr Adolf Malan is from Adolf Malan and Vermeulen Attorneys, and they're also currently the attorneys of record of Dr Wouter Basson, and he practices in Pretoria.</p>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> ...(indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, your button, Mr Bizos.</p>
<p class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes, thank you for that information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a>	You see we would like to see those applications and - well you have no objection to your attorney handing them over?</p>
<p class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Of course not, it should be with the Department of Justice.  It ought to be there, all these applications were sent through, through the correct channels.</p>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Very well, I will find them.  Now I want to deal with the first application, that is the one relating to Archbishop Tutu.  I want to start with 1.3.  You say that a study was done on the superstitions - bundle A198, Mr Chairman, a study was done on the superstitions of the population groups in the Republic of South Africa, who did this study?</p>
<p class="line" id="line585"><a name="pos585"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I don't specifically who did the study, the information was conveyed to me by the CCB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line586"><a name="pos586"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> It's sounds a strange study.  What relevance was there to the superstitions of the black people of South Africa in relation to the Archbishop of Cape Town or the Anglican Church and one of the foremost Christian religious figures in the country, and one might say with due respect, of the world, what did the superstitions have to do with it?  What superstition was referred to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> These superstitions did not relate directly to the Archbishop himself, it related to the people, the labourers working for him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line588"><a name="pos588"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Oh, who was going to be intimidated, the Archbishop or the workers that were working for him, the gardeners and other people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line589"><a name="pos589"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> In the first place the purpose was that the gardener or the labourer or whosoever, that he was supposed to see the foetus and then should be led to believe that Bishop Tutu had been placed under some kind of spell or witchcraft and that he would no longer want to work for him and in so doing, to try to reduce his support base.</p>
<p class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> That's a very involved political motivation, let's try and examine it.  Did the CCB, on the authority of the General, devise a plan to get rid of a gardener?</p>
<p class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> To get rid of?</p>
<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> To get rid of a gardener working for Archbishop Tutu.  Is that what you are telling us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line593"><a name="pos593"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> In that people ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line594"><a name="pos594"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> No, is that what you said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a><span class="speaker">MR H DU PLESSIS:</span> Chairperson, with all due respect, can Mr Bizos please give the witness an opportunity to answer the question please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line596"><a name="pos596"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> ...(indistinct - no microphone)</p>
<p class="line" id="line597"><a name="pos597"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, your mike's off again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line598"><a name="pos598"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Have I summarised it correctly so far, then you can add whatever you want.  Have I summarised the position correctly up to now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line599"><a name="pos599"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The question is, was the plan devised to get rid of the gardener in the employ of the Archbishop?</p>
<p class="line" id="line600"><a name="pos600"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, that's not correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line601"><a name="pos601"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> That's not correct.  Well why did you bring the gardener into it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line602"><a name="pos602"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> It was so that the people who worked for him and who were superstitious themselves, that they be influenced.</p>
<p class="line" id="line603"><a name="pos603"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Who were the people that were working for him that you hoped would stop working for him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line604"><a name="pos604"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I don't know, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line605"><a name="pos605"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> But you know you're a General, here is - you know I think that the Afrikaans word "eienaardig" is a much better word than strange, "'n eienaardige ding" that you must hang up a foetus of a baboon in order to get rid of the Archbishop's staff.  Have I now summarised it correctly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line606"><a name="pos606"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line607"><a name="pos607"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Not all the staff, just the black staff.</p>
<p class="line" id="line608"><a name="pos608"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line609"><a name="pos609"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> How many black staff worked for the Archbishop at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line610"><a name="pos610"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I can't remember, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line611"><a name="pos611"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Did you ask?  Did you ask?</p>
<p class="line" id="line612"><a name="pos612"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Possibly I did yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line613"><a name="pos613"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well "dis moontlik" isn't very helpful.  Can you please tell us whether it was two or three?  I assume there was a gardener or two, there was a cook and there was a cleaner, possibly a driver which may have been white, some of them may have been white, may have been black, but how many people were you going to deprive the Archbishop of their service?  How many people and how difficult did you think it would be for the Archbishop to replace them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line614"><a name="pos614"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I don't know, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line615"><a name="pos615"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> But you know you started a serious plan, I mean surely these questions come to mind, to the mind of a General, never mind an ex-Lieutenant from Brixton Murder and Robbery.  Any answer to that question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line616"><a name="pos616"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Maybe I asked those questions, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line617"><a name="pos617"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> I'm sorry, what was your answer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line618"><a name="pos618"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He said "Maybe I asked those questions, I don't know."</p>
<p class="line" id="line619"><a name="pos619"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Oh, but you don't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line620"><a name="pos620"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, just ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line621"><a name="pos621"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> No, please do, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line622"><a name="pos622"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You say a study was done of the various black "bevolkingsgroepe", from which particular group did this superstition come from, this one about knocking in nails in the tree and hanging a baboon foetus?</p>
<p class="line" id="line623"><a name="pos623"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I don't know, I'm assuming that the people who did the study would have determined where it came from.</p>
<p class="line" id="line624"><a name="pos624"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But you don't know which one, whether it's Venda or Xhosa or Zulu or Pedi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line625"><a name="pos625"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line626"><a name="pos626"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> But now, did you ask whether these people - there was any information about the people who were working there, whether they were superstitious or they were perhaps devout Christians, free of any of the superstitions of what you thought were the superstitions of the black people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line627"><a name="pos627"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, I didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line628"><a name="pos628"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Now did you give authority ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line629"><a name="pos629"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line630"><a name="pos630"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> ... that somebody must go and ask Dr Wouter Basson's - sorry, to ask Wouter Basson to go and get a veterinary surgeon to do an operation on a baboon to get a foetus?  Did you authorise that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line631"><a name="pos631"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I didn't know who was involved in procuring the foetus.</p>
<p class="line" id="line632"><a name="pos632"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> But did you authorise this act?</p>
<p class="line" id="line633"><a name="pos633"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I authorised the act.</p>
<p class="line" id="line634"><a name="pos634"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.  But now let us assume that you succeeded in getting rid of a number of people working for the Archbishop, did you hope that that would have deterred the Archbishop from calling for sanctions against South Africa, from supporting the cause of the United Democratic Front, which primarily was a cause of the rest of the establishment of democracy in the country?  And even if you were correct in your suspicions that the Archbishop was a member of the ANC, which I'm sure he would have denied, did you think that he was going to give up his lifelong struggle for democracy in South Africa by the means which he chose to employ, just because you managed by some primitive superstitious way which you were not sure whether it would work or not, to stop the committed Archbishop from doing what he had been doing from his days as a student?  Is that what you are telling the Committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line635"><a name="pos635"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> We hoped that it would work, that his labourers would leave him, that there would be a rumour going around that he was placed under a spell and that he could not get any labourers and that his support would diminish.</p>
<p class="line" id="line636"><a name="pos636"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well then were you going to advertise this for everybody living in the Western Cape, so that in this employer-friendly area there would be no-one prepared to work for their Archbishop, is that what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line637"><a name="pos637"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> We hoped that it would work.</p>
<p class="line" id="line638"><a name="pos638"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> You know hope must be realistic, you're not a superstitious man yourself are you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line639"><a name="pos639"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line640"><a name="pos640"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> So hope must have some realistic prospect of success before you commit what appears on the face to most reasonable people I would suggest, a ridiculous proposal and a ridiculous act.</p>
<p class="line" id="line641"><a name="pos641"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> That question only an anthropologist would be able to answer, somebody who knows about the habits of people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line642"><a name="pos642"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well you know I would like to find out who this expert ethnologist or ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line643"><a name="pos643"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It's an anthropologist.</p>
<p class="line" id="line644"><a name="pos644"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> ... anthropologist was that gave the CCB this advice.  Please can you help us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line645"><a name="pos645"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, I can't, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line646"><a name="pos646"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well will you please ask the people involved that came to you for your permission, who was this expert on human behaviour and so knowledgeable about the superstitions of people that he gave this advice?</p>

<p class="line" id="line667"><a name="pos667"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Ja, very good, very good.  Any serious minded anthropologist would have suggested that this would have had the desired effect in intimidating Bishop Tutu?</p>

<p class="line" id="line669"><a name="pos669"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Now this business about the intimidation was not really against Bishop Tutu, the intimidation would have been on the servants.  To use your usual word.</p>
<p class="line" id="line670"><a name="pos670"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Intimidation of Archbishop Tutu through his labourers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line671"><a name="pos671"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> That it was through his employees doesn't appear in your application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line672"><a name="pos672"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> That's true, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line673"><a name="pos673"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Nor do any of the operatives mention that that was the intention, that the intention was to intimidate the workers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line674"><a name="pos674"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just to get back, was there any research done - we're getting back to this question about a study was done of the "bevolkingsgroepe" and it had come up that driving nails in a driveway and hanging a foetus was an act which would cast superstition and look like a spell has been spun.  I must say it's the first time I've heard about such superstition and - I'm certainly unaware of it.  Personally, I live in Transkei and I've never come across - I'm not saying it doesn't exist, but I've never heard of it.  Now if all the people were working, who were working for the Bishop as labourers, came from a place where the hanging of a foetus and he driving in of nails into the driveway meant nothing to them, let's say for instance they came from Transkei and the superstition applied to people who came from the far north or something like that, then it wouldn't work.</p>
<p class="line" id="line675"><a name="pos675"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Not at all, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line676"><a name="pos676"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So in other words, there must have been some research done as to the origin of the persons who were in the employ of the Bishop who worked at Bishopsgate, in order for it to have worked</p>
<p class="line" id="line677"><a name="pos677"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> There must have been.</p>
<p class="line" id="line678"><a name="pos678"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And was that told to you, were you told "Look there's 10 people who work here and so many come from such an area", or whatever "and some of them may be open to the desired effect"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line679"><a name="pos679"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> It was told to me that there was a study done and by doing this we would get the desired effect, or we should get that effect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line680"><a name="pos680"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you didn't have any details as to what that study entailed?</p>

<p class="line" id="line784"><a name="pos784"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> You see because if we take your statement on its face value, without you adding the ...(indistinct) to influence the employees, it may be interpreted that if this was given publicity, that behold the black Archbishop is indulging in superstitious practices.  Was that your intention?</p>
<p class="line" id="line785"><a name="pos785"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line786"><a name="pos786"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> General, was this the first project that was put to you for approval relating to Region 6?</p>
<p class="line" id="line787"><a name="pos787"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> It was the first or the second, I'm not sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line788"><a name="pos788"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well was it before the Athlone bombing?  Because that was the 30th of August.</p>
<p class="line" id="line789"><a name="pos789"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> That was the 30th of August.</p>
<p class="line" id="line790"><a name="pos790"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I can't recall, I think it was the first.</p>
<p class="line" id="line791"><a name="pos791"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> According to my application it only says "middle to end of '89".  There's not a specific date, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line792"><a name="pos792"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> I'm just looking for a reference, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line793"><a name="pos793"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Because if it was the first project, what did you think of it at the time?  You know, taking into account your military background, fighting wars, training soldiers and now you come across and the first project is about hanging a baboon foetus and driving nails, what did you personally thing, feel?  Did you really think it was a serious operation that was destined for success?</p>
<p class="line" id="line794"><a name="pos794"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Chairperson, it was a strange suggestion but it was also brilliant in so far as would it work it would have been brilliant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line795"><a name="pos795"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Have you got a clear recollection of Mr Verster coming to you to ask for your approval for this to be done?</p>
<p class="line" id="line796"><a name="pos796"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Reasonably, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line797"><a name="pos797"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes, a sufficiently reasonable memory of it.  Did you or he laugh when this proposal was made?</p>
<p class="line" id="line798"><a name="pos798"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line799"><a name="pos799"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Strange, because Mr Verster said that he thought that this was a joke and I would have thought that either he or you or both of you would have laughed at this brilliant joke.</p>
<p class="line" id="line800"><a name="pos800"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line801"><a name="pos801"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> We're trying to find a reference of someone who we remember but we can't find the reference, but I must put it to you.  If anyone had said that it was, the purpose was in order to show the superstitions of the Bishop himself, would that be correct or incorrect?</p>
<p class="line" id="line802"><a name="pos802"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Not according the my briefing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line803"><a name="pos803"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Did you watch with interest what the result of this was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line804"><a name="pos804"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I got feedback, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line805"><a name="pos805"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Did you get a report-back?</p>
<p class="line" id="line806"><a name="pos806"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I got a report-back, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line807"><a name="pos807"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> From whom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line808"><a name="pos808"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> From Col Verster.</p>
<p class="line" id="line809"><a name="pos809"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> What did he say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line810"><a name="pos810"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> He said that the labourer found the foetus and he removed it and afterwards we learnt that Bishop Tutu was not even briefed about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line811"><a name="pos811"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Was intended that the Bishop should be there, when the planning was done?</p>
<p class="line" id="line812"><a name="pos812"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, but the aim was against the employees.</p>
<p class="line" id="line813"><a name="pos813"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> No, but you say that Mr Verster told you that the Archbishop was not even there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line814"><a name="pos814"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Afterwards we heard that the Archbishop did not even know about it because it had been removed by one of his employees and buried and he didn't even brief the Archbishop about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line815"><a name="pos815"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Was it said to you that it would not only be a foetus but also eight nails, about eight - if I remember correctly, about eight inches or ten inches long, would be driven into the ground?  What would that be a symbol for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line816"><a name="pos816"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I have no idea, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line817"><a name="pos817"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Digging nails into the ground.</p>
<p class="line" id="line818"><a name="pos818"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I have no idea.</p>
<p class="line" id="line819"><a name="pos819"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Did you ask?</p>
<p class="line" id="line820"><a name="pos820"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line821"><a name="pos821"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Might have had something to do with some foreboding of death?  Digging nails into the ground.</p>
<p class="line" id="line822"><a name="pos822"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I don't know, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line823"><a name="pos823"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Have you ever tried to find out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line824"><a name="pos824"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line825"><a name="pos825"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Who would know who this anthropologist was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line826"><a name="pos826"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> It should be Mr Verster.</p>
<p class="line" id="line827"><a name="pos827"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Or the operative from whom the project originated, it might have come from further down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line828"><a name="pos828"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Possibly, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line829"><a name="pos829"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Who was the Head of Region 9?</p>
<p class="line" id="line830"><a name="pos830"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I can't remember just like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line831"><a name="pos831"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> The performance of this act you told the Chairman, was when?</p>
<p class="line" id="line832"><a name="pos832"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He didn't know.  It's mentioned in the application, it's from mid-1989 to the end of the year but he didn't know and he also didn't know whether it was before or after the Early Learning Centre.</p>
<p class="line" id="line833"><a name="pos833"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> It was either the first or second thing that you were asked to approve?</p>
<p class="line" id="line834"><a name="pos834"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line835"><a name="pos835"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> You must have a very clear memory if it was one of the only two things that this complicated organisation did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line836"><a name="pos836"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, Chairperson, Region 6 is a small part of the CCB, the CCB had many operations and the Special Services had many projects.  It's not a clear recollection, I had a lot of other things to do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line837"><a name="pos837"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well I'm going to put to you that the only basis upon which this makes any sense is that which has been deposed to by Mr Barnard, which was consistent with the work of the CCB to eliminate people within the Republic of South Africa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line838"><a name="pos838"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line839"><a name="pos839"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And if anything was to intimidate Bishop Tutu, it would surely be the death of his son and more particularly if the cause of death was by poison use by what you call witch-doctors.</p>
<p class="line" id="line840"><a name="pos840"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, Chairperson, Mr Tutu was not a death target.</p>
<p class="line" id="line841"><a name="pos841"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Not the Bishop, his son.</p>
<p class="line" id="line842"><a name="pos842"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Neither his son.</p>
<p class="line" id="line843"><a name="pos843"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> I'm going on to another aspect, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line844"><a name="pos844"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I just want to ask a question before it slips my mind.  You say that the CCB was a small section of your command, can you just give us any idea of the size of the Security Forces personnel, how big was it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line845"><a name="pos845"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Chairperson, we had our Head Office in Pretoria, about a hundred people working there, then we went to Phalaborwa where there was a ground fighting element available for Special Forces, as well as pseudo capabilities, as well as a small reconnaissance group availability in Phalaborwa in the order of five hundred plus.  Then if we go to Durban, we had the parachute specialists with high jump low opening techniques, as well as sharp shooters, plus the hostage release team.  In Langebaan we had the sea specialist with regard to, with submarines, fleet ships or on their own capacities to reach targets, as well as all the support elements and there was a civil regiment as well.  So with all the support personnel, we're talking a thousand plus people, of which all the groups which I mentioned had different operations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line846"><a name="pos846"></a>	If we look at the CCB, Region 6 was the latest region, so it was only in the beginning stage.  The rest of the CCB was very active externally and they were well founded, well established, they functioned well and the internal part still had to find its feet, if you want.</p>
<p class="line" id="line847"><a name="pos847"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line848"><a name="pos848"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Mr Chairman, ...(indistinct - no microphone) Mr Verster.  You will find that he claimed privilege, at page 263 of the record, of the record of these proceedings and did not wish to answer any questions after consultation with my learned friend, Mr Wessels.  You'll see that on page 263 to 264.  This is why we haven't got from Mr Verster who the anthropologist who reported on this was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line849"><a name="pos849"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line850"><a name="pos850"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> I'm going onto another matter, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line851"><a name="pos851"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  We'll now take the lunch adjournment until 2 o'clock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line852"><a name="pos852"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line853"><a name="pos853"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line854"><a name="pos854"></a><span class="speaker">EDWARD WEBB:</span> (s.u.o.)</p>
<p class="line" id="line855"><a name="pos855"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Bizos.</p>
<p class="line" id="line856"><a name="pos856"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR BIZOS:</span> (cont)</p>
<p class="line" id="line857"><a name="pos857"></a>	Let us deal with the Early Learning Centre bomb incident, General.  You give us the precise date on which Mr Verster came to you, the 30th of September.</p>
<p class="line" id="line858"><a name="pos858"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line859"><a name="pos859"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Had you had any indication from him before this - in August was it, 30th of August.  Had you had any indication from him in your weekly meetings that this was being prepared?</p>
<p class="line" id="line860"><a name="pos860"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line861"><a name="pos861"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Now did you give you any explanation why you didn't have any forewarning, particularly as a bomb had to be obtained and it had to be doctored in relation to its explosive mechanism?  Did he give you any explanation as to why he came to you as a matter of such great urgency?</p>
<p class="line" id="line862"><a name="pos862"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line863"><a name="pos863"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> What did he say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line864"><a name="pos864"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> He told me that the meeting or the members would meet again on the 31st of August and that the information indicated that they would meet on the 31st and we didn't know when after that they would meet again, so we had to act either on the 31st of not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line865"><a name="pos865"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Did he explain why if in fact as we understand the other evidence, this was in preparation for some time, he hadn't forewarned you that a bomb was necessary?</p>
<p class="line" id="line866"><a name="pos866"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line867"><a name="pos867"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Who was your bomb maker, the CCB's bomb maker?</p>
<p class="line" id="line868"><a name="pos868"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> We didn't have a bomb maker.</p>
<p class="line" id="line869"><a name="pos869"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well to whom did you go if you needed a bomb to blow up something?</p>
<p class="line" id="line870"><a name="pos870"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> The Special Forces had first and second choice or option in respect of captured armaments and they had their own weaponry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line871"><a name="pos871"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes, who was the "Spesiale Magte persoon"?  You know we don't want these vague things.  People procured bombs to do things, we want to know as part of your duty to make full disclosure, who it was that provided this bomb, please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line872"><a name="pos872"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Chairperson, I only arranged for the remote control ignition device, not the limpet mine itself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line873"><a name="pos873"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well I am sure that you will tell us who gave you the explosive mechanism, the remote.</p>
<p class="line" id="line874"><a name="pos874"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Nobody gave it to me, I went to Col Hekkies van Heerden, he was my Engineering Officer and he therefore had control over the explosives and he then conveyed it to the CCB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line875"><a name="pos875"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> So we know that he got the remote.</p>
<p class="line" id="line876"><a name="pos876"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line877"><a name="pos877"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> What are his full names, what was his rank, where is he now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line878"><a name="pos878"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Unfortunately he died after leaving the Defence Force.</p>
<p class="line" id="line879"><a name="pos879"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Oh.  What was his job?</p>
<p class="line" id="line880"><a name="pos880"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> He was the Engineering Officer, the Technical Officer, and therefore he was in control of all my engineering capacity.  Engineering.</p>
<p class="line" id="line881"><a name="pos881"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Is a bomb an engineering function?</p>
<p class="line" id="line882"><a name="pos882"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes.  A mine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line883"><a name="pos883"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> A mine.  Did Mr Verster tell you what sort of explosive device he had prepared for this purpose?</p>
<p class="line" id="line884"><a name="pos884"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, he told that they would use a limpet mine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line885"><a name="pos885"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> In order to do damage to what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line886"><a name="pos886"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> To firstly frighten the people away and then also to damage the building.</p>
<p class="line" id="line887"><a name="pos887"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> How was he going to frighten them?  Did he explain to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line888"><a name="pos888"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes, we would explode the bomb immediately after the meeting, immediately after they'd left the hall and then they would get the message.</p>
<p class="line" id="line889"><a name="pos889"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> How would they know that it was you who had put the bomb there in order to be frightened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line890"><a name="pos890"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> They needn't know that it was us, Mr Bizos, they simply had to get the message that somebody is after them, that was the important thing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line891"><a name="pos891"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Who other than the Security Forces would have been on their track?</p>
<p class="line" id="line892"><a name="pos892"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> They wouldn't have been aware of the CCB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line893"><a name="pos893"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> I see, you thought that they may think that it was one of the other sabotage and killing agencies that might have done it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line894"><a name="pos894"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I don't know what they would have thought, the important thing was to get the message home to them, "Somebody is on your track, watch out."</p>
<p class="line" id="line895"><a name="pos895"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Oh, did you ask him who the owner of the building was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line896"><a name="pos896"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line897"><a name="pos897"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Did you ask him what purpose will this serve if none of them is injured, because they're going to meet somewhere else, under a tree, in a shebeen, in a cafe, in one's home?   Why damage property that didn't belong to them, that belonged to a religious trust that had made provision for the education of - yes, it wasn't a religious trust, it was trust with some religious people on its Board that had made provision for the education of children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line898"><a name="pos898"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Chairperson, the idea was to frighten them off, to give them a severe fright and that's why the bomb had to explode as soon as possible after they'd left the hall.  I suppose they could have met again under a tree or in a shebeen or wherever, but some of those people would have said "Look, I'm done with this, I'm not going to take part in this kind of thing."  Some of the more hardened people might have said "Yes, I'll continue."  But this kind of thing would have had a different effect on different people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line899"><a name="pos899"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Assume that they had their meetings in Sanlam buildings, would you have blown up Sanlam?</p>
<p class="line" id="line900"><a name="pos900"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Sanlam wouldn't have allowed that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line901"><a name="pos901"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> I beg your pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line902"><a name="pos902"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Sanlam would not have allowed such a thing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line903"><a name="pos903"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well but let's assume that one of their employees had access to the building and was abusing the privilege, let's assume that he was the Sanlam caretaker and an ANC underground worker, would you have blown up Sanlam?</p>
<p class="line" id="line904"><a name="pos904"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> It's possible, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line905"><a name="pos905"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> I beg your pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line906"><a name="pos906"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> It's possible, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line907"><a name="pos907"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Wouldn't you have gone to Sanlam and said "Hey, your premises are being abused"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line908"><a name="pos908"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> We didn't consider that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line909"><a name="pos909"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Why not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line910"><a name="pos910"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Because it was our plan to carry it out in this way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line911"><a name="pos911"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes, I know, but you know if you are telling the truth, which you are attesting here, you must be able to give rational reasons why you did something and why you didn't do other things in order to secure your purpose.  You and Mr van Zyl before you, whenever you're asked these questions, follow the same pattern "We did it because we did it, we are not prepared to debate with you why we did it and what other avenues were available to us."  Please try, if you want your version to be believed, to tell us why you didn't do the other things that are reasonable that I am suggesting.  It's not an answer to say "We did it this way because we did it this way."</p>
<p class="line" id="line912"><a name="pos912"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> We received information that it was to be in the Athlone hall and our information indicated that it was at Athlone hall, plus I was told that the source didn't want to reveal his identity and that's why for instance, we couldn't hand the matter over to the Police.  That alternative was not an option, and then I decided we were going to act.</p>
<p class="line" id="line913"><a name="pos913"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Now let us just take this step by step.  You needn't have told the Police the identity of the information in order to warn them that "These dangerous terrorists that meet over there, we have the names of some of them, we have a letter from one of them admitting it, follow them, search their houses, find explosives."  Why didn't you ask whether this was weighed before the proposal was made to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line914"><a name="pos914"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> If a member of the CCB was to approach the Police, the Police would ask you "But who are you, what's your business here?"  It would have simply blown the cover of the entire covert operation, so it couldn't work that way.  So the member who had the information couldn't even reveal his own identity.</p>
<p class="line" id="line915"><a name="pos915"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Was this information given to the Special Forces Information section in order to check it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line916"><a name="pos916"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, Chairperson, there was no time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line917"><a name="pos917"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> There was no time.  So that you are telling us that neither you nor anyone else checked it with the information department of the Special Forces?</p>
<p class="line" id="line918"><a name="pos918"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, the information came from the CCB and I accepted it as such.</p>
<p class="line" id="line919"><a name="pos919"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.  Now was it disclosed to you that the information came from a gangster?</p>
<p class="line" id="line920"><a name="pos920"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line921"><a name="pos921"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Would you have approved it if you were told that the information came from a gangster which wasn't checked by anybody?  Would you have approved it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line922"><a name="pos922"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> That was not the modus operandi of the CCB to tell me where they got the information from.</p>
<p class="line" id="line923"><a name="pos923"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> But were you a mere rubber stamp or did you have to exercise a discretion as to whether an offence would be committed against people or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line924"><a name="pos924"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I bona fide believed in what I did and I had a bona fide belief that what I approved and authorised was right in the circumstances.</p>
<p class="line" id="line925"><a name="pos925"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Answer the question please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line926"><a name="pos926"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Please repeat it then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line927"><a name="pos927"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Did you consider yourself merely a rubber stamp or did you have to satisfy yourself on the validity of the information that was placed before you and the necessity for it before you authorised crimes to be committed?  Were you a rubber stamp or did you have a discretion to exercise?</p>
<p class="line" id="line928"><a name="pos928"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Of course I had a discretion to say yes or no, and I said yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line929"><a name="pos929"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes, but did it have to be a "somer so nee of ja", or did it have to be an informed and reasoned "nee of ja"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line930"><a name="pos930"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> It was an informed and considered yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line931"><a name="pos931"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> I see, right.  So it had to be a reasoned decision, a decision on good and valid reasons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line932"><a name="pos932"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line933"><a name="pos933"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Otherwise you would not have approved it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line934"><a name="pos934"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line935"><a name="pos935"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Right.  Now you know, would you agree that military training or ...(indistinct) training possibly to a lesser extent, would be an inhibiting factor in too easily deciding whether a person or persons were really enemies of the State?</p>
<p class="line" id="line936"><a name="pos936"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line937"><a name="pos937"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> The opinion of a gangster would of necessity lack that - who lacked that background and training, would be very dangerous to rely on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line938"><a name="pos938"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line939"><a name="pos939"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And if you had been told that the information came from a gangster, you would not have approved it, you might have wanted to have confirmation of the facts?</p>
<p class="line" id="line940"><a name="pos940"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes, Chairperson, except I repeat, that was not the way the CCB operated, they didn't tell me where they got their information from.</p>
<p class="line" id="line941"><a name="pos941"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If you asked would they have told you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line942"><a name="pos942"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, Chairperson, because names even down to the lower ranks were not known to me, that was the modus operandi of the CCB and we stuck to that very closely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line943"><a name="pos943"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> You say it's the work of the CCB, you were the top of the pyramid of the CCB, General.</p>
<p class="line" id="line944"><a name="pos944"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> But would I ask ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line945"><a name="pos945"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Why do you distinguish between the CCB and yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line946"><a name="pos946"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I'm not making a distinction there, or ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line947"><a name="pos947"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> So you say this had nothing to do with me, the CCB was the - which shows that you distinguish yourself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line948"><a name="pos948"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, I said I that I approved the operation, so I'm not distancing myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line949"><a name="pos949"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes, but in giving evidence you say this was the CCB's work, not mine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line950"><a name="pos950"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Modus operandi, that's what I said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line951"><a name="pos951"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Now Mr Verster told us that you had channels of communication with the Police, contrary to what you tell us, who is telling us the truth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line952"><a name="pos952"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I had no channels of communication with the Police during my tenure.  I was never told of any contact person at the SAP.  For some or other reason he didn't exist anymore.</p>
<p class="line" id="line953"><a name="pos953"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> I'll repeat the question that the Chairman asked one of the previous witnesses.  If there was a letter of an admission that a person was responsible for acts of terror, it would have been an open and shut criminal case.  Was that letter shown to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line954"><a name="pos954"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line955"><a name="pos955"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Was any mention made of that letter in the report by Verster to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line956"><a name="pos956"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line957"><a name="pos957"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Now you describe the people that you wanted to frighten as a "bende", is that a gang?</p>
<p class="line" id="line958"><a name="pos958"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> A gang.</p>
<p class="line" id="line959"><a name="pos959"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Was the information given to you that the people that this was directed against were gangsters?</p>
<p class="line" id="line960"><a name="pos960"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> A gang committing acts of terror, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line961"><a name="pos961"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.  But in relation to the Western Cape and the people in the flats, a gang, does that mean that its membership consists of gangsters?</p>
<p class="line" id="line962"><a name="pos962"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I was told that it was a gang committing acts of terror.</p>
<p class="line" id="line963"><a name="pos963"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Usually the word "gang" refers to a group of people who commit crimes, not particularly political crimes, people who rob, deal in drugs, assault people, is that how you considered them, but they also participated in acts of a political nature, or did you in your own mind believe that they were a political group of people who committed political crimes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line964"><a name="pos964"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> That's correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line965"><a name="pos965"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well what ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line966"><a name="pos966"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Political, a group who were politically motivated to commit acts of terrorism, but the words were used "a gang" committing acts of terrorism.</p>
<p class="line" id="line967"><a name="pos967"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you didn't consider that they were a bunch of gangsters in the usual sense of the word, but who also indulged in political acts?</p>
<p class="line" id="line968"><a name="pos968"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line969"><a name="pos969"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> You see Mr Verster, before he was cross-examined by our colleague, Mr Williams before the Committee and before he asked the people to stand up and identify themselves and whether they look like gangsters to Mr Verster - oh yes, I'm correct, it was Mr Hockey that actually asked them to stand up - before that graphic demonstration took place, Mr Verster referred to them as a gang here in court, in the first sense of the word as used by the Chairman to you, you're not perhaps changing your evidence as a result of the embarrassment of Mr Verster, that these young people appear to be, from their occupations and their progress that they had made in life, as upstanding citizens and could hardly be described as gangsters?  You didn't change your evidence as a result of that little incident, did you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line970"><a name="pos970"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, Chairperson, we can look at my application, it's spelt out clearly there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line971"><a name="pos971"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> A gang?</p>
<p class="line" id="line972"><a name="pos972"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> A gang committing acts of terrorism.</p>
<p class="line" id="line973"><a name="pos973"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, Mr Bizos, I wonder if you could just help me.  My documents have only got the Tutu in bundle A, where - I've forgotten the reference?  Is it bundle B?</p>
<p class="line" id="line974"><a name="pos974"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> It's bundle D19.</p>
<p class="line" id="line975"><a name="pos975"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> D19, thank you.  Sorry to interrupt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line976"><a name="pos976"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes, it's on page 19.</p>
<p class="line" id="line977"><a name="pos977"></a>	You didn't consider referring it to the owner of the building, you didn't consider referring it to the Police, you didn't act for the verification of any information, you didn't ask for an explanation as to why they came so late, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line978"><a name="pos978"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> An explanation as to why they came so late?  What do you mean?</p>
<p class="line" id="line979"><a name="pos979"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> That they hadn't given you notice in order for you to check whether this is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line980"><a name="pos980"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I was informed of this on the 30th of August.  I was told what the circumstances were and that the next meeting would be on the 31st of August, it was confirmed, we didn't know when the next meeting was to take place, were we going to act, yes or no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line981"><a name="pos981"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you specifically requested for a remote control limpet mine or was that your idea, or how did that come about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line982"><a name="pos982"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, it was proposed by Col Verster that there should be no casualties and to avoid that we needed this remote control ignition device.</p>
<p class="line" id="line983"><a name="pos983"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Because is it correct that remote controlled limpet mines are not standard stock?</p>
<p class="line" id="line984"><a name="pos984"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line985"><a name="pos985"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> They usually use these lead burn through ...(indistinct) type detonation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line986"><a name="pos986"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes, and they're totally unreliable.</p>
<p class="line" id="line987"><a name="pos987"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So as it's been said, to get a remote controlled limpet mine there's got to be some doctoring or some adjustments.</p>
<p class="line" id="line988"><a name="pos988"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I organised for the remote control mechanism and something else would have to be added to put into the mine so that it could actually receive the necessary signal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line989"><a name="pos989"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Can I just ask something quickly while you're busy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line990"><a name="pos990"></a>	Mr Bizos just put to you that you didn't consider the Police, but actually you did consider the Police and the reason you didn't use the Police was because this person didn't want their identity revealed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line991"><a name="pos991"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes, I understood from Mr Bizos that we didn't approach the Police, but I was told that the source did not want his identity revealed and that's whey the Police could not be approached.</p>
<p class="line" id="line992"><a name="pos992"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> But who would you have approached if you had used the Police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line993"><a name="pos993"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I didn't have a contact.  Because I was told there would be no casualties, I said go ahead with the operation.  If people had died, then I would have had to launch entirely different operations afterwards.  But I couldn't pick up the phone and phone somebody of equal rank in the South African Police, I didn't have such a contact.</p>
<p class="line" id="line994"><a name="pos994"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So why was it even a consideration then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line995"><a name="pos995"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Because that's how it was told to me.  In other words, I couldn't even consider such a possibility.</p>
<p class="line" id="line996"><a name="pos996"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You see we were told that that was a possibility, that you could have approached the Police but this person didn't want their identity revealed.  You weren't told that there were letters and all sorts of other evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line997"><a name="pos997"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line998"><a name="pos998"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You weren't told they'd been working on this thing for over a month already?</p>
<p class="line" id="line999"><a name="pos999"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1000"><a name="pos1000"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Nothing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1001"><a name="pos1001"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1002"><a name="pos1002"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You didn't get a written presentation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1003"><a name="pos1003"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1004"><a name="pos1004"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> With a budget?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1005"><a name="pos1005"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1006"><a name="pos1006"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You didn't even approve a budget for this thing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1007"><a name="pos1007"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> The paperwork would have followed later.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1008"><a name="pos1008"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> What budget did you approve?  Sorry, Mr Bizos.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1009"><a name="pos1009"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I can't remember, I have to rely on what was said here, R30 000 or R15 000, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1010"><a name="pos1010"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> R30 000 for whom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1011"><a name="pos1011"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> That I don't know.  If I had approved a budget, it would have been a global amount.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1012"><a name="pos1012"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Now General, the fact that R30 000 was promised to a gangster for placing a bomb in an empty room in order to frighten people that had left, does that sound reasonable or excessive remuneration?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1013"><a name="pos1013"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> It sounds like it was very expensive to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1014"><a name="pos1014"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Now if that fact was disclosed to you, that "We are going to pay a gangster who gave us the information that I'm putting before you, who is merely going to put a bomb in the room", would you have approved the project?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1015"><a name="pos1015"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I'm sure I would have asked more question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1016"><a name="pos1016"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.  Would it - once the information came so expensively, would its accuracy have been doubted by you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1017"><a name="pos1017"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I do not follow your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1018"><a name="pos1018"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> If you were told that this gangster was going to be paid R30 000 for giving the information and for placing the bomb in an empty room after everyone had left, would that have made you doubt the accuracy of the information that was given to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1019"><a name="pos1019"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> In the first place, Chairperson, if I was told that it was a gangster I would have had serious questions, but that's not how it happened, that was not the procedure.  So you know, we can speculate and mention examples, but that's not what actually happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1020"><a name="pos1020"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> For the damage of property in which life might have been lost as a result of unforeseen circumstances, would you require to go above yourself for authorisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1021"><a name="pos1021"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> As long as there was to be no loss of life.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1022"><a name="pos1022"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> If there was a possibility of loss of life?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1023"><a name="pos1023"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Then yes, I would have had to seek higher authorisation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1024"><a name="pos1024"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And we know how often bombs placed in various places kill people who were not expected to be there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1025"><a name="pos1025"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> In this case it did not happen, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1026"><a name="pos1026"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes, I know, but it may be a matter of luck.  What I am asking is what you did not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1027"><a name="pos1027"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> It could also be a matter of skill.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1028"><a name="pos1028"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> A matter of?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1029"><a name="pos1029"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Skill.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1030"><a name="pos1030"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Skill.  And truthfulness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1031"><a name="pos1031"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1032"><a name="pos1032"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And responsibility?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1033"><a name="pos1033"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1034"><a name="pos1034"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Because Mr Burger said that if there was going to be any loss of life, it must be members of the Kewtown Committee.  That's what it is said was said to van Zyl.  Now if the supervisor of the district Committee thought that there was a possibility of loss of life but if there was it shouldn't be children or shouldn't be other people, but it would be preferable if they were members of the Kewtown Committee.  Now if he thought of it, why didn't you?  Please turn to page 40 ...(indistinct - no microphone)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1035"><a name="pos1035"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, your mike was off there, just repeat that again please, Mr Bizos.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1036"><a name="pos1036"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Bundle B, page 49, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1037"><a name="pos1037"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, just one question, Mr Bizos.  Sorry to keep interrupting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1038"><a name="pos1038"></a>	You said it was the modus operandi of the CCB not to give names etcetera, why would that be so, seeing that you were the Chairman and the boss?  Why, if you asked "Who supplied this information", why should somebody refuse that information to you?  Was there any reason for that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1039"><a name="pos1039"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I think the reason was as a result of the covert nature of the organisation.  The names were simply not revealed and pseudonyms were used.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1040"><a name="pos1040"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Bizos.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1041"><a name="pos1041"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> You see on page 40 - have you got it in front of you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1042"><a name="pos1042"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, I think if we can just get it on record, is this an extract from the Harms Commission Report?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1043"><a name="pos1043"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> No, this is a statement, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1044"><a name="pos1044"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is it?  Because if you go to page - oh, I've got the wrong one, no wonder.  Sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1045"><a name="pos1045"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> It's paragraph 78.  I don't want to read the first part because it's clear.  Just have a look, that</p>

And that that is authorised.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1052"><a name="pos1052"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Chairperson, just for the record, Mr Bizos is putting to the witness the Section 29 statement and I mentioned yesterday I don't want to keep on objecting to versions that were put because we'll be here for another five weeks and if do remain silent ...  That's not what I recall Mr van Zyl's evidence at these hearings was, what is read from the Section 29 statement.  But that's what I'm trying to avoid because we're going to have to sit here with the record every day if Mr Bizos wants to put versions.  This is the difficulty which we have, 'cause we're not computers and memorising word for word that was said after all these weeks.  So as far as I recollect, and that's the furthest I can take it, it was not Mr van Zyl's evidence.  He did say that - what I recall was that it was foreseen that there could be a possibility of injury or loss of life, but in terms of the words contained in the Section 29 statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1053"><a name="pos1053"></a>	The difficulty I'm having, Chairperson, is I don't want to object each time Mr Bizos tries to put a version because we're going to be here for days and I'm sure, Chairperson, you also have a difficulty trying to recollect and say "Well that's not really what the witness said."  That's the difficulty we have.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1054"><a name="pos1054"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, we can always of course check the record.  Mr Bizos.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1055"><a name="pos1055"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Not only does it accord with my recollection, Mr Chairman, but I'm assured by Mr Kahanovitz who was actually doing a planned and careful cross-examination as you will remember, with notes in front of him, that he actually asked him: "Is that what Staal Burger said to you?"  And he said "Yes" and I have a very clear recollection I think, of what the reaction of Mr Staal Burger was, sitting behind Mr van Zyl.  So Mr Martini will save time if he makes an objection based on facts.  But I don't want to take it any further.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1056"><a name="pos1056"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Chairperson, just for the record again, I don't want to continuously object, so I'm not going to and my failure to do so mustn't be regarded that we accept.  The problem which we have is, it's unfair to this witness if Mr Bizos is putting a wrong version.  That's the difficulty.  I don't want to prolong these proceedings but it's creating - I think it creates an unfairness to a particular witness, because at the end of the day we do have the record when we argue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1057"><a name="pos1057"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, we do have a record at the end of the day and I can assure you before we make any findings in respect of anything we will carefully go through the record and also the witness was also present the whole time during which Mr van Zyl was testifying, unlike in a court case, where he might not have been present.  So we do have the safety.  If the witness feels that that wasn't the situation or can't recall, then he can mention it himself as well.  If you feel that you ought to object, you can do so, but I can assure you the fact that you don't object to everything, we're not going to place any weight on the fact that you didn't object.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1058"><a name="pos1058"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> What I'm saying is, my silence mustn't mean I accept that's my client's version.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1060"><a name="pos1060"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> ...(indistinct) silence that will weigh, Mr Chairman, but the contents of the record.  He can be assured of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1061"><a name="pos1061"></a>	You see this passage here clearly indicates that it was part of the project, that means that it was authorised.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1062"><a name="pos1062"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> The instruction was that there would be no casualties.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1063"><a name="pos1063"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> No, we're talking about what was authorised and was not authorised.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1064"><a name="pos1064"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> But I'm telling you, the order was no casualties.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1065"><a name="pos1065"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Now you see I am going to suggest to you that the probabilities are overwhelming that there was an intention to wipe out the Kewtown Committee, and let me tell you why.  If the information that was given to you was correct, you were dealing with dangerous terrorists, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1066"><a name="pos1066"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, not dangerous terrorist, terrorists.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1067"><a name="pos1067"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well are there - well I'll leave out the dangerous, I suppose all terrorists are dangerous.  Are there any terrorists who are not dangerous?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1068"><a name="pos1068"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1069"><a name="pos1069"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Who?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1070"><a name="pos1070"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Those who did not participate in the struggle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1071"><a name="pos1071"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And who are they?  And who are they?  Please make your meaning clear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1072"><a name="pos1072"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I talk in general, Mr Bizos.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1073"><a name="pos1073"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> What is the "algemeen" mean?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1074"><a name="pos1074"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> That the persons who did not participate in the struggle were not dangerous terrorists.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1075"><a name="pos1075"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well they're not terrorists.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1076"><a name="pos1076"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> You get many people who talk but don't do much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1077"><a name="pos1077"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Oh I see.  Well perhaps your meaning is understood by some, but not by me.  But be that as it may, you were dealing with terrorists whom you expected to explode bombs before and during the election, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1078"><a name="pos1078"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1079"><a name="pos1079"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> They must therefore have had in their possession, on the probabilities, explosives and bombs ready or almost ready to go off.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1080"><a name="pos1080"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1081"><a name="pos1081"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> You expected them to use those bombs before or during that election, which was some six days away?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1082"><a name="pos1082"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1083"><a name="pos1083"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> How would giving them a fright after they had left, have prevented them from carrying on with their acts of terrorism?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1084"><a name="pos1084"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Some people have different characters, some people took up the armed struggle, others did not.  It's the same in this case.  When a bomb explodes, when you leave the building some people get the message very clearly and they would not join the organisation and continue with it.  Only the hardened people will say "Yes, let's continue."  But he would lose some of his people and then you disrupt him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1085"><a name="pos1085"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Did you think that these terrorists merely because their meeting place had been blown up in their absence, having gone to the danger of getting bombs, having gone to the danger of having exploded some of theme before, would have given up their purpose and not put up the - not make use of the bombs that they had?  Is that the logic in your argument?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1086"><a name="pos1086"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> It is not about blowing up the building, it's about the message the person would get after the explosion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1087"><a name="pos1087"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But I think, General, we heard evidence that they were believed to have blown up a bomb, I think it was at the Magistrate's Court, the Athlone Magistrate's Court ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1088"><a name="pos1088"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> The post office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1089"><a name="pos1089"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Post office ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1090"><a name="pos1090"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And the Magistrate's Court.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1091"><a name="pos1091"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ... and the Magistrate's Court, so it wasn't only anticipated that they were going to be starting their bombing campaign, they were already bombers, they had done bombs before.  One would think that they would have been believed by you to have been hardened.  I mean they've done it before, they've been brazen enough to put a bomb at the post office and the Magistrate's Court, now your information is that they're going to bomb again to disrupt the coming elections.  Okay so you put a bomb in the hall where they had a meeting and some of the people might leave because they don't want to get involved in this, it's now getting a bit hot and a bit heavy for them and they'll leave, but those ones that are hardened, they'd already done the bombing, that had planned to do the bombing, would carry on and do it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1092"><a name="pos1092"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> It's possible, but at that time we decided no casualties.  You must remember this is my first physical operation that I approved in Region 6.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1093"><a name="pos1093"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> You see put into the scale on the probabilities also that according to Mr van Zyl, Mr Verster said that if another bomb goes off, he will be held responsible, if you believed that they were responsible for letting off bombs, surely the only way in which you could guarantee that they wouldn't let bombs off in the near future for the election, was to wipe them out?  That would be the sure way.  Wouldn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1094"><a name="pos1094"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> That question you must ask Mr Verster, that's not what we discussed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1095"><a name="pos1095"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well yes, I think you were all in the same boat were you not?  You were all concerned, as misguided as some of you may have been, particularly in relation to these people that you were going to blow up, that on your thesis these were dangerous enemies of the State, why would you not want to blow them up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1096"><a name="pos1096"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> The idea came that there would be no casualties and that's what we went for - no casualties.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1097"><a name="pos1097"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes, the question was, why would you not want to blow them up if they were such - if they were terrorists and you believed that they were about to blow up places and people and candidates in particular?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1098"><a name="pos1098"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> That was the decision ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1099"><a name="pos1099"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Why wouldn't you want to blow them up in order to achieve your objectives of the CCB, as evidenced by the evidence of Mr Verster, the evidence of Mr van Zyl, on his briefing, the evidence of Exhibit L?  Why would you want to spare them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1100"><a name="pos1100"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> That's the decision we made.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1101"><a name="pos1101"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Ja, I know.  The question is, when I ask you to give reasons if you really want to motivate your reason, it is no answer to say "This is the decision we made."  We call it - you know we lawyers call it the ipse dixit, you know I said so, therefore don't ask me any more questions.  Can you give us any reasonable explanation as to why you would want to spare the lives of these terrorists?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1102"><a name="pos1102"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> All I can say, Chairperson, is this was my first approval of an operation of the CCB, possibly that also played a role.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1103"><a name="pos1103"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Can I just ask something, Mr Bizos.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1104"><a name="pos1104"></a>	Surely if you blew up their place that they met at, weren't you running the risk that you'd get them so angry they'd go and definitely plan more bombs in response, in retaliation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1105"><a name="pos1105"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> That's also a possibility, it can also happen, but for us the possibility was stronger that they would be frightened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1106"><a name="pos1106"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> But they were not the sort of people, they were the sort of people who plant bombs, that implies they're not easily frightened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1107"><a name="pos1107"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Well not all of them ...(indistinct) had planted bombs, it must have been some of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1108"><a name="pos1108"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> But you knew they'd planted at least two already, on the information you were given.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1109"><a name="pos1109"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> On the information I was given, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1110"><a name="pos1110"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So you know that's not the sort of people who are easily frightened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1111"><a name="pos1111"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Well that's the decision we made at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1112"><a name="pos1112"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> But you see the - I'm just trying to understand that if you weighed up all the odds and you knew who you were dealing with, why make a decision that's going to have almost no affect, based on what I've just said to you, for example.  You concede the likelihood of someone who is a bomb planter to desist from planting bombs just because you blow up his meeting place, it's hell of a small.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1113"><a name="pos1113"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Once again, people differ.  Let's say that the bomb planter is somebody who never felt that the police were watching him, he felt safe and suddenly he doesn't feel safe anymore, it has a great influence on him.  He might decide not to plant the bomb because somebody's watching him.  Psychologically it's very possible.  It's not just about the building, it was also that the bomb had to explode after the meeting so that the people would get the message.  If it exploded at 3 o'clock in the morning, there was no message, it was only a destroyed hall, it wouldn't mean anything.  If I was in a meeting and I am busy with terrorist acts and an hour or half an hour after I'd been there, there was a bomb, I'd ask myself "Maybe this was aimed against me."  It might change my ideas radically.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1114"><a name="pos1114"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> As a General, do you expect your orders or your wishes or your statements to be respected by your underlings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1115"><a name="pos1115"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1116"><a name="pos1116"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And did you make it crystal clear to Verster, that every possible step must be taken to avoid the loss of life?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1117"><a name="pos1117"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> All possible steps had to be taken.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1118"><a name="pos1118"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Now let's discuss the possibilities.  If Burger said this to van Zyl, Burger could only have got it from Verster, correct?  Because you had no direct contact with Burger.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1119"><a name="pos1119"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1120"><a name="pos1120"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> So that we would have had the situation that not only does Verster not take heed of what you said to him, but he communicated to Burger the opposite, who in turn communicated to van Zyl the opposite of what your order or wishes were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1121"><a name="pos1121"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Could you show me Col Verster's evidence that you now speak of, that he communicated that?  Where you read that there were allegations made by a third/fourth party, not Col Verster's evidence.  ...(transcriber's interpretation)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1122"><a name="pos1122"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> No, this is what ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1123"><a name="pos1123"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, no, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1124"><a name="pos1124"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Just listen to me please.  Burger could only have got it from Verster, if it went down the line, would you agree with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1125"><a name="pos1125"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1126"><a name="pos1126"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Otherwise Burger either made it up on his own and told van Zyl.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1127"><a name="pos1127"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> But what you read is a third/fourth party's evidence, that is not Slang van Zyl or Burger's evidence, it's not Joe Verster's evidence, so you start making allegations all the way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1128"><a name="pos1128"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> No but you see, we are trying to examine the probabilities of how this statement came to be made by Mr van Zyl, attributed it to Mr Burger, but let me put the gravamen of the question.  Let us assume that a couple of the Kewtown people were in fact killed, what would you have done about it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1129"><a name="pos1129"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I would have gone to higher authority to report this.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1131"><a name="pos1131"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I would have gone to higher authority, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1132"><a name="pos1132"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And what would you have done to Mr van Zyl that pushed the button, on one version, for the bomb to go off?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1133"><a name="pos1133"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I didn't know that he pushed the button.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1134"><a name="pos1134"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> No, but you surely would have made an enquiry if there was a loss of life ...(indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1135"><a name="pos1135"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Afterwards there would have been an investigation, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1136"><a name="pos1136"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes, what would you have done if there were a few lives lost and you knew that Mr van Zyl pressed the button?  What would you have done in relation to Mr van Zyl?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1139"><a name="pos1139"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> But I am telling you we would started an investigation, we would have acted according to higher orders.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1140"><a name="pos1140"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes, but he didn't carry out your instructions properly, there were loss of lives, what would you have done?  We know that people were injured, if people are injured it was just as likely that people may have been killed.  What would you have done to van Zyl if there had been a loss of life?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1141"><a name="pos1141"></a><span class="speaker">MR H DU PLESSIS:</span> Chairperson, how many times does Mr Bizos want the General to answer this question?  He would have reported it to higher authority, there would have been an investigation and he would have acted according to higher authorities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1142"><a name="pos1142"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes I think what Mr Bizos is getting at, if there was an investigation which established that your orders hadn't been properly followed, what would you have done to the operative?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1143"><a name="pos1143"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> It would have shown from the investigation what the circumstances were.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1156"><a name="pos1156"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I would have had a say after having seen the facts of the investigation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1157"><a name="pos1157"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Let us assume that one of the circumstances that Mr van Zyl placed before this Inquiry which you would have had, was "Well it's bad luck that there was loss of life, after all my District Manager, or Regional Manager told me that the project made provision for the loss of life as far as members of the Kewtown Youth Movement were concerned."  Assume that he said that, what would you have done or what would you have recommended should be done?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1158"><a name="pos1158"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> There would have been an investigation ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1159"><a name="pos1159"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> No, we're already had the "ondersoek" and ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1160"><a name="pos1160"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes, but that's another example for you, Mr Bizos, I'm busy with another investigation because you're ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1161"><a name="pos1161"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Chairperson, sorry.  Chairperson, if I may make a general statement here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1162"><a name="pos1162"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1163"><a name="pos1163"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> I don't want to interfere but I can't see the relevance of this line of questioning.  Factually in terms of the Act, the Act says the Commission must consider whether there's been a full disclosure of all the relevant facts, what is the relevance of what would have happened had someone died?  Factually we know no-one died.  And I make this general statement Chairperson, because I see we're in the third week now and there is a Section in the Act, Section 34, where the Commission may limit cross-examination in order to expedite proceedings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1164"><a name="pos1164"></a>	Now Chairperson, I'm making this statement since most of my learned colleagues here, we are from Johannesburg, we do not have the benefit of returning to chambers to do consultation work and catch up on chamber work and we've been here a long time and I think we should put some limit on the cross-examination, there should be some relevance to the cross-examination.  What would have happened to Mr van Zyl and Mr Botha had someone died, what is the relevance when we know?  Unless Mr Bizos can produced evidence that someone died with this explosion, then I can't see the relevance of this line of cross-examination.  This can take us here for another five weeks Chairperson, if we're going to carry on at this rate.  I think, Chairperson, you have the power within Section 34 to limit the cross-examination, really.  Otherwise I can see these proceedings continuing for months.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1165"><a name="pos1165"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> May I proceed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1166"><a name="pos1166"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well you see I think what's being get at here is with regard to the relevance.  We know we're dealing with supposition, we know that somebody didn't die but there is, certainly on the documents and between evidence that has been given here, the possibility of a contradiction relating to what the order was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1167"><a name="pos1167"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> But Chairperson, that can be argued.  This is not a fact.  The fact is no-one died, no-one was seriously injured and if Mr Bizos wants to argue that because we haven't come to the Commission - which I find an absurd argument, and stated that our intention was to kill and hence we shouldn't get amnesty, he must argue that.  But factually the Commission, the way I understand this Act, the Commission must have reference to relevant facts.  Now I would say a relevant fact is, "Did you or did you not blow up the Early Learning Centre?"  The General, the way I understand his evidence is, "I accept responsibility, I authorised it."   Mr van Zyl says "I pressed the button.  Do you want me to say I didn't press it?"  That's a relevant fact, but as to what may or may not have happened if someone had died, is totally irrelevant to these proceedings.  And this has been going on for a long, long time in these proceedings, we've allowed it with Mr van Zyl, it's now happening to Gen Webb and I'm sure it's going to happen with other witnesses.  I'm just trying to find a way to curtail the proceedings and, Chairperson, I do believe you have the power to limit this type of cross-examination.  Thank you, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1168"><a name="pos1168"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes Mr Bizos, I'm sure you're aware that time is of the essence and ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1169"><a name="pos1169"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Oh absolutely Mr Chairman, but the state of mind of the witness Mr Chairman, in relation to the authority given, is a vital matter for this and once we have the contradictory evidence which - one of the ways of testing whether he is telling the truth or not is to put this hypothesis to him, Mr Chairman.  It's a perfectly permissible way of cross-examining.  This is how probabilities are established, Mr Chairman.  Certainly in our training and in our practice I've had some experience in the running of trials, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1170"><a name="pos1170"></a>	Now the question was, had there been a death and there was an inquiry and Mr van Zyl said at that inquiry what he said in his statement and in his evidence, that "I was told by Mr Burger that if there were to be deaths, make sure that they are from the Kewtown Youth Movement", what would you have recommended to those above you should happen to Mr Burger or to Mr van Zyl, or both?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1171"><a name="pos1171"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> We would have had to find out whether such orders were given, it would have led to an investigation and it would have emerged, what happened etcetera.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1172"><a name="pos1172"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> But let us assume that this ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1173"><a name="pos1173"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> And after investigation, Mr Bizos, then we say that the following would be suggested, either the person would be retrenched or whatever.  That would have emerged from the investigation.  We did not have such an investigation, so I cannot tell you what we would have done.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1174"><a name="pos1174"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> What would he be charged with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1175"><a name="pos1175"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> With respect Mr Chairman, I want to associate myself with Mr Martini's objection.  We've been asked earlier here to give a date for this matter to proceed later on in the year.  We were told that the Commission must finish by October.  We've arranged for two weeks to carry on with this inquiry.  At the rate we're going on we will not finish in those two weeks and there are no other times available this year.  So the matter will then have to be postponed until next year and I don't believe that is in the interest of everybody, whether that can happen, but the speculation that goes on now cannot be relevant in any respect and I object formally to this type of cross-examination being admitted here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1176"><a name="pos1176"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes I think we must move on Mr Bizos, we've got the answer for that and we can go on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1177"><a name="pos1177"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> ...(indistinct - no microphone) we'll try.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1178"><a name="pos1178"></a>	What sort of election was there going to be according to your information, on the 6th of September?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1179"><a name="pos1179"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> It would have been an election, a municipal election if I remember correctly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1180"><a name="pos1180"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Not parliamentary?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1181"><a name="pos1181"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, as far as I remember it was a municipal election.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1182"><a name="pos1182"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Now who spoke to you about Khayelitsha?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1183"><a name="pos1183"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> You speak of what is in the application?  I had been briefed by Col Verster.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1184"><a name="pos1184"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> He didn't make any mention of it in his motivation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1185"><a name="pos1185"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> So?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1186"><a name="pos1186"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well it may well be that it didn't happen if there is a contradiction between you and him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1187"><a name="pos1187"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Well I say that it did happen, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1188"><a name="pos1188"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Mr van Zyl gave evidence ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1189"><a name="pos1189"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I beg your pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1190"><a name="pos1190"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Mr van Zyl gave evidence and he was the primary source of information to the CCB, he didn't mention it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1191"><a name="pos1191"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I don't think he was the primary source.  In his testimony ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1192"><a name="pos1192"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> No, the primary source ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1193"><a name="pos1193"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> ... he said that he received information through the information channels of the CCB.  He was not the primary source.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1194"><a name="pos1194"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> No, the prime source in the CCB.  I know that he got his information from Gakkie as a gangster, this is why I qualified it "in the CCB."  Mr van Zyl didn't say anything about a fire being started in Khayelitsha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1195"><a name="pos1195"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Mr van Zyl is not the only source of information in Region 6.  If I heard the evidence correctly, he would have gotten his information, he would have channelled it into the information channels of the CCB.  So there could have been input from other sources.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1196"><a name="pos1196"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Have you forgotten that you said that because of the supposed urgency of this it was not verified through any other channels?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1197"><a name="pos1197"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Did you forget that Mr Basson witnessed that they had been working on it for more than a month?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1198"><a name="pos1198"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes, so what does that prove?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1199"><a name="pos1199"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> It means that in a month it was in the pipeline.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1200"><a name="pos1200"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes, but all the information came from a gangster and that you say that it was not verified independently of that, because of the urgency.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1201"><a name="pos1201"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> The urgency yes, because the meeting was on the 31st and we had to make a decision on the 30th, do we act, yes or no?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1202"><a name="pos1202"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Did you ask any questions whatsoever about the background of the "bron", of the source of the information?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1203"><a name="pos1203"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1204"><a name="pos1204"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Did you understand that his identity was not even known to operatives of the CCB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1205"><a name="pos1205"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> That's normal practice in the CCB, that the people do not know their names.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1206"><a name="pos1206"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> So you thought that van Zyl got this from an unknown or unidentified person?  Unknown person to him, is that what it meant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1207"><a name="pos1207"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, I say a source would not reveal his identity.  That was conveyed to me.  Who the source was I do not know, on which level the source was I do not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1208"><a name="pos1208"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> The person who is the expert who went there says that it appeared to him that more than one bomb may have been used.  The evidence will also be that after the explosion the place was full of scrap of metal, broken and twisted metal all over the place.  What sort of limpet mine did you think was being used?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1209"><a name="pos1209"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> According to my knowledge you get only one kind of limpet mine, it's a Russian mine and the aim of a limpet mine is to cause fire and it is used against fuel tanks and maybe also against ships.  It's not a shrapnel bomb.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1210"><a name="pos1210"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I'm not an expert General, but I've been listening to many, many applications and I know that there's at least two types of limpet mines.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1211"><a name="pos1211"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> A smaller one and a bigger one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1212"><a name="pos1212"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1213"><a name="pos1213"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Ja, there are two but the limpet mine's objective still remains the same.  The main object of a limpet mine is to cause fire.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1214"><a name="pos1214"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Was this a small one or a bigger one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1215"><a name="pos1215"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1216"><a name="pos1216"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Didn't you ask what the size was going to be?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1217"><a name="pos1217"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1218"><a name="pos1218"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> If the primary purpose of a limpet mine was to start a fire, there was a possibility amounting to a probability that his place would be destroyed by fire.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1219"><a name="pos1219"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> It's a possibility, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1220"><a name="pos1220"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> So this would have been tremendous damage to the owners of this property and the burning of a facility which catered for the community, including nursery school children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1221"><a name="pos1221"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Chairperson, I had no knowledge that there was a nursery school or what the hall looked like and who all used it, according to me it was about a hall in Athlone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1222"><a name="pos1222"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It wasn't described to you as the Early Learning Centre, which we know it's called?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1223"><a name="pos1223"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Not at that stage, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1224"><a name="pos1224"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> On the assumption that there will be evidence of these inordinate number of pieces of twisted shrapnel all over the place, you say that it couldn't have been done by an un-doctored, unmodified limpet mine?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1225"><a name="pos1225"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I don't know anything about the construction of the roof.  That could have caused shrapnel.  I don't know anything about the construction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1226"><a name="pos1226"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Sorry, Chairperson, we were promised originals of the photographs which appear at the back of bundle B, would it be possible to get these original photographs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1227"><a name="pos1227"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ms Coleridge, have you got that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1228"><a name="pos1228"></a><span class="speaker">MS COLERIDGE:</span> Chairperson, I have requested for persons to locate it and I haven't received it as such, but I'll attend to ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1229"><a name="pos1229"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes will you follow that up please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1230"><a name="pos1230"></a><span class="speaker">MS COLERIDGE:</span> Definitely.  Chairperson, we know that the Early Learning Centre's got a lot of pictures there as well.  I just want to check whether that would be suitable.  I know Mr Martini had seen those pictures at the - whether we could use those pictures as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1231"><a name="pos1231"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well any photographs of the scene would help.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1232"><a name="pos1232"></a><span class="speaker">MS COLERIDGE:</span> Thank you, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1233"><a name="pos1233"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Bizos.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1234"><a name="pos1234"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Was there any plan at any time to your knowledge, that a bomb should be used and that nails should be wrapped around it for the purposes of doing maximum damage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1235"><a name="pos1235"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1236"><a name="pos1236"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Now I know that it is hearsay, but I must put it to you and you'll say that it's hearsay upon hearsay, but it does not matter for my purposes at this stage but I must put to you what one of the persons associated with the CCB, of which you were the Head, said at bundle B page 131, Mr Chairman.  Will you please read the bottom of page 130.</p>

I had to look for a Coloured man Isgak, and make contact with him.  I found Isgak at the Basement night-club and befriended him.  He later gave me a contact number in Woodstock.  I gave it to Louie.  I was curious about the order and asked Louie about it."</blockquote>

He said a certain Oliver usually attended the meetings and that they wanted him dead.  He said that they to destroy the whole meeting hall.

<p class="line" id="line1253"><a name="pos1253"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Right.  Now what do you say in relation to the policy of the CCB about killing people and mass?  The number of people with one bomb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1254"><a name="pos1254"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> This was the first bomb planted by the CCB, so I don't know what mass bombs you're referring.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1265"><a name="pos1265"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Would you agree that it can have a devastating affect on people that happen to be in the room?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1266"><a name="pos1266"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Our previous enemies use it like that, it's a very effective way to make an ordinary mine an anti-personnel mine.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1270"><a name="pos1270"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> I mean it's a fairly well known way of increasing the effectiveness of handgrenades and mines and all sorts of other explosive devices.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1271"><a name="pos1271"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> It is to boost the anti-personnel capacity.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1275"><a name="pos1275"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS(?):</span> Mr Chairman, perhaps just to stop the speculation we should refer to the statement by Mr Pieter Steenkamp in the same bundle, wherein I can find no traces that - he certainly did not state that he found nails etcetera.  What he did find he calls "vermoedelik" part of the limpet mine.  He doesn't say that he found any nails on the scene.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1277"><a name="pos1277"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> Mr Chairman, may we hear who those witnesses are, because we are entitled to know what witnesses will give evidence and what the allegations are against us.  That is not only what was agreed at the pre-trial meeting, but that it also in terms of the administrative law as I understand it.  So if Mr Bizos intends calling witnesses who will say that, let him tell us who that witness is going to be and what he's going to say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1278"><a name="pos1278"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It's not unfair that.</p>

I am not prepared to disclose their names or the effect of the evidence of these people, I merely want to put to the witness that this was done and he has given evidence.  I am not - it's not a trial where I have to say specifically who is going to do what.  We had an inspection in loco, I have had discussions with people who were there shortly after the event and we will take statements and we will submit them in due course.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1281"><a name="pos1281"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.  Mr Chairman, in due course it will be.  In due course it will be.  The information came to my notice Mr Chairman, at the time of the inspection in loco, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1282"><a name="pos1282"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> As long as there's a reasonable notice.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1283"><a name="pos1283"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Oh yes of course, Mr Chairman, we will not take anybody by surprise.  We have had certain consultations, we are not ready to - we have been busy with this, we have completed our work, but they will be the first to know, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1284"><a name="pos1284"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Mr Chairman, I'm sure that will be - I suppose that will be the local Athlone bomb expert, because we have a statement by a bomb expert who was at the scene shortly after the explosion, in this bundle B.</p>

Mr Chairman, in relation to who Louie was, I merely want to refer to bundle B on pages 93 to 94 in which Mr Barnard indicates - 94 to 95, indicates that Louie was van Zyl, Mr Chairman.  No, Mr Chairman what he says is by inference, he says that - well you'd better say what he says, because I'm getting conflicting ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1286"><a name="pos1286"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Mr Chairman, can I just clarify the situation?  Mr Barnard made an earlier statement and a subsequent statement.  In the earlier statement he says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1287"><a name="pos1287"></a>"I blamed certain things on Louie."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1288"><a name="pos1288"></a>Louie is the codename for someone by the name of Lafras Luitingh, who was his handler.  In the subsequent statement at the page reference Mr Bizos referred you to, he says:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1289"><a name="pos1289"></a>"Where I refer to the Early Learning Centre bomb incident I want to tell you I want to correct the situation.  The source of the information that I had was not Louie, alias Lafras Luitingh, my source of information was Slang van Zyl."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1290"><a name="pos1290"></a>That's what he says.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1291"><a name="pos1291"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In the statement?  This is B94 and 95?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1292"><a name="pos1292"></a><span class="speaker">MR KAHANOVITZ:</span> Yes, that is the subsequent statement in which he says he wishes to correct himself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1293"><a name="pos1293"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Did you question why the bomb was not put into - what time and at what place it was going to be put in order to avoid any possibility of injury or death?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1294"><a name="pos1294"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1295"><a name="pos1295"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> If you were told that there was going to be a meeting between seven and nine and that on apparently doubtful information the bomb was let off at 8.30, would you have approved of it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1296"><a name="pos1296"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> The project had been approved, the people on the ground had the final say as to what happened or not and they made the final decision.  I couldn't sit in Pretoria and say "Activate the bomb at a certain time", because the people on the ground could see what was happening and they reacted accordingly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1297"><a name="pos1297"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Who reported to you that there were people who were injured?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1298"><a name="pos1298"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I think it was Col Verster.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1299"><a name="pos1299"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> If my memory serves me correctly, both Mr van Zyl and Mr Verster in their statements said that there was no-one injured.  Can you explain that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1300"><a name="pos1300"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, it was reported to me that there were certain injuries.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1301"><a name="pos1301"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you have any further questions, Mr Bizos?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1302"><a name="pos1302"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman, I'm looking through my notes.  If you would just give me a moment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1303"><a name="pos1303"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> General Webb, was it ever said that the purpose of placing the bomb in the hall was to make it appear that it was by the organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1304"><a name="pos1304"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1305"><a name="pos1305"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You see we were told that was the reason why it had to go off reasonably soon after the meeting, so that it would point directly at the people who held the meeting and that it could be construed that they were responsible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1306"><a name="pos1306"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1307"><a name="pos1307"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> That was never part of anything that you ever heard at that time?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1314"><a name="pos1314"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR WILLIAMS:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1315"><a name="pos1315"></a>	General Webb, do I understand your testimony correct that Mr Verster came to you, he discussed the Early Learning project with you, he wanted your permission for that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1316"><a name="pos1316"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1317"><a name="pos1317"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> You could give your permission, you could either say yes or no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1318"><a name="pos1318"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1319"><a name="pos1319"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> You authorised this project on the basis of certain information that was supplied to you, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1320"><a name="pos1320"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1321"><a name="pos1321"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> Now you are the only applicant that states in your application that the Kewtown youth were going to start a fire in Khayelitsha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1322"><a name="pos1322"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I didn't see the applications of the other applicants.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1323"><a name="pos1323"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> Ja, but you've heard the testimony of Mr Slang van Zyl who as Mr Bizos indicated, was the primary source within your organisation who collated this information.  Would you accept as a fact that this information was incorrect?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1324"><a name="pos1324"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Mr Slang van Zyl was not the only source of information.  Slang van Zyl gathered intelligence on the ground, conveyed that to the CCB intelligence bodies and there could have been different input into that channel.  Must I explain it again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1325"><a name="pos1325"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> General Webb, but if I understand Mr van Zyl's evidence correct, then it is that he never received information that the Kewtown Youth Movement were going to start a fire in Khayelitsha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1326"><a name="pos1326"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> But I think what the General's saying - correct me if I'm wrong, General, is that Mr van Zyl would get some evidence from the ground, he would relay it through his channels, it would end up with the intelligence people in the CCB, who would then do their own work and there might be sources coming from that side.  Is that what you're saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1327"><a name="pos1327"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> That's correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1328"><a name="pos1328"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Without even Mr van Zyl knowing.  Other information.  That's what I understood the answer to be.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1329"><a name="pos1329"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> Now General Webb, I put it to you that the Kewtown youth never intended to start a fire in Khayelitsha.  It sounds ridiculous to us even.  Would you accept that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1330"><a name="pos1330"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> You can put it me, but please bring me the evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1331"><a name="pos1331"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> No, but are you prepared to accept if I tell you, or if I put it to you that we had no such intentions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1332"><a name="pos1332"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> But Mr Williams, you're not testifying.  Please.  You can't tell me to just accept it.  If you are prepared to give evidence then do so.  If we get to the end of these proceedings and my information was incorrect, then I will concede that, but there has been no evidence as yet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1333"><a name="pos1333"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think that's a situation where it would impossible for the witness to accept it or deny it and he just can't dispute whatever is put to him in that regard.  Isn't that the situation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1334"><a name="pos1334"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> Ja okay, let me go onto the next point then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1335"><a name="pos1335"></a>	I think also you are the only applicant who said that:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1336"><a name="pos1336"></a>"We planned attacks on the lives of candidates who stood for the election."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1337"><a name="pos1337"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I say once again I didn't read the other applications.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1338"><a name="pos1338"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> Now my understanding of the other applications is that the Kewtown youth planned to disrupt the elections by planting bombs at the venues etcetera, but not on the lives of candidates.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1339"><a name="pos1339"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> That was the information which I got.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1340"><a name="pos1340"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> Now I put it to you that that is also incorrect and that is not the truth.  Are you prepared to accept that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1341"><a name="pos1341"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Once again, you're not giving evidence ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1342"><a name="pos1342"></a><span class="speaker">MR H DU PLESSIS:</span> Chairperson, could we please just make a distinction here.  Is Mr Williams saying that the Kewtown Youth Movement would not have done it, or is he saying that the information which the General had was incorrect?  Please let us just be clear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1343"><a name="pos1343"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think it's clear Mr Williams, when you're questioning him that there - the General was in Pretoria and worked on information, so if you put it to him whether the Kewtown youth wouldn't burn, or would he accept that they wouldn't burn Khayelitsha or kill people, what can he say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1344"><a name="pos1344"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1345"><a name="pos1345"></a>	Then General, are you saying as a fact that that was the information that you received?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1346"><a name="pos1346"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> That is the information which I received.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1347"><a name="pos1347"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> And that is from Mr Verster?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1348"><a name="pos1348"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1349"><a name="pos1349"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> And also the other information that you received was that we that we planned to - that we were involved in bomb attacks?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1350"><a name="pos1350"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> That's the information which I received.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1351"><a name="pos1351"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> Now also that - you've already testified that you have never received information, that you were never informed that gangsters supplied the information to Mr Slang van Zyl.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1352"><a name="pos1352"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1353"><a name="pos1353"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> Now General I find it strange that you are saying that Mr Verster supplied you with some of the information, whereas Mr Verster never said that in his - that was never his testimony before this Committee.  For example he never says that he received information that we planned attacks on the lives of candidates who stood for the elections.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1354"><a name="pos1354"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> That is my evidence, that's the information which I received.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1355"><a name="pos1355"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> But can you explain to the Committee why that is not the testimony of Mr Verster?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1356"><a name="pos1356"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Let's look at Mr Verster's application, let's see what he says about that and what reasons he gives.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1357"><a name="pos1357"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> You were here when he testified, you listened to his testimony.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1358"><a name="pos1358"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1359"><a name="pos1359"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> He never said that we planned attacks on the lives of candidates.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1360"><a name="pos1360"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I don't know, I can't remember.  Bring us the application, let us see what the application states black on white.  Let's not rely on our memory.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1361"><a name="pos1361"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> We can do that tomorrow morning.  General Webb, would you agree with me that if people were to stand up today and say that we were part of the armed struggle, we were part of planting bombs etcetera, and attacking venues and elections, that that type of statement would stand them in good stead in the new South Africa?  Would you agree with that statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1362"><a name="pos1362"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, it wouldn't stand them in good stead.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1366"><a name="pos1366"></a>have played a significant part in the, or a significant role in contributing to the demise of apartheid.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1367"><a name="pos1367"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> After eleven years it will be somewhat difficult.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1368"><a name="pos1368"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> No, but would you just agree with me that if a person says "Look I was involved in the armed struggle", that that could possibly be a window of opportunity to entering the civil service or to obtaining certain ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1369"><a name="pos1369"></a><span class="speaker">MR H DU PLESSIS:</span> Chairperson, what is the relevance of this line of questioning?  We really are wasting a lot of time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1370"><a name="pos1370"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Whether the General agrees with that proposition or not, it won't affect your argument will it, Mr Williams?  I can see what point you're getting at, that ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1371"><a name="pos1371"></a><span class="speaker">MR H DU PLESSIS:</span> And maybe evidence should then be obtained from the government whether in fact that is the criteria these days if a person is appointed to the civil service.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1372"><a name="pos1372"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you're trying to just extract an opinion from the General on something that he might be wrong about?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1400"><a name="pos1400"></a><span class="speaker">MS COLERIDGE:</span> Thank you General, that's fine.  So are you saying that you gave direct instructions to Mr Joe Verster in relation to the Desmond Tutu incident?  That's the Apie foetus.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1401"><a name="pos1401"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I approved it, I approved the project.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1402"><a name="pos1402"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think the question was, did you approve the project to Mr Verster.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1409"><a name="pos1409"></a><span class="speaker">MR H DU PLESSIS:</span> Chairperson, may I just get clarity here.  Ms Coleridge has just said that Mr Verster did not apply for amnesty in respect of the baboon foetus and now it's expected of this witness to comment on something for which there isn't even an application before the Commission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1410"><a name="pos1410"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, and the reason why he didn't apply, that's his own reason.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1411"><a name="pos1411"></a><span class="speaker">MS COLERIDGE:</span> I take the point, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1412"><a name="pos1412"></a>	In relation to the CCB activities, when did it come to a halt?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1413"><a name="pos1413"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> End of '89, early in 1990.  I don't have a specific date, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1414"><a name="pos1414"></a><span class="speaker">MS COLERIDGE:</span> And when did you leave the CCB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1415"><a name="pos1415"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I was put on leave early in 1990.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1416"><a name="pos1416"></a><span class="speaker">MS COLERIDGE:</span> And were there discussions relating to the CCB early in 1990 with the Chief of the Defence Force, etcetera, the Army, regarding activities of the CCB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1417"><a name="pos1417"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> There was an enquiry, an investigation and the results of that enquiry was submitted to higher authority.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1418"><a name="pos1418"></a><span class="speaker">MS COLERIDGE:</span> Sir, would you be able to say that the CCB activities definitely came to a stop during 1990?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1419"><a name="pos1419"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1420"><a name="pos1420"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Either late '89 or during 1990.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1421"><a name="pos1421"></a><span class="speaker">MS COLERIDGE:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1422"><a name="pos1422"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> All operational activities were halted.  That is what I was told, I don't know if it's correct but there were certain businesses and entities which still had to be dissolved, but the operational things all stopped.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1423"><a name="pos1423"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But after you were put on leave in 1990, you didn't go back to your post, did you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1424"><a name="pos1424"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> For a short period yes, and then I was transferred to another section.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1425"><a name="pos1425"></a><span class="speaker">MS COLERIDGE:</span> Thank you, Chairperson, I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1426"><a name="pos1426"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS COLERIDGE</p>
<p class="line" id="line1427"><a name="pos1427"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> Mr Chairman, may I ask a question as a result of the cross-examination by Mr Bizos, which I want to deal with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1428"><a name="pos1428"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Certainly, Mr Wessels.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1429"><a name="pos1429"></a><span class="speaker">FURTHER CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR WESSELS:</span> General, you testified that the members of the CCB were subject to military code or the Defence Act, and that they could be arraigned before a Military Court.  I want to put it to you that you're wrong in that respect and that all CCB members had to resign, officially resign from the Defence Force and their involvement in the CCB was obtained by means of a contract based on a personnel plan which was drafted.  Are you aware of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1430"><a name="pos1430"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1431"><a name="pos1431"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> And it is on that basis which the relationship was regulated as between the Defence Force and the authorities and that specific member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1432"><a name="pos1432"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1433"><a name="pos1433"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> So that should a person transgress the code, it wouldn't be necessary to have a or a Court Martial, but he could immediately be dismissed by Mr Verster, as in fact happened in the case of Botes and Mr Burger - not Burger, Barnard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1434"><a name="pos1434"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> That is true. I was under the impression that they were still under the military regime, but my impression was possibly entirely incorrect as a result of the CCB part.  Because there was also for instance, Mr Corrie Meerholtz who was at the CCB, but he went back, now I don't know whether he went through the entire process by resigning his rank etcetera, etcetera, but he was for instance a member of the CCB and then went back to Special Forces.  In the case of Mr Verster, I heard last time we were here that he actually resigned his commissioned rank and in that case he would not have been able to resort under military discipline.  I thought the CCB fell under this military discipline.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1435"><a name="pos1435"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I take it you didn't resign your rank or anything of that nature?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1436"><a name="pos1436"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1437"><a name="pos1437"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You stayed on as General.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1438"><a name="pos1438"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> I have no further questions, thank you.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1442"><a name="pos1442"></a>	...(inaudible), Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1443"><a name="pos1443"></a>	General Webb, if I understand your testimony correctly, then it's that CCB operatives could engage in acts of murder but before they do that they needed authorisation, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1444"><a name="pos1444"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1445"><a name="pos1445"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> You yourself could not give authorisation for an act of murder, you had to consult with someone higher up before you could do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1446"><a name="pos1446"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1447"><a name="pos1447"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> And by implication Col Verster could also not give authorisation for a conspiracy to murder or an attempt to murder or something in that regard, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1448"><a name="pos1448"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1449"><a name="pos1449"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> Now you've also testified yesterday that before a person burnt out a vehicle, they need your authorisation and you would also consult higher up, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1450"><a name="pos1450"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1451"><a name="pos1451"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, I don't think so.  My understanding was that the only type of operation that didn't need the authority of the general was monitoring, every other operation involving damage to property or killing etcetera, had to go through Gen Webb, but if it was killing, then he himself had to go higher.  So to damage a vehicle or throw a stone through a window, that sort of thing could stop at the level of Gen Webb.  Is that correct, General?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1452"><a name="pos1452"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1453"><a name="pos1453"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> Mr Chairperson, I agree with what you've said now but I think the witness had also testified ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1454"><a name="pos1454"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well put it to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1455"><a name="pos1455"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> At some point you also testified yesterday that before they could burn a vehicle out or something, you would have sought ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1456"><a name="pos1456"></a><span class="speaker">MR H DU PLESSIS:</span> Chairperson, Mr Williams is a bit confused.  You will recall that, I think it was either before the Harms Commission or the Webster Inquest, the General testified that he couldn't even give authorisation for the burning of a vehicle, but he told you here that that was not correct.  That he had the powers over things like that.  I think that's where Mr Williams got if from, but he's confused.  He said that the evidence given before that body was incorrect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1457"><a name="pos1457"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry.  The only other gloss on your instructions as I understood it, was that if it was a high profile person the monitoring required your approval as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1458"><a name="pos1458"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1459"><a name="pos1459"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Well you said they came to you about Lubowski because it was a high profile person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1460"><a name="pos1460"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes, but it was in the newspapers, it was something which was generally and commonly known, "Lubowski's coming to South Africa, let's monitor him."  And in that way Joe and I discussed that, but my approval was not needed and each monitoring action wasn't reported to me.  But this was something which was made quite a fuss of in the media.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1461"><a name="pos1461"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So the monitoring of other high profile people didn't require your permission?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1462"><a name="pos1462"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1463"><a name="pos1463"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> Then your evidence is also to the effect that you've never openly discussed these matters with Mr Verster, you've never told him that, for example in the instance where the plan to murder someone, they need your permission or you need to consult with people higher up than yourself?  You've never had a formal discussion in this regard with Mr ...(indistinct)?  Was that your evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1464"><a name="pos1464"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Mr who?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1465"><a name="pos1465"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> Verster.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1466"><a name="pos1466"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I don't follow the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1467"><a name="pos1467"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you ever have a formal ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1468"><a name="pos1468"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, my evidence was in relation to Gen Joubert, that the two of us never spoke about assassination.  That was what I said, I didn't say anything about Col Verster.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1469"><a name="pos1469"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> Ja, but did Col Verster know that he had to consult you or seek your permission before he could, for example, conspire to murder somebody?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1470"><a name="pos1470"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Col Verster was a founder member of the CCB, he knew the procedure better than I did myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1471"><a name="pos1471"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Can I just ask something?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1472"><a name="pos1472"></a>	Did he know that he had to - did he know that you had to go up to the next level to get permission to kill someone?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1473"><a name="pos1473"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> It's possible that he knew that, possibly not.  Look, he was in the CCB for much longer than myself, he knew the procedures very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1474"><a name="pos1474"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Well you don't know whether he knew it or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1475"><a name="pos1475"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1476"><a name="pos1476"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You didn't even discuss it with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1477"><a name="pos1477"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, but if such a thing did happen I would have told him "Look I have to seek higher authority", but such a case didn't eventuate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1478"><a name="pos1478"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Was Gen Joubert also required to go up to seek authority in an event of a mission?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1479"><a name="pos1479"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Gen Joubert?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1480"><a name="pos1480"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1481"><a name="pos1481"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I don't know exactly what his instructions were but those were mine.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1485"><a name="pos1485"></a><span class="speaker">MR H DU PLESSIS:</span> Chairperson, the question has already been asked ad nauseam, Mr Williams must please not repeat those questions, we are under time constraint.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1486"><a name="pos1486"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> Okay I'll leave it at that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1487"><a name="pos1487"></a>	Were you at the time aware that Mr Lubowski was being monitored?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1488"><a name="pos1488"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1489"><a name="pos1489"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> Were you - at the time when he was monitored, were you aware at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1490"><a name="pos1490"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1491"><a name="pos1491"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> Were you consulted prior to the monitoring of Mr Lubowski?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1492"><a name="pos1492"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> No, I wasn't consulted prior to the monitoring.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1493"><a name="pos1493"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> So at what stage did you become aware that he was being monitored?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1494"><a name="pos1494"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> There were newspaper reports which said that Mr Lubowski was coming to visit South Africa and I read it and Mr Verster read it and we then got together and we discussed Mr Lubowski's visit and we then said "Let's monitor him" and I said "Yes, that's fine."</p>
<p class="line" id="line1495"><a name="pos1495"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> Now you testified before this Commission that the purpose why he was being monitored was to see what contacts he had inside South Africa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1496"><a name="pos1496"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1497"><a name="pos1497"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> Did you follow that up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1498"><a name="pos1498"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I said that I got feedback afterwards that there was nothing untoward, nothing could be uncovered which hadn't already been known.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1499"><a name="pos1499"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> Can you tell the Committee where he came to in South Africa?  Who did he go visit, where did he stay, what did he do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1500"><a name="pos1500"></a><span class="speaker">GEN WEBB:</span> I know he came to Cape Town and Johannesburg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1501"><a name="pos1501"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> Who did he go and see there, do you have an idea?</p>

Mr Chairperson, I'm going to ask that we adjourn now and that I be given an opportunity just to reassess my questions, Mr Chairperson.  I promise I won't be long tomorrow morning but I do want an opportunity to at least put some questions to this witness and to make some statements to him.  It was past four Mr Chairperson.</p>
