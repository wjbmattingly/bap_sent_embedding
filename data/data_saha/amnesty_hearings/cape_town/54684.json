Schools were burnt down, vehicles were burnt, police vehicles were burnt out and black police members had their homes attacked.  Delivery vehicles entering the black areas were robbed, burnt and the beer halls belonging to the administration boards were totally burnt down and robbery took place there as well.\n\tThe riots started as a result of the fact that Afrikaans was the medium of instruction as part of the so-called Bantu Education policy, and it was a defiant action against the Education system of the State and it led to total anarchy.   Everything was orientated towards black power at that stage, and the ANC and the SACP played a very minimal role at that stage.\n\tBlack power was at that stage the leading internal revolutionary organisation.  \n\tThe situation escalated and people who had done certain building operations to their homes, found that their homes were also attacked and burnt because the inference was drawn that those people had to have received money from the State to be able to build and renovate their homes.\n\tInnocent people were burnt, and their homes attacked, there was a total boycott and that spilt over right down to 1978 after the banning of all black power organisations, BPC, SASO and all related organisations.",

Questions were indeed put to him, he was confronted for instance with the inflammatory pamphlets.\n\tThe pamphlet doesn't say how people were killed, but reference were made to people being killed, and that was all part of the conflict of the past.  So, you can't argue in the way that Mr Bizos is, to say that just because there was a bomb, there was no conflict in the past.  No, what about acts of sabotage?\n\tThe people had not yet left the country at that stage, they hadn't yet had the opportunity to complete their training and come back and plant bombs.  What could they use, they had to manufacture petrol bombs, and they used stones and sticks and kieries.  People were killed, it doesn't matter what the method was.\n\tI don't think the Act requires of me to have or to prove that I followed a certain method before it can be said to have had a political objective.  I was there to suppress and neutralise that which Mr Biko's organisation was responsible for propagating in the country at that stage.",
