While standing and speaking with Doctor Johan Stoffberg at one end of the bar, she saw two Black men enter at the front door. All that she can recall with regard to them is that one was shorter than the other.  She could not see whether they were carrying anything in their hands. Immediately afterwards she heard sound similar to firecrackers and then there was chaos in the tavern\".\nInsofar as that refers to the attack, what is your comment - that two persons, Black persons entered the tavern, one shorter than the other immediately before the shooting?",
