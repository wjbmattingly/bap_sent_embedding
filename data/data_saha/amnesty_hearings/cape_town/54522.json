            "Now would you please read it into the record?\nCHAIRPERSON\nOesman Alexander, a Coloured man, 24 years old, living in Kewtown 633271.  I'm a student at the UWC.  On the 31st of August 1989 I had to attend a meeting of the Kewtown in Athlone.  I was late.  I arrived at the centre at approximately 10 past 8.  The meeting was finished and the people were already leaving the building when I arrived there.  At that stage there were also members of the Cape Youth Congress Members, in the front of the building.  I'm also a member of this organisation.  We were also planning to have a meeting that evening at approximately 25 minutes past eight that same evening.\n\t\tMyself and other members of the Cape Youth Congress Members, gathered in one of the halls.  This is not the same hall in which the Kewtown Youth Movement had their meeting.  We remained in this hall because the other hall was going to be used by the soccer union.  \n\t\tOn my arrival there were already members of the Soccer Unions who were having discussions in the foyer of the building.  Myself, Peter Williams, Miranda Abrahams, Senasla Meira, Gina Isaacs, Mohamed, Fatima Omar and three white men I do not know as well as another man whose name I cannot or did not know, there was also another person, but I cannot recall who that was.  \n\t\tOn the 31st of August 1989 at approximately 25 minutes before nine, while we were still having the meeting, I heard a very loud explosion.  The explosion was in the Early Learning Centre building.  I was thrown to the ground by the blow of the explosions.  Apart from the shock, I did not have any other injuries.  I did not go and visit the doctor afterwards.  I know that Fatima Omar had injuries to her face because of the glass shards.  I do not know if any others had injuries.  A lot of us were suffering from shock. \n\t\tShortly afterwards the Cape Youth Congress left.  Some of the members of the Soccer Union were also injured.  They were in the foyer when the explosion took place.  The explosion took place in the hall right next to the foyer.  This is the hall that was used by the Kewtown Youth Movement.  This is also the hall where the Soccer Union was supposed to meet.  The meeting of the Kewtown Youth Movement was very early because not a lot of people attended this meeting and if more members did arrive, this meeting would have taken a bit longer and the bomb would have exploded in their midst.\n\t\tMy vehicle, an Isuzu bakkie, was parked in front of the building (on the pavement).  The vehicle was used by myself, but it was not my property.  I know Gakkie Hardien, he was aware that I made use of this Isuzu.  If he was close to the building before or after the explosion, he would have realised that I was inside the building.  \n\t\tThree weeks later myself and Glen Joseph and Bruce Malgas met Gakkie Hardien at a party.  He told us that he missed us but that we should watch his next move.  We understood by that that he referred to the bomb explosion.  The Kewtown Youth Movement members also belonged to the Cape Congress.  \n\t\tI understand the contents of this statement and I've got no objection in taking the oath.  I see this oath as binding.  \n\t\tAthlone and the date.",
