<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a>CHAIRPERSON</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a>Oesman Alexander, a Coloured man, 24 years old, living in Kewtown 633271.  I'm a student at the UWC.  On the 31st of August 1989 I had to attend a meeting of the Kewtown in Athlone.  I was late.  I arrived at the centre at approximately 10 past 8.  The meeting was finished and the people were already leaving the building when I arrived there.  At that stage there were also members of the Cape Youth Congress Members, in the front of the building.  I'm also a member of this organisation.  We were also planning to have a meeting that evening at approximately 25 minutes past eight that same evening.</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a>		Myself and other members of the Cape Youth Congress Members, gathered in one of the halls.  This is not the same hall in which the Kewtown Youth Movement had their meeting.  We remained in this hall because the other hall was going to be used by the soccer union.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a>		On my arrival there were already members of the Soccer Unions who were having discussions in the foyer of the building.  Myself, Peter Williams, Miranda Abrahams, Senasla Meira, Gina Isaacs, Mohamed, Fatima Omar and three white men I do not know as well as another man whose name I cannot or did not know, there was also another person, but I cannot recall who that was.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a>		On the 31st of August 1989 at approximately 25 minutes before nine, while we were still having the meeting, I heard a very loud explosion.  The explosion was in the Early Learning Centre building.  I was thrown to the ground by the blow of the explosions.  Apart from the shock, I did not have any other injuries.  I did not go and visit the doctor afterwards.  I know that Fatima Omar had injuries to her face because of the glass shards.  I do not know if any others had injuries.  A lot of us were suffering from shock. </p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a>		Shortly afterwards the Cape Youth Congress left.  Some of the members of the Soccer Union were also injured.  They were in the foyer when the explosion took place.  The explosion took place in the hall right next to the foyer.  This is the hall that was used by the Kewtown Youth Movement.  This is also the hall where the Soccer Union was supposed to meet.  The meeting of the Kewtown Youth Movement was very early because not a lot of people attended this meeting and if more members did arrive, this meeting would have taken a bit longer and the bomb would have exploded in their midst.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a>		My vehicle, an Isuzu bakkie, was parked in front of the building (on the pavement).  The vehicle was used by myself, but it was not my property.  I know Gakkie Hardien, he was aware that I made use of this Isuzu.  If he was close to the building before or after the explosion, he would have realised that I was inside the building.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a>		Three weeks later myself and Glen Joseph and Bruce Malgas met Gakkie Hardien at a party.  He told us that he missed us but that we should watch his next move.  We understood by that that he referred to the bomb explosion.  The Kewtown Youth Movement members also belonged to the Cape Congress.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a>		I understand the contents of this statement and I've got no objection in taking the oath.  I see this oath as binding.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a>		Athlone and the date.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> ...(indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just for the record, if you could just put the date of the statement because October ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> It was October 1990, the 30th.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Now, you have managed to obtain at this stage only two copies, but there will be other copies coming in the very near future, the colour aerial photograph of the centre and its immediate vicinity, which may assist the Committee and all of us here in understanding the situation, or at least place it on record what the situation is.  You were at the inspection in loco, were you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That's correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes, we'll make some reference to that.  Now I'll just pass this around to my learned friends so they can have a look at it and assure them that I will give them a copy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry Mr Bizos, will it be Exhibit P?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> I'm informed that it will be N.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   The photographs are in fact N.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a>MR BIZOS:   P.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, P.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> ...(indistinct - mike not on)</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, that's right.  Thank you Mr Martini.  So it will be Exhibit P.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Now you marked spots and marked them by capital letters of the alphabet.  May I hand in the one copy so that you may follow and as soon as my learned friends have had a look at it, then ...  Now will you place on record please, from A on, what the marked spots represent?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> The capital Z is the hall that exploded where the bomb was detonated, B is known as the Raadsaal in my statement, which was the Boardroom.  C is the place where I parked my vehicle, the Isuzu bakkie, ...(indistinct) area.  D1 and D2 are spots where the Cayco Athlone Executive or Regional Members were parking and E is the parking at the back, where another member of CAYCO stayed overnight.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just before we proceed, Mr Bizos, Lower Klipfontein Road, would that be off the photograph at the bottom, if you go beyond D1 to D2, carry on down that road, you'll get that other road, I think it was called Lower Klipfontein, where you - if you're at the corner, you can see the hall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So that would be just off the photograph below D2.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> But in this particular copy it's ...(indistinct - speaking simultaneously)</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It's on ...(indistinct - speaking simultaneously) where D1 and D2 are?</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That's correct.  Further up Springbok you'll get to Lower Klipdrift Road.  Your Worship, on this particular copy of it you can see Lower Klipdrift Road clearly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> When you arrived at A10, would you please tell us how many people do you say there were in the building upon your arrival and how - well first of all, give us an overall number or tell us the various classes of people that were there and we can add them up.  You can please yourself how you want to deal with it, but we just want to get an impression of how many people there were in the building as soon as you arrived.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> In the building and its immediate surroundings, as I parked my car on the side, just immediately outside the front of the building, the Springbok Street side of the building, there were CAYCO members, about eight of them, in the foyer there were three guys of the Soccer Union, the members of the Kewtown Youth, approximately ten of them were still around in the building as well as the Security Guard, Jack, who was also in the building at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> So you say that there were almost 25 people in the building.  Now, you went into the room which has been referred to as the "Saal" or as the ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> "Raadsaal".</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> No, that's where you finished, the Board room, but where was the meeting of the Kewtown Youth ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> The Kewtown Youth Movement's meeting was in the hall where the bomb exploded.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Where the bomb exploded.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Inside that hall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Did you participate in a meeting in the hall or was the meeting transferred to the Board Room?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> The Kewtown Youth Meeting was basically winding up.  Some of the people were starting to dismiss themselves and leave and I started chatting to the Regional, the CAYCO members which had come for the Regional Meeting and I was in the foyer at the time and towards about, just before 25 past 8 we moved to the Board Room where our meeting started.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Now will you say about the foyer, what point is that on the...?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> The foyer is in between points A and B, I haven't marked it on here, but it's basically adjacent to A.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Adjacent to A.  That's the sort of entrance hall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, Mr Bizos, could I just ask a question?  I gather that many of the members of the Kewtown Youth, were also members of the Cape Youth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And the Kewtown had a meeting and then the Cape Youth were going to have a meeting.  Now did all the people who attended the Kewtown meeting go across to the Board Room to go to the Cape meeting, or did some of those members leave the hall to go home or wherever else they were going?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> You Worship, those members, except for Peter Williams, the other members left the hall and they exited at the Springbok side of the hall, or the front entrance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> The front entrance.  Only Peter Williams and you of the Kewtown Youth Committee were left behind?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is correct, Your Worship.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.  And you were in the foyer and you told us that there were some Soccer people there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Now why didn't the Youth Movement's meeting continue meeting in the hall where the explosion took place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Firstly I was late, I was one of the Executive members of the Kewtown Youth Movement, I was late and when I came there, we normally had between 35 and 50 members attending meetings.  The meeting wasn't well attended in my opinion and I assume that it was stopped because of the other meeting which would start and myself and Peter being taken out of that meeting to attend the other.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think what Mr Bizos was asking you, why didn't the Cape Youth meet in the same hall where the Kewtown Youth had concluded their meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> The Kewtown Youth movement was an affiliate of the Cape Youth Congress, but this was the Regional structure and only youth representatives would attend the Regional meeting, not everyone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> No, you haven't understood the thrust of the question.  Why did they change venues for the meeting, that's really the thrust of the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> At the time I think Beulah, Mrs Fredericks, the co-ordinator or the principal of the centre itself, had requested that we move to the Board Room because the Union, the Soccer Union was going to meet in front and move into the hall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Was it expected that the Soccer people would be more than the Executive Committee Members of the Youth Congress?</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Well it would have been the Soccer Union's meeting, not a soccer club per se, so it would have been a broader forum.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> More or less people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> It would have been at least more than what we were.  I think the CAYCO meeting was about 11 or 12 people, is it could have been a bit more.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> You were to have your meeting in the Board Room?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> You told us that those members of the Q Committee who were not to attend the Youth meeting, left and went away through the front entrance.  What is the name of the street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Springbok Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Springbok Street.  Anybody parked anywhere near where we were shown at the inspection in loco, Mr van Zyl, Mr Botha, Gakkie, had parked, would they have been able to see who was leaving at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> If they were parked at the back, they could not have seen who was leaving.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> How sure are you that the people there on the Kewtown Committee left through the front entrance?</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I was in the foyer at the time.  I saw them exiting as well as, in the event that someone was to leave by car, none of the members that evening except myself had a car, so they could not have exited the building at the back by means of a vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But if you lived in a flat on the that main road at the back, then wouldn't it be more convenient to walk through the back and car park to get to that flat, we saw big blocks of flats there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That's correct.  Your Worship what happened is because we had a lot of younger members attending, they walked in groups and a senior member or an elder person within the group, would make sure that the younger members get safely to their houses and in the past either I would drive them by means of the bakkie, or we would walk together in a group to ensure their safety.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now are you saying that none went through the back?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> None went through the back, Your Worship.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And is it not possible that they might have walked round the building and gone that way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Around the building in terms of going via the, as Mr ...(indistinct) explained, via the Josephs Town?</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Either that way, or as I recall the building, there's a fence all the way round that building.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> ;   And if you round the outside of the building, you can walk all the way round the property.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is, to an extent, that is correct, but there was - between - as you enter the Springbok Street entrance, there's a gate.  Now adjacent to the building's hall, there is another gate to allow you to walk around.  That gate was always locked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry Mr Alexander, if you take a look at Exhibit P, the photo, where is this, sorry what did you call it, Jacob's Close?</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Jacobs Close.  Josephs Town.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Josephs Town.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Josephs Town is the - there's a building with a blue roof, that is Kriek and the building to the west of ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Perhaps if you can mark it with an F.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> On that photo.  Yes I don't know if the other members want to see it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> After these people had left, if the Committee remonstrates with me, I remonstrate with my learned friends.  After the people had left, how many people were there still in the building at the time of the explosion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> At least 16.  It would be the three members of the Soccer Union I saw in front, in reception, the Security Guard as well as the Cape Youth - the CAYCO members, 12 of us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> The Security Guard's room, where is that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Basically behind, it's close to the - where the young kids are.  It's between the kitchen and the Red Unit, at the back thereof.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> I don't know whether you want that pin-pointed as well Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think I can recall it from the inspection in loco.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Perhaps I should make use of the photo slides, yes.  Could you see on any of the photographs where - have a look at photograph number 5, what does that represent?</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> The door jam, or the doors which are blown off, that's the entrance to the hall, the two sets of doors next to that would lead to Springbok side, that's the front entrance.  Where these chairs are, that's the point here that I'm referring to.  The door closest to, or to the right-hand side of the hall, of the broken doors, that's the entrance towards the parking lot or one of the entrances.  You would also walk through the kitchen, there's the very first door, the very first opening on the right-hand side, that's the entrance to the kitchen.  Now you would go via there, or via the Red Unit to the room of the Security Guard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> I see.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Or the caretakers ...(indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.  You say that there were at least, approximately, well you say precisely 16 people at the time the explosion went off.  Could you find the Board Room on the photographs please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Let me just check if I can find it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Have a look at photograph 8.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> No, it is the hall, the inside of the hall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> The inside of the hall.  If you could find the Board Room.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> 29, definitely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.  Now was there a door separating the Board Room from the passage at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> There was no door in terms of a fixed structure which separated the Board Room from the passage at the time.  If I could just add, when we went to the inspection in loco, it was also said, I think to the Committee, that just after the bomb they had erected a structure to prevent entry into that period.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> A partition.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Partition, that's right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Now at the inspection in loco, we saw the Board Room represented in photograph number 29.  Glass windows, or glass panes, right across that room, were those there at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> They were there at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Those panes, as far as I can recall, were very high up, at the ceiling.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> When you and your colleagues were in the Board Room, were the lights on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> The lights were on, definitely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> At that time, those glass panes, were they clear glass, or were they painted over?</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> It was clear glass, Your Worship.</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Anyone looking at the building from any place near where at the inspection in loco Mr van Zyl and others showed where - I think Mr van Zyl, let's confine it to him, showed where they were parked.  Would they have been able to see that the lights of the Board Room were on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That's correct.  From where they were parking, or from the side, the back side of the building, they should be able to see those panes clearly and the lights.  Had they been on the other side, they wouldn't have seen them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> ;   The other side, you mean the front?</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> The front, the Springbok side, because the windows only show to the back, it doesn't show to the front side.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Would there have been - if the lights of the lobby or of the room of the Security person or of the kitchen were on, would persons situated where we were shown they were parked, have been able to see those lights?</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Possibly the kitchen lights where they were parking and/or through the Red Unit, they could see the reception, but as far as I can - I don't think they would be able to see the Reception through the kitchen walls, but they could see it via the Red Unit, that the lights are on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> What do you mean by the Red Unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> The Red Unit is the area where children from the age of 8 months to, I think, about two and a half years, were being nursed in the day, or schooled during the day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Where is that in relation to the entrance hall, or the foyer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> It's adjacent to the foyer, next to the kitchen, adjacent to the foyer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can you recall what lights were on and what lights were off when you were there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> When I entered, the light of the hall was on, the foyer's lights were on, the passage leading towards the Board Room, those lights were on, as well as the lights in the Board Room.  The Board Room has on the - if you were to walk towards the Board Room from the foyer side, on the right-hand side there are offices, there are two toilets and the offices and those doors are closed, so you don't really check those offices, but the foyer and the passage, as well as the Board Room, those lights were definitely on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Did you have meetings at the Early Learning Centre regularly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes, Your Worship.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Is that for the Q Youth Movement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Kewtown Youth Movement.  Now let's confine ourselves to those meetings.  Did you have them regularly on the same day of the week, or did you adjourn to different days of the week?</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> We basically met on a Thursday evening, every week.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Every week.  And did you change the time of meeting and the time of the duration of the meeting, or were they fairly standard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> The meeting was fairly standard, it started at 7 up until about 9 o'clock.  If we had events like games evenings etc., it might go beyond 9 o'clock, because we had a good relationship with Jack, the caretaker of the building and with the principal, so we had flexibility in terms of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> But generally speaking, your meeting started at 7 and finished at 9?</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is correct, Your Worship.</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Were the facts that you met there, at what time you met and for how long your meetings lasted, matters of kept a secret, or did the community at large know that these meetings were taking place at that time and lasted approximately for that period of time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Basically the entire community knew when we were meeting, at what time and we never had any secret meetings there, or anywhere else for that matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> At your meetings, was it confined to members, or could you have visitors as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Our meetings were open to everyone.  Anyone could come in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Whether a member of not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Whether they're a member or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> It has been suggested that the information that reached Mr Verster, the Director of this Civil Co-operation, ...(indistinct), that the information that reached him that you were a bunch of gangsters ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That's an untruth, Your Worship.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Were you in court when you and others were asked to identify yourselves?</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is correct, Your Worship.</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> There were mainly the members of the Q Youth Movement Committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> It was mainly members of the Q Town Youth Movement as well as other CAYCO members who were in the building at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Which were in the building at the time.  Did you identify yourself at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> The other people that identified themselves, did you know them well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Did they identify themselves correctly in relation to their activities in 89 and their subsequent educational and social achievements?</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes they did, Your Worship.</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.  Where would this information - did you do anything to give any idea to anyone that you were a bunch of gangsters?</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> No, Your Worship, in fact we tried to get the kids off the street, it was one of our objectives, to try and redirect their energies and efforts to become not model citizens, but to try and achieve something in life.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Was the Kewtown Youth Movement affiliated to the UDF?</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> We were affiliated to CAYCO, Cape Youth Congress, who in turn was affiliated to the UDF?</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Oh so that was. ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Indirect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Indirect affiliation.  Did you ever discuss or permit any act of violence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> No, Your Worship, never.</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What were the aims and objectives of the Kewtown Youth Movement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Objectives were social, economic and political.  Basically we wanted to take the kids off the street.  We tried to do it by means of entertainment, outings, excursions, we tried to educate them in terms of the dispensation of the day.  Essentially we tried to better them as people, to strive for a better Kewtown as well, uplifting the community as a whole.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> How many of you on the Committee were still at school at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> The majority of our members were aged between 15 and 20 and most of the members at the time were at school, except for myself, Peter, Chris was starting to exit the Committee because he became actively involved in the Trade Union at the time and there were amongst others a school teachers, who was Claude Nicholas, known as Boetie, as well as Roy.  I think Roy's surname is Isaacs, I speak under correction.  But the rest were school-going kids, high school kids.</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> How difficult would it have been for any person that wanted to do anything to you or against you for whatever reason to determine objectively what the ages and objects were, what sort of people you were, whether you were good pupils at school?  You were a student at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Whether you were good students, or whether - what your views were and what your activities were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> It wouldn't have been difficult at all.  The meetings were open, we were all known in the community and we interacted with people within the community, so anyone could have free access and entry to our meetings and our activities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> It was also suggested that, well it was said, that information came to the Director of the CCB that you were responsible for the two explosions that had taken place in the Post Office and the Magistrate's Court.  Did you or any member of the Committee or of the organisation as far as you, in the broader organisation that was responsible for those acts?</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> No Your Worship, it was not ...(indistinct) and /or the Cape Youth Congress that had been involved there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Another bit of detail that came to the Director of the CCB was that one of the deceased that placed a bomb at one or other of the two places where the bombs exploded, was the half sister of a member - a lady member of your Committee.  Was that true or false?</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is false.  I have known Peter Williams for a very long time.  In fact he was basically my neighbour.  he lived up stairs from where I lived, so I am acquainted with his family, so that's false.</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> How difficult would it have been to check that information by anyone who intended placing a bomb at the place that you were gathered?</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> It would not have been difficult, Your Worship, Gakkie was quite familiar with Peter and Peter's family as well, so he had basically easy access and he could speak to unfairly at the time as well, prior to that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.  How far did Hardien live from ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> At the time of the bomb explosion, Peter was about 100 metres away from Gakkie, but if I could just put it into context, Peter had moved from a different part of Kewtown to that point at that time, so although I say Peter was my upstairs neighbour, at the time, when he was close to Gakkie, he didn't live - he wasn't my upstairs neighbour anymore.</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.  So do I understand you correctly, that if they - they could quite easily have checked that dramatic information would Gakkie, if they took just a bit of care?</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That's correct, Your Worship.</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Let us return to the evening in question.  you've described in your statement of hearing this tremendous explosion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Incidentally, the injury to your ear, was that a temporary or a permanent?</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Well I think it's of a permanent nature, but I can still hear properly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes, it's not serious?</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Not very serious, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Now what did you do as soon as this explosion took place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> We all were flung to the ground except for one of the members who stayed seated, I think that is Sensala Meira.  I then ran towards the, if I could just use the picture, the photograph?</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes, of course.</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> In terms of this picture, B is the Board Room.  I ran, not towards the entrance, there is another double door leading towards the Blue and Yellow Units, that's where the bigger children were and we tried running out that way, but we were basically cornered in.  There was a fence with barbed wire on top, so we ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, I don't have the photo.  So you ran towards the foyer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> We didn't run towards the foyer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Oh you went the other way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> There is another set of double doors which leads to the Blue and Yellow Units and at that double door, you come outside but you're still within the premises and the entire premises were fenced in.  We then decided to go back via the Board Room towards the foyer where people of the community started running in and attempting to help us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> At that stage, were the lights still on after the explosion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I speak under correction.  The lights in the Board Room were still on, in the passage, the foyer were still on, but I don't think the hall had any lights, thereafter it was dark, everything was hanging towards the ground and we exited the front gate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> You went out of the front gate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Did you see the people that you had seen in the entrance hall or foyer of the building, the Soccer Committee people, did you see them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I can remember seeing two people.  One was a Mr Ericson, ...(indistinct) as know to us and the other was I think Wally, if my memory serves me correctly.  I didn't see anyone else in terms of the Soccer people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Did you find out where they were at the time of the explosion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> We heard that they were in the foyer at the time of the explosion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Did you see or hear about immediately afterwards, whether any people were injured by the explosion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Basically three people that I heard about were injured, it was the Soccer people.  I don't know to what extent.  Some of them were taken by ...(indistinct) vehicles in the area to hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Other than your bakkie, was there any other vehicle outside the front part of the building?</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> If my memory serves me correctly, Mr Bizos, there were at least two other vehicles in the front, which had been used by CAYCO members.  It was, in your, it was parked onto the side of the road on the pavement between the hall and Kriek.</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Is that the side where your bakkie was parked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> My bakkie was on the opposite side.</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry Mr Bizos.  Mr Alexander, you go to that hall regularly, etc., people who live in that area in Springbok Street, the residents, do they not park their vehicles on the pavement ordinarily or usually?</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> No Your Worship, where I parked there were two houses immediately next to the Church.  At the time those people didn't have a vehicle and around the corner where the CAYCO members had parked, it wasn't on the side of the houses, it was on the opposite side.</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Let's get clarity, because I'm not sure whether we are on the same wavelength.  On the side that you vehicle was, were there other vehicles?</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> If you were to come up Springbok Street towards Lower Klipfontein Road, now I was on the left.  They were as you come down Springbok Street towards the ELC, they were on the left, so we were on different sides of the road.  It was the same - it was the front entrance side, but we were parked on different sides of the road.</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> I see.</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> To put it plainly, you were on the house sides and they were on the ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That's right and they were on the ELC side, that's correct,</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> So are those the three vehicles?</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Now what about the parking ground?</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, Mr Bizos.  My recollection, although it might not be very good of the photo, was all the D were or the C and the D1 and D2 are on the same side of the road.</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> It's the same round, but it's two-way traffic firstly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, but if you take a look  - Yes, no, you're right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Thank you Your Worship.</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Now what - after the explosion, did you see whether there were still any cars on the parking ground?</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> What happened after the explosion, I was worried about the vehicles and we were worried about ourselves.  I immediately took the bakkie and I'm not sure how many people got in with me, but I then parked the bakkie in Diza Court which was, if you were to view this photograph, the circle where Mr van Zyl-them had been parking, it was just behind those shops, that is where Diza Court is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Because one of our members had lived, or lives in Diza Court and I walked back across towards the centre.  One of the CAYCO Regional Members, Nazima Mohamed, had parked her car in the back parking and it stayed overnight as well as some of the ELC's cars which they used during the day were parked there.  The ELC is the Early Learning Centre, the staff working there, because they had social workers etc going out to other resource units, educational units during the day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> These are vehicles that belonged to the ELC that are used during the day but at night are parked in that parking place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That's correct, Your Worship.</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How many are you talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> There were about three of those vehicles and Nazima's vehicle was the fourth one.  Nazima Mohamed, or the vehicle that she drove that night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Were those four cars visible to anyone sitting in a car anywhere near the place where Mr van Zyl told us that they parked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> They would have had a clear view of those cars, Your Worship, if they had been parking where they said they were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Did you notice whether any of those cars were damaged or did anyone complain about their car being damaged?</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I can't recall that those cars were damaged, or that they weren't damaged.  There were crowds gathering all around on the back side of the ELC as well as the front side and I just mixed in with the crowd.</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> When you were in the Board Room in the state that it was in then, if anyone had come in to the place where the Soccer people were seated, the entrance hall, would that person have heard you speaking in the Board Room?</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> They should have heard us speaking because we didn't whisper, we talked normally and the distances basically from the foyer to the Board Room, if I could just put it into context, it's from where I sit now to where that partition is, round about there, the passage way that separates the foyer from the Board Room.</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> About 10 to 12 metres.</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> 10 to 12 big metres, I think.  A bit longer perhaps, but ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> 15 metres?</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> More or less 15.</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Or perhaps to be fair, we should ask somebody with medium pace ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, it looks about 15 to 20 paces to me, but...</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> No, I'll accept that.  Did you speak as softly as you're speaking here, in those meetings or were they animated meetings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Well it was in the evening, it was quiet, there wasn't lots of traffic, so ja, our voices would carry, but we didn't whisper, we didn't plan anything sinister or anything to that effect, so we had no more meetings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And do photographs 8, 9 and 14 correctly show the damage in the room which the Kewtown Youth Movement - if the meeting had not adjourned early and if the Youth Movement Meeting had not changed the place of the meeting to go into the Board Room, would anyone in the hall have had any chance of living?</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Your Worship, it's my opinion that everyone in the hall would have been killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> ;   Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR BIZOS</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Martini, do you have any questions you'd like to put to Mr Alexander?</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Thank you Chairperson.  Just a few.</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MARTINI:</span> Mr Alexander, let's just start off.  The aims of the Kewtown movement you say were political economic and social, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> And the Kewtown Youth Movement was affiliated to the Youth Congress, if I understand your evidence correctly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is correct.  Cape Youth Congress.</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Thank you, Cape Youth Congress.  And that in turn was affiliated to the United Democratic Front?</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That's also correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> And the United Democratic Front, was that affiliated to the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> It was never affiliated to the ANC.  It was above-board, legitimate organisation at the time, it was ...(indistinct) organisation, civics, youths etc.</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> When I say affiliated, maybe I used the wrong word.  Did it support the policies of the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Well in broader terms, yes, it did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> I assume so.   I mean, the Kewtown Youth Movement, or the Cape Youth Congress, didn't support the Government of the day, did they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is correct, we didn't support the government of the day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Correct.  You were anti the Government of the day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> I accept that.  And would you have subscribed to whatever policies the ANC at the time, or the philosophy of the ANC at the time, would you have subscribed to their philosophies and doctrines in respect of their attitude towards the Government of the day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> To a limited extent.  We at no point told people to commit acts of violence, or sabotage, or terror.</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> I'm not putting that to you, but you would agree, you would support the overthrow of the Government of the day?  When I say you, sorry, I mean your movement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That's correct.  Overthrow is a strong word, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Well, you would rebel against the Government of the day.  You'd want to ensure that that Government would be removed from power?</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> So to put it in a different way, you weren't regarded as a friend - when I say you, sorry Mr ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I understand, it's not personal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Ja, I mean the group.  You wouldn't regard the Government of the day as your friendly neighbour, so to speak?</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Definitely not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Correct.  Now, Mr Alexander, you signed this statement on the 30th of October 1990.</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> That's approximately over a year, 13 or 14 months after the incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Could you just explain to us how it came about that you made this statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Essentially, at the time, Edward Gordon ...(indistinct) speeches after the bombing, as well as Gakkie and we knew that Slang was picked up in terms of Section 29 .</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Oh, so you knew that Slang, Peaches and Gakkie had been arrested under Section 29?</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> It was in the newspapers, it was on the SABC news at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> And did you know that they'd made statements and stuff at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That's correct and we were - you must understand, in that particular period we didn't trust the Government at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Up until, to a democratic elected government came into power.</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> I accept that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I would want nothing to do with the Government.</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> I accept that Mr Alexander.  You've already told us, you didn't regard the Government as your friendly neighbour.  so you were aware at the time that Mr van Zyl had been arrested, Gakkie Hardien had been arrested, Peaches had been arrested and I think you also said you knew that they made statements under their detentions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Were you given the statements?</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> So how did you know that they made statements?</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> It was on the news, the SABC news at the time.  It was broadly announced.  I didn't know what the content of the statements were, but we were aware that they had been picked up in terms of ELC and other deeds.</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> So then how did it come about that you made this statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> If my memory serves me correctly, we were - the Youth at the time as well as Mr Huxley, had the process and that was someone I could trust, I would not go to a police office or whenever, because we were fearful at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> I hear you but ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I didn't quite understand what you said Mr Alexander.  So you read in the papers that Gakkie, Peaches and Mr van Zyl had been picked up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And what, did somebody come to you to take a statement or what?  How did it actually happen that you made a statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> It was well-known that we were in the building.  Initially after the bomb, I think the Cayco, or the Youth approached lawyers, but we were told by Mr Huxley at the time, if I'm not mistaken.</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, who's Mr Huxley?</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Joshua Huxley, he was an attorney in Athlone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, at this writing, I see if you look at page 208, whose writing is that?  It looks the same for - you know it's in various statements here.  Is it your writing or?</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> It's not my writing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So whose writing would that be?</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I think it was one of the legal persons and/or someone from a police agency at the time, if my memory serves me correctly.  I'm not too clear, but the signatures at the bottom and on each page, are definitely mine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  Mr Martini.</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> May I proceed Chairperson?</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Sorry, you haven't answered my question.  I still don't understand.  How did it come about?  why did you make this statement?  Let me rephrase this question.  Why did you make this statement 14 months later?</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Things were coming out.  We were not certain, but thins were coming out in terms of the CCB, they became more public.  We knew that Gakkie was part of a sinister Government organisation, but we didn't know the detail and because at the time Peaches made a statement to Mr Huxley's office, I think the advocate or the lawyer was Mr Adams, hence we were approached at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> But for what purpose?</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, who approached you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> It was Mr Huxley at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Yes and who had approached him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I think somehow Mr Adams, who was a lawyer, which was one of Mr Huxley's partners, had got in a statement from Peaches in terms of his doings within the CCB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Yes, but sorry - sorry Mr Lax.</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So what was Huxley preparing at the time, that he was taking statements from everybody?</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Well I think it was just to - so that the State was implicated within these deeds of terror and I'm not sure whether he was going to take it further, but there, at the time things became clear of State involvement within, bombings within the area etc.</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So was he busy with an investigation, or was there a civil case, or was there a criminal investigation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I think it would have been for a criminal/civil case at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Martini.</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Sorry, Mr Alexander.  So a gentlemen approaches you, members of the Kewtown movement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> What was his name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Mr Huxley.</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Who was Mr Huxley?</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> He was an attorney in Athlone and we were quite familiar with him and we trusted him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Now why were you familiar with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> He was a lawyer in the Athlone area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Did you chaps utilise him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> With regard - no we didn't utilise him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> For legal services?</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> He was ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Sorry, sorry Mr Chairman, may I just put something right?  The attorney that Mr Alexander is referring to, is not Mr Huxley ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Sorry, Chairperson, this is improper.</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> This is his evidence.   ...(indistinct - speaking simultaneously)</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> because he's testifying as a witness now, you can't correct his evidence while he's under cross-examination.  Mr Martini.</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> I'll try again, Mr Chairperson, I've really been trying.  Right.  He's an attorney that you trusted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Whom the community trusted.  He was well-known in the community.  What type of law did he practice?</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> He practised criminal, civil law and he was part of the democratic movement at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Right he was part of the United Democratic movement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Well he would have aligned himself with the UDF at the time as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Was he politically active?</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I would say he was to an extent.</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Okay and did he approach you, when I say you, because you know there were various statements, not only you, did he gather all the people that were at the ELC, that centre, and said:  "Now I want to take statements from everybody".</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> We were a group that gathered, but it was him doing the organising.  However, the guy we gave the statements to was a guy from Johannesburg, I can't remember his name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> What guy from Johannesburg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I think he had a similar surname to yours, but it wasn't you, I think it wasn't Martini, I think it was Mr Martinez, I speak under correction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> But sorry, I thought, did you go make the statement to Mr Martinez, or whatever?</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> We made these statements in their presence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> So it's not this attorney then from Athlone?  I'm not understanding your evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Sorry?</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> This Martinez ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> No, we trusted this guy from Athlone.  We trusted Mr Huxley.</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Yes, but now you've said you made the statements to Mr Martinez from Johannesburg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That's correct.  He came down from Johannesburg, he was flown down, especially.</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Okay.  Sorry.  Sorry. Correct me if I'm wrong.  So you were basically assisted by this Mr Huxley attorney?</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Because just correct me if I'm understanding your evidence correctly.  Mr Martinez wanted to take statements from various people who were present at the ELC the night of the bombing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Right now who was Mr Martinez?</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I'm not sure whether he was linked to Lawyers for Human Rights.</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> And was he, did he tell you what the reason for wanting statements?</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Once again I assume it would have been for either criminal or civil cases.</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> You were never told?</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Now did he come up to - fly down to Cape Town and meet you guys to take the statements, or did Mr Huxley take them and give them to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> No, Mr Huxley didn't take them.  He was here with - Mr Huxley was the one whom we trusted and who did the organisation locally.  This guy came down, especially for the statements.</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> So it's possible the handwriting is this Mr Martinez's, that the Chairperson asked you about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Because it's not your handwriting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> No, it's not my handwriting.  I agree and I said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> No, I accept that Mr Alexander.  I'm just clarifying what the ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> So when he sat down and wrote out your statement, I'm assuming you're relating to him the story and he's writing it down?</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Was he putting to you, you know Mr Hardien has been arrested and Mr van Zyl's been arrested for this incident and Mr Peaches has been arrested, did he put such questions to you?  Did he tell you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> No, I've told you earlier that that was clear on the media but after a while Gakkie was back in the area and thereafter he left the area, so it's no, we knew that Gakkie was involved and it was Gakkie's deeds and there was State involvement, but where would we go?  I wouldn't go the ...(indistinct) police station to go and make a statement to that effect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just before you proceed, Mr Martini.  Do you know Mr Wessel Rossouw of the Brixton Murder and Robbery Squad?</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I don't recall the name, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Because he was the Commissioner of Oaths before whom you signed the statement, according to the stamp on page ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> There were a couple of guys from Jo'burg, but I don't recall his name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It said: " Moord en Roof Eenheid, Brixton, Wessel Rossouw" and all the statements seem to have been made on the same day and before the same Commissioner.</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is correct.  All of the statements were made on the same day, but there were a couple of guys from Jo'burg, but I don't remember their names.</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And so that statement, who walked away with it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> The guy to whom we gave it and there was a group of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you don't know whether it was to be used for the police in their investigation or whether it was to be used by Lawyers for Human Rights in a potential case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> No, Your Worship, I'm speculating.  I was assuming it was going to be for either civil or criminal investigation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Martini,</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Thank you Chairperson.  You say there were others guys with this certain Mr Martinez, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Were they police officers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Well, that is what we assumed, but I can't remember them.  I remember Martinez because it came back to me when I saw him on television and it rings a bell.</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Two olives, never shaken, slightly stirred.  Mr Alexander, so you just go in and you give a statement, you don't know why you're making the statement.  You see I'll tell you why, I was always under the impression this was as a result of the police investigating the bombing, that that's why you made these statements.</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> My assumption was that it was for criminal investigation or a civil case, so I assumed and accepted it would be for that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Sure, but 14 months later, here comes a chap Martinez, let's assume his name was Martinez, together with other gentlemen from Johannesburg, not even the Athlone area and they say now:  "We want statements from you" and you don't ask him:  "Why, what for?"</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Mr Martini, we trusted the lawyer from our area, hey and for a long while after that bomb, I would go to the area at night, into the area at night, because we were fearful, we didn't know what to expect, for about three or four months I wasn't really in the area. I would go into the area at night to get clothes, to get money for food, etc.</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> So you were afraid after the bomb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes, definitely.  We knew they wanted to hit us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> So isn't it correct when Mr van Zyl says that was one of the purposes, was to frighten you guys?</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> In what regard, because we were not involved in any of those acts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> No, no, Mr van Zyl says the purpose of the bomb was to frighten you chaps and you've just conceded that you were frightened after the bomb.</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That's correct.  Who wouldn't be?  If you were in a building where a bomb explodes, you're in the building, but you were supposed to be in that venue for that whole evening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> The point I'm making ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> You would be just as afraid.</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> I accept that, but the point I'm making, you were afraid afterwards.</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is correct, but it didn't stop me from being politically active.  I was still and activist.</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> I accept that Mr Alexander, but it did have the effect of frightening you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> ...(indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> When you were making this statement, were you answering to questions?  Was this Martinez, or one of these other gentlemen asking you questions and as you were answering, they were writing it out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> If my memory serves me correctly, they asked us what happened that night and in my own words, I gave it to them, which they took down verbatim.</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> So the purpose of your statement was really to give them facts of what happened that night, is that what you're telling us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That's what I told them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Is that what you're telling the Committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Well, that's what I put into the statement, what happened that night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> But, listen to my question carefully, Mr Alexander, the purpose of your statement then was just to give facts of what happened on the night of the 31st of August 1989, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Could you - I'm going to work from Bundle D, the statement you said you also worked from, correct, the typed one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That's right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Which we'll accept what Mr Bizos told us, that it correlates to your hand-written statement.  You see you say, look at paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.  Fifth paragraph, and I'm counting the one sentence earlier up as a paragraph.  Have you got it.  Sorry, page 9, sorry, sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Page 9, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Bundle D.</p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes.  Which paragraph?</p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Five.</p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> "Die vergadering van Kewtown Youth"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> You see the second sentence</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a>"If more members had arrived the meeting would have continued for longer and the bomb would have exploded in their midst."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> That's an inference you're making, because that's not what happened, it's not a fact, it's not the actual facts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I agree it's an inference, but that was my opinion at the time, but the norm was that we would meet up until 9 o'clock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Right, so you're not stating a fact there, you're making an inference, so it seems as if you were asked this question, that's why you made that statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> But then why put that in?  Why say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a>"In the even event that more members had arrived, the bomb would have gone off in their presence"?</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> From custom and practise our meetings basically stopped at nine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> You see, now go down another two paragraphs.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a>"Ek ken Gakkie Hardien.  He was aware that I used the Isuzu.  If he had been near the building before or during the explosion, he would have realised that I was inside the building."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is also a fact.  I'd been driving that bakkie for more than a year at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> You're missing my point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I understand your point, I'm just saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> You're now blaming him and you're saying, not as a fact, you're saying:  "Gakkie knows my car and if he was near the building at the time, he would have known I was in the building".  Why are you stating that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Because it's a fact.  Gakkie knew what I was driving.  In fact the entire one side of Kewtown knew what I was driving.</p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Well how did it come about that you made such a fact in this statement?  That's really what you're being asked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I just wanted to make it clear that Gakkie knew that I was in the building.</p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Yes, but were you responding to a question that someone put to you about Gakkie?  Did someone say to you for example:  "Gakkie says there were no cars there"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I can't remind myself whether ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Because really that's what Mr Martini's getting at.</p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> At the time I thought I was putting it in my own words.  I can't remind myself that someone asked me questions.  I was asked to give a statement in terms of what happened that night and I knew that Gakkie knew that I was driving that vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> That's the point, you had to give a statement of what happened, of facts, you've told us that.  That I can accept, someone ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That I drove that vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> I accept someone will want the statement of facts from you, but why do you say:  "Ek ken Gakkie"?  Did someone ask you:  "Do you know Gakkie Hardien?"</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I can't recall that someone asked me but if they had, I can't say yes they have or they have not.  I know that Gakkie knew that I was driving that vehicle and so did the entire one part of Kewtown.</p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> I accept that but in the statement that you make, why do you say in this statement - you see earlier you said you were asked to give this statement to describe the facts that happened on the night of the 31st of August 1989, the bombing.  Now you say:  "I know Gakkie Hardien".  That suggests to me someone asked you:  "Do you know Gakkie Hardien?" at the time that you're making the statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> At the time that I made the statement, it was known that Gakkie was responsible for planting that bomb and Gakkie even threatened us.  If you read further in the statement, Gakkie threatened to come and finish us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We'll get there.  Gakkie doesn't say they must come and finish you,  he says:  "Ek het gemis", that can mean anything and he says:  "Next time ek sal jou kry".  Now we've also heard the evidence that when he arrived there, there was a bit of turmoil between other members because of Gakkie's presence, people were very unhappy that he was there, but let's stick to this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Did someone ask you?  Why out of your own accord there, if you're making a statement of fact, you say:  "Ek ken Gakkie Hardien" and then go on</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a>"He was aware that I was driving the Isuzu.  If he had been near the building before or during the explosion, he would have realised that I was inside the building."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Let me once again repeat, Mr Martini.  In terms of me at the time, we knew that Gakkie planted the bomb.  Okay?  It was public knowledge within Kewtown and in line with that, I wanted, me, I wanted to make sure that I put that fact there because, in terms of me, it was important, because he knew I drove the car, or the bakkie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Okay.  Well we'll argue it.  Let's move on.  At this time Gakkie had been arrested, he'd made a Section 29 statement, did you know that Gakkie was saying he didn't intend to kill people, at the time he made this statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I can't recall that, but I knew that he was arrested or that he planted to bomb.</p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> How did you know he planted the bomb at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Well, he was seen the afternoon with a haversack.  He told - because obviously we were afraid and we wanted to inquire some more.</p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> How did you know Gakkie planted the bomb at the site?</p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> He was seen at the venue with the haversack.  He told the staff of the ELC that he was tired, he wanted to sit in the foyer and he had been walking from I think Heideveld, or Manenberg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> You forget also, according to him, he says he put a bomb in there and he warned him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I don't think Mr Williams would allow us to be blasted to pieces, that's ludicrous.</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> But you heard what Mr Hardien's reply was from Mr Williams?</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Once again Mr Hardien also conceded that Mr Williams never uses that language and will never.</p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> But just - so you say because Mr Hardien was seen sweating, walked in with the haversack, that's why he planted the bomb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, I think it was a little bit further and also because of the fact that he had been detained in terms of Section 9.</p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay. 29, at least.</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Also because he was detained under Section 29, for the bomb.</p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Where he had made certain admissions, but I don't know ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Stop there.  Where he made certain admissions.  How do you know he made those admissions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> SABC news, newspaper, but the content, all I was interested in at the time was that he planted that bomb, not his intentions were.  He was the one who took the bomb inside there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Well if you weren't interested in his intention, then why do you say:  "He would have known I would be in the building"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Because clearly, he knows what I drive, I'm familiar to him, that's why I said it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Mr Alexander, we'll argue the point.  We'll move on ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just one little question.  After the bomb and before this in their normal course of investigating the explosion, did you make a statement to the police, Athlone police or whoever it was, that were investigating the actual bombing as from the night of the 31st of August, an ordinary police statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> No, Your Worship.  What happened was on that evening there was a Casspir parked on the corners of I think Thornton and Klipfontein main road, on that field there.  We always thought that there was police involvement.  We never, until the statement, I never saw the police, they never approached me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> If they had approached you, would you have made a statement at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Most probably very fearfully and under duress, but I would have, but I was in the building, I couldn't say I wasn't in the building, but we were fearful of them at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> When people gathered at the centre after the explosion, where were you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Excuse me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> When people gathered at the centre after the explosion, where were you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Initially I took the car to Diza Court, as I've said, or the bakkie, sorry, to Diza Court.  I mingled in with the crowd and the back and in the front of the centre and thereafter within 15 or 20 minutes, I just decided to take myself and others out of the area because we were afraid.  We were of the opinion that they would say it's Kewtown Youth is responsible for this and we would be picked up in terms of Section 29 or whatever, we would be detained and it was just normal, and we basically, at the time we basically took ourselves out of the area.  I would only come into the area at night thereafter and I wouldn't park the bakkie at my mother's place or wherever it would be easily noticeable.</p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Sorry Chairperson, would this be an appropriate time for a short adjournment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, we'll take the tea adjournment now thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a><span class="speaker">OESMAN ALEXANDER:</span> (s.u.o.)</p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Martini.</p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MARTINI:</span> (cont)</p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a>	Mr Alexander, just to go back, I didn't quite understand your evidence where you were talking about, I think in reply to the Commissioner's questions, that groups were led out the hall, younger children were accompanied by an older member, I didn't quite understand that and I don't want to mislead you.  Do you recall that evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I'm saying it was the norm that we had a couple of members who were a bit older, older being in the sense of their early twenties.  The youngest members were about between 15 and 20, I said, but they would leave in groups, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> So the gist of your evidence was that the older children accompanied the younger ones home sometimes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Now on this evening, did that happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That would be correct, as I said earlier.</p>
<p class="line" id="line546"><a name="pos546"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> And how many children were there in these groups, or younger children, let me put it that way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Normally it would be between, as I've said before, our unit consists of about 35 to 50 people and about 10 would be over 20, roughly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line548"><a name="pos548"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> So that evening, were there about 10 children that were accompanied by an older child, so to speak?</p>
<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> There were in all, when I came there, in terms of the youth, the members that counted ten roughly.  Of all the members, I think Glen Josephs was around, ...(indistinct) etc.</p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> No, no, let me ask you this.  That evening were there a group of younger children that were accompanied home by an older child?</p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Right.  Now within that group - well let me put it to you this way, how many groups of younger children were there, first of all that were accompanied?</p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> It would be one group because the members that were there would be roughly ten in terms of the youth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> So was there only one group that left accompanied by an old, 1, 2, 3, 4 older members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes, there was one group that left.  I'm not sure - the older member that would have left with them that evening was Glen Josephs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Okay, so there was one group that left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Now how many members were in that group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I would assume it would be in total between 8 and 9 people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> 8, 9, 10.</p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Well, Peter was counted in with the bigger ...(indistinct - speaking simultaneously)</p>
<p class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> He stayed behind?</p>
<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> He stayed behind.</p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> But the group that left?</p>
<p class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> About 9 people, 8 or 9 people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line566"><a name="pos566"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Including the older person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line568"><a name="pos568"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Now were they all Kewtown Youth members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line570"><a name="pos570"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> And were they all the members that were there, for the Kewtown Youth Movement, other than Mr  Williams?</p>
<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> So by the time you arrived, all the Kewtown Youth members that were there, willingly, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> They were just finishing off, ready to exit, ja.</p>
<p class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Sorry?</p>
<p class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> They were finishing off, ready to exit.  Some of the people, the meeting was unwinding and as it unwinded, some people came out and they were preparing to leave, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> But there was an older one that was going to accompany the younger ones?</p>
<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> So that they group together and leave.</p>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> So did you see them leave?</p>
<p class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I was in the foyer, I saw them leave.</p>
<p class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> You see in your statement you say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a>"The meeting had adjourned and people were already leaving the building during my arrival."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> During my arrival, I was in the foyer, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line585"><a name="pos585"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> So before you even arrived, people were leaving?</p>
<p class="line" id="line586"><a name="pos586"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> No, my learned friend must be careful, you mustn't put a gloss or editorialise the answer and ask a question on the edited version.</p>
<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Chairperson,</p>

<p class="line" id="line589"><a name="pos589"></a>I read that to mean that while you were arriving the meeting had ended, people were already leaving.</p>
<p class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> People were exiting the hall, they were unwinding.  I was in the reception area.  You will see that I said I came there ten past eight.  The Cayco meeting only started at twenty five past eight.</p>
<p class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Tell me what this means, go to page 8 of your statement.</p>

<p class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a>	What does that mean?</p>
<p class="line" id="line596"><a name="pos596"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> To put it into context for you sir, every night when we leave here, or ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line597"><a name="pos597"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> No, what I ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line598"><a name="pos598"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I want to put it into context for you sir.   When the Commission leaves the hall, does everybody immediately leave the hall when everything is stopped?</p>
<p class="line" id="line599"><a name="pos599"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Mr Alexander ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line600"><a name="pos600"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is what happened there, people were unwinding.</p>
<p class="line" id="line601"><a name="pos601"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Mr Bizos objected, and I want you to tell me what that means.  Does that mean, correct me if I am wrong, I am going to try and help you.  To me that means as you were arriving, people were leaving, is that correct, my interpretation, or is that wrong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line602"><a name="pos602"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> It is not fully correct.  The meeting, the formal meeting of the Kewtown Youth Movement was done and people were starting to come outside of the hall, unwinding, and they would talk before they leave.  It is not, you get done and you walk out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line603"><a name="pos603"></a>MR MARTINI</p>

<p class="line" id="line606"><a name="pos606"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is how I stated it, but that was in fact my meaning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line607"><a name="pos607"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> So your meaning then is that they hadn't left, they were standing around, talking?</p>
<p class="line" id="line608"><a name="pos608"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line609"><a name="pos609"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> So they didn't leave the "gebou"?</p>

<p class="line" id="line641"><a name="pos641"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Yes, but you said that your meetings were open to everybody, to the public, that anyone could arrive?</p>
<p class="line" id="line642"><a name="pos642"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes, but obviously if people arrived, we would let the person introduce himself to the bigger forum.</p>
<p class="line" id="line643"><a name="pos643"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> But hang on, just can I stop you.  The Cape Youth, there has been no discussion about whether those meetings were closed or open, Kewtown Youth were open, that is what he said so far?  Talking about Cayco, that is a different matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line644"><a name="pos644"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Let me ask you, the Cape Youth Congress meetings, were they open to the public?</p>
<p class="line" id="line645"><a name="pos645"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Those meetings were only affiliated branches, not open to the public.</p>
<p class="line" id="line646"><a name="pos646"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> So in other words if there was a Cape Youth Congress meeting going on, only members were allowed to attend, it wasn't open to any member of the public to come in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line647"><a name="pos647"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line648"><a name="pos648"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Right.  But your evidence is the Kewtown Youth Movement's meetings were open to the public?</p>
<p class="line" id="line649"><a name="pos649"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line650"><a name="pos650"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Now, is it also correct that various members of the Kewtown Youth Movement were members of the Cape Youth Congress?</p>
<p class="line" id="line651"><a name="pos651"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line652"><a name="pos652"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Were you a member?</p>
<p class="line" id="line653"><a name="pos653"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line654"><a name="pos654"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Of both, when I say both, Kewtown and Youth Congress?</p>
<p class="line" id="line655"><a name="pos655"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is correct.</p>

<p class="line" id="line666"><a name="pos666"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Let me help you this way, I am going to read out these names, tell me if these names belong to both movements, in other words Cape Youth Congress or Kewtown.  Yourself, a member of both?</p>

<p class="line" id="line679"><a name="pos679"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Cayco.</p>
<p class="line" id="line680"><a name="pos680"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Now, did you all know each other?</p>
<p class="line" id="line681"><a name="pos681"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes, we knew one another.</p>
<p class="line" id="line682"><a name="pos682"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Did you know the members by name?  Sorry, in the Cape Youth Congress, in the Cape Youth Congress, did you know each other?</p>
<p class="line" id="line683"><a name="pos683"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Well, broadly because we saw them much more frequently, so I would know their names.</p>
<p class="line" id="line684"><a name="pos684"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> No, no, the members of the Cape Youth Congress, did you all know each other?</p>
<p class="line" id="line685"><a name="pos685"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> The Cape Youth Congress was a vast organisation sir, it had numerous Youth Branches, it was Youth structures throughout the Cape.</p>
<p class="line" id="line686"><a name="pos686"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> How would you know if someone arrived to a meeting there, whether he was a member?</p>
<p class="line" id="line687"><a name="pos687"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> It was regionalised.   (Indistinct) consisted of x amount of branches.</p>
<p class="line" id="line688"><a name="pos688"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Right, but at your meeting at ELC, would you know all the members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line689"><a name="pos689"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> We would be familiar with faces or names.</p>
<p class="line" id="line690"><a name="pos690"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Let me finish.  Would you know all your members when they arrived at that meeting?  Would you know who they are?</p>
<p class="line" id="line691"><a name="pos691"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Mr Chairman, it may be that these matters are completely foreign to Mr Martini, I think the evidence is clear that the Youth Congress meeting consisted of representatives of Youth organisations, it was not the members of the organisation as a whole that attended it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line692"><a name="pos692"></a>	I don't know if Mr Martini wants further explanation, I think the witness will deal with it, but he must not assume with respect, that any member of any Youth organisation could come to an Executive meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line693"><a name="pos693"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> No Chairperson, I don't assume that, I am asking the witness to make me understand.  Now please tell me, the Cape Youth Congress, the members, I understand it might be regionalised, now this Cape Youth Congress, this regional congress of which you were a member, they met at the ELC, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line694"><a name="pos694"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line695"><a name="pos695"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Right.  Would you know the members of that regional congress by name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line696"><a name="pos696"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I would know most of them by name and those which I don't know, someone else in that meeting, present, would know.  We all came from various branches within the region.</p>
<p class="line" id="line697"><a name="pos697"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> All right, so when someone arrives at the meeting, there was no identification process, was there, to get into the meeting or not?  You just walked in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line698"><a name="pos698"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> It wasn't a secret organisation sir, we don't do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line699"><a name="pos699"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> That is my point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line700"><a name="pos700"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> But we knew our members, not by name or by face etc, because we ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line701"><a name="pos701"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Mr Alexander, just get a bit closer to the microphone.  As you go further away, it gets softer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line702"><a name="pos702"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Sorry, I want to see his face, sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line703"><a name="pos703"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just before you proceed, was this an Executive Meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line704"><a name="pos704"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> It was a regional meeting, it was representatives of the various Youths within the region.  Cayco was broken into regions, we had the Athlone region which consisted of eight or ten branches of respective Youth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line705"><a name="pos705"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think what I am trying to get at, was it restricted to people who were in managerial or executive positions within their branches, or theoretically could a couple of hundred people pitch up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line706"><a name="pos706"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> It was never a couple of hundred people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line707"><a name="pos707"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, but I mean theoretically?</p>
<p class="line" id="line708"><a name="pos708"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line709"><a name="pos709"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So it was just people from Executive Committees of their branches who attended this sort of Regional meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line710"><a name="pos710"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line711"><a name="pos711"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line712"><a name="pos712"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> You say it wasn't secretive, so why didn't you open to the members of the community, as you did with the Kewtown Youth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line713"><a name="pos713"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> This was a different forum, Kewtown Youth was a particular forum, this was the parent forum in terms of Kewtown Youth, if I can draw the analogy as such.</p>
<p class="line" id="line714"><a name="pos714"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> But it wasn't secretive?</p>
<p class="line" id="line715"><a name="pos715"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> It wasn't secretive.</p>
<p class="line" id="line716"><a name="pos716"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> So was there any reason to exclude members of the community from attending those meetings as they were allowed to do with Kewtown?</p>
<p class="line" id="line717"><a name="pos717"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> There was no reason, but we basically dealt at a different level, it was the Executive or members of those branches which were elected to go there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line718"><a name="pos718"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> I want to get to one more point, you heard, were you here when Mr Peter Williams were putting certain versions on the record to Mr van Zyl and even during the arguments over the venue?  Did you recall him saying that, that was more in argument, that this bomb divided the community.  Would that be correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line719"><a name="pos719"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes, to an extent.</p>
<p class="line" id="line720"><a name="pos720"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> How did it divide the community?</p>
<p class="line" id="line721"><a name="pos721"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Because there was mistrust for a long time within the community.  The community mainly consisted of working class people, it was a sub-economic community, and you had your gang groupings within that community, which would side with the likes of, or certain of those guys, would certainly side with the likes of Isgak, because of his connection to them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line722"><a name="pos722"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> When you say mistrust, what would that mean, what do you mean, why didn't they trust, for example another group not trust the Kewtown group, the Kewtown Youth Movement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line723"><a name="pos723"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Not in that particular way, but we were fearful, we didn't know what to expect, we didn't know who else was coopted by the CCB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line724"><a name="pos724"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Were you, were there rumours at the time that this was your own bomb that went off and that what are you guys getting up to, within the community?</p>
<p class="line" id="line725"><a name="pos725"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Never within the community?</p>
<p class="line" id="line726"><a name="pos726"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Never?</p>
<p class="line" id="line727"><a name="pos727"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> There was disinformation in terms of the State and that is what we feel, the people in the community knew and stood by the members of the Kewtown Youth, all along.</p>
<p class="line" id="line728"><a name="pos728"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> So you say there was disinformation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line729"><a name="pos729"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> In terms of the State.  We thought that the State wanted to pick us up in terms of it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line730"><a name="pos730"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry Mr Alexander, you say there was disinformation on the part of the State, was there actually any newspaper reports or in the media, what ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line731"><a name="pos731"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> No, it was spread by means of ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line732"><a name="pos732"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you afraid that there would be disinformation, I just want to find out whether there was actually disinformation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line733"><a name="pos733"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Sorry, let me correct myself, I was afraid that there would be, but Gakkie was also spreading rumours.  Gakkie was sowing seeds to that effect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line734"><a name="pos734"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Do I understand you then correctly, if he spread the rumours, there were rumours within the community?</p>
<p class="line" id="line735"><a name="pos735"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Well, not to the people that mattered.  Amongst his friends, but in essence the mothers, the Residents' Association, etc, supported the Kewtown Youth.  That is why I could go there at night, that is why I wasn't fearful in terms of walking there at night.  In terms of the day, I felt that the police could pick me up and label me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line736"><a name="pos736"></a>	That is the way we thought at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line737"><a name="pos737"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Did you think that the police would have thought that it was your bomb, that you were involved in radical activities?  Not yours, when I say you ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line738"><a name="pos738"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I know what you are saying sir.  We knew how the State operated, and we were fearful.</p>
<p class="line" id="line739"><a name="pos739"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> You haven't answered my question.  Was that one of your fears?</p>
<p class="line" id="line740"><a name="pos740"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That was a fear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line741"><a name="pos741"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> That the State might believe this is what, it is a limpet mine, it is one of theirs and they are radicals and arrest you guys.  Did you fear that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line742"><a name="pos742"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Well, yes and no, because we weren't radicals.</p>
<p class="line" id="line743"><a name="pos743"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Okay.  Wrong choice of words.  Did you know Rev Lionel Louw?</p>
<p class="line" id="line744"><a name="pos744"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line745"><a name="pos745"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Who was he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line746"><a name="pos746"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I didn't know him in a personal capacity, but I knew he was part of the Board of the ELC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line747"><a name="pos747"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Would it be correct if I say he was the Foundation's Vice-President?</p>
<p class="line" id="line748"><a name="pos748"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is correct.  I know he was on the top structure, I don't know in which capacity.</p>
<p class="line" id="line749"><a name="pos749"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> The Foundation, I take it that would be the Western Cape  Foundation for Community Work in Athlone?</p>
<p class="line" id="line750"><a name="pos750"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> FCW, that is right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line751"><a name="pos751"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Now, have you got Exhibit J in front of you?  It is an exhibit, a newspaper clipping that my learned colleagues handed in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line752"><a name="pos752"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Is it in Bundle J?</p>
<p class="line" id="line753"><a name="pos753"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> No, it is an exhibit, unfortunately Mr Alexander.  My one seems to have - sorry Mr Lax, it has two press clippings.  According to my notes it is marked Exhibit J, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line754"><a name="pos754"></a>	It seems to be that one, yes.  On the right it's got "bomb blast at the Western Foundation", is that the one you have, Mr Alexander?</p>
<p class="line" id="line755"><a name="pos755"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line756"><a name="pos756"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> The top bit, do you see it says "state of emergency - Cape Times - 1-09-1989", do you see that?  The top article?</p>
<p class="line" id="line757"><a name="pos757"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line758"><a name="pos758"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Can you read, I will read to you, let's read the bottom, the last paragraph</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line759"><a name="pos759"></a>"... the Rev Lionel Louw, the Foundation's Vice-President said responsibility for the blast lies with those opposed to our struggle."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line760"><a name="pos760"></a>	Is that correct, will you support that statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line761"><a name="pos761"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I would support that statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line762"><a name="pos762"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Would you agree that in this press statement he is placing blame, maybe to some of the agents of the Apartheid government at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line763"><a name="pos763"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line764"><a name="pos764"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> He goes on, he says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line765"><a name="pos765"></a>"... community organisations used the hall, and in no way do we consider that members of any community organisation would have placed the bomb."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line766"><a name="pos766"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is also correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line767"><a name="pos767"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> He is making a statement to dispel, would you agree, any suggestions that it was a bomb of one of the communities that operated from his hall, would you agree with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line768"><a name="pos768"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I would agree with that fully.</p>
<p class="line" id="line769"><a name="pos769"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Would you therefore agree that by making that statement, it is because there must have been such rumours floating around the community?</p>
<p class="line" id="line770"><a name="pos770"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Not necessarily, but ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line771"><a name="pos771"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Sorry Chairperson, the audience mustn't help him answer the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line772"><a name="pos772"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Not necessarily.  Immediately after the bomb, I had still dealings with the ELC, I still knew the people there and we would be in contact, but beyond that, to the people that matters, like the people of the ELC, the KRA at the time, Kewtown Residents' Association and the people within the broader area, we were never labelled as the bombers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line773"><a name="pos773"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Why do you think he would make such a statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line774"><a name="pos774"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> As I have said before, most probably, in my opinion, disinformation which was being spread by either the media or the State, I cannot recall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line775"><a name="pos775"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Correct, so then you would agree, there must have been such rumours floating around?</p>
<p class="line" id="line776"><a name="pos776"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> But as I have said before sir, about 90 percent of the area ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line777"><a name="pos777"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Just answer me, Mr Alexander, would you agree with that?  Would you agree with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line778"><a name="pos778"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Your microphone is off, Mr Martini.</p>
<p class="line" id="line779"><a name="pos779"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Sorry.  Would you agree with that statement, that there must have then rumours?</p>
<p class="line" id="line780"><a name="pos780"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> There might have been.</p>
<p class="line" id="line781"><a name="pos781"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Do you accept that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line782"><a name="pos782"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I would accept that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line783"><a name="pos783"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Thank you.   Now just a few more questions, Mr Alexander.</p>
<p class="line" id="line784"><a name="pos784"></a>	I accept that after the bomb, you must have been shocked and traumatised?</p>
<p class="line" id="line785"><a name="pos785"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes, I was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line786"><a name="pos786"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Just tell us briefly, after the bombing, exactly what did you do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line787"><a name="pos787"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> As we exited, or what?  Immediately as the bomb exploded?</p>
<p class="line" id="line788"><a name="pos788"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Just shortly thereafter, the bomb explode, I can accept there must have been chaos in that hall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line789"><a name="pos789"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line790"><a name="pos790"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> You must have been shocked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line791"><a name="pos791"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line792"><a name="pos792"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> I think you said you actually got flung to the ground?</p>
<p class="line" id="line793"><a name="pos793"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line794"><a name="pos794"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> What did you then do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line795"><a name="pos795"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> We, as I have explained earlier, we tried to go towards the yellow ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line796"><a name="pos796"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> No, you, Mr Alexander?</p>
<p class="line" id="line797"><a name="pos797"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Because I knew the centre, I ran towards the double doors which led towards the yellow and blue unit, we went into the, it is almost like an open area outside, but it was still within the parameter, there was a fence around.</p>
<p class="line" id="line798"><a name="pos798"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Facing the front, let's call it the front then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line799"><a name="pos799"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes, we were still within the premises, we couldn't find our way out there, and we ran towards the main entrance, the front side, which was the entrance towards Springbok Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line800"><a name="pos800"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Can I just ask you to indicate on this picture which direction you ran in?  There is Springbok Street along the one side, and there is Klapperbos Street along the other side, and then there is Abduraman Avenue on the other side, and then there is Klipfontein Road on the other side, those are the sort of four accesses if you like.</p>
<p class="line" id="line801"><a name="pos801"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line802"><a name="pos802"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Let me just put on record, I have a photograph with a much broader focus, a wider focus.</p>
<p class="line" id="line803"><a name="pos803"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It is different to the one I have, which is Exhibit D?</p>
<p class="line" id="line804"><a name="pos804"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> It shows all four streets?  The building is still substantively there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line805"><a name="pos805"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Could I draw on there, or ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line806"><a name="pos806"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Shouldn't, before we proceed, shouldn't we all have a photo or number this photo, because I see it is marked Exhibit P, but it is not the same?</p>
<p class="line" id="line807"><a name="pos807"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Perhaps we can call it P1 and P2, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line808"><a name="pos808"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The first one that was handed in, that is the close-up version, which doesn't show Lower Klipfontein Road, will be P1 and then the wider angled lens photo, will be P2.</p>
<p class="line" id="line809"><a name="pos809"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line810"><a name="pos810"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> We don't seem to have these documents, Chairperson.  I have P1.</p>
<p class="line" id="line811"><a name="pos811"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We will get them both.</p>
<p class="line" id="line812"><a name="pos812"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Be that as it may, the actual image of the building is just slightly smaller on P2 and for the purposes of this, you say you ran towards these other, you used various colours, blocks?</p>
<p class="line" id="line813"><a name="pos813"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> We cannot follow this, we don't have all these blocks and colours.</p>
<p class="line" id="line814"><a name="pos814"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> With the greatest of respect, if you listened to the question ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line815"><a name="pos815"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> The colours, we don't have ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line816"><a name="pos816"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Just listen to the question, the witness referred to certain blocks, they aren't on the picture.</p>
<p class="line" id="line817"><a name="pos817"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> The blue and yellow unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line818"><a name="pos818"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> He spoke about the blue and yellow units.</p>
<p class="line" id="line819"><a name="pos819"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> We don't have blue and yellow units?</p>
<p class="line" id="line820"><a name="pos820"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> With respect, they are not on the picture, Mr Martini, if you would just stop and listen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line821"><a name="pos821"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line822"><a name="pos822"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Martini, they said they had a red unit which was somewhere else, near the foyer, where young kids played, and then within the building, they've got an area called the blue unit and the yellow unit which is the other side of the boardroom, but it is not reflected on the map.</p>
<p class="line" id="line823"><a name="pos823"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Chairperson, we are at cross purposes, I was - earlier there were certain markings on this plan, there was A is this, D is ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line824"><a name="pos824"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, it is not that at all.  It is not that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line825"><a name="pos825"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> I saw some yellow colours then, and now ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line826"><a name="pos826"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> No, that has nothing to do with it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line827"><a name="pos827"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> (Indistinct) I will try and follow Mr Lax.</p>
<p class="line" id="line828"><a name="pos828"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> From the nature of the photographs, I realised that there were certain colour codings on door frames, and those were the blocks that you were talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line829"><a name="pos829"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line830"><a name="pos830"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Now, if one looks at this picture, both pictures are I don't know what the, in terms of the compass, which is north and which is south, but if one looks at Klapperbos is on the right, and Klipfontein is on the left of the actual exhibit as you are looking at it,  as you are looking at it in landscape view, landscape as opposed to portrait, in other words horizontally, longwise like this.  Okay, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line831"><a name="pos831"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> If I turn it landscape and with the circle at the back, closest to me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line832"><a name="pos832"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Correct.  The circle away from you.  The circle away from you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line833"><a name="pos833"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Away from me?  Okay, the other way around.  Then Klapperbos would be on the right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line834"><a name="pos834"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Correct.   Now with the picture in that orientation, which direction did you run in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line835"><a name="pos835"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> We ran towards Klapperbos side.</p>
<p class="line" id="line836"><a name="pos836"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line837"><a name="pos837"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Okay.   And then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line838"><a name="pos838"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> There is a double door there, which we opened, and if you look at the picture still in front of you, there is, next to the road there is a parameter there, there is vibracrete with a fence on top of it, so we came into an open area, but we were still within the premises.</p>
<p class="line" id="line839"><a name="pos839"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> I accept that, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line840"><a name="pos840"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> We couldn't go beyond that point, and we turned back, came back through those double doors, went towards the foyer and exited the building towards Springbok Street side, which is the front entrance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line841"><a name="pos841"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> The front entrance, right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line842"><a name="pos842"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line843"><a name="pos843"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> And then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line844"><a name="pos844"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> After we were sure that all of our members were out of the building, I immediately took my bakkie and I went to go and park it in Disa Court.</p>
<p class="line" id="line845"><a name="pos845"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Which, when we are looking at this landscape is to the right or to the ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line846"><a name="pos846"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Disa Court is, I think you attended the scene in loco?</p>
<p class="line" id="line847"><a name="pos847"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line848"><a name="pos848"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> There are shops, at the parking, at the back of the ELC, there is a group of shops, Disa Court is just behind those shops.</p>
<p class="line" id="line849"><a name="pos849"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Okay.  Now, is there any reason why you didn't run through ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line850"><a name="pos850"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Just, just, sorry, are the shops on the Lower Klipfontein side or on the Dr Abduraman Avenue side?</p>
<p class="line" id="line851"><a name="pos851"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Dr Abduraman, they are in that road, Abduraman Avenue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line852"><a name="pos852"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line853"><a name="pos853"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Now, is there any reason why you didn't run through the doors leading to the parking area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line854"><a name="pos854"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> No, we wanted to get out of the building, and as we ran out, the norm was that more than one bomb would explode, and we were fearful, we just wanted to exit the building.</p>
<p class="line" id="line855"><a name="pos855"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> But when you exited, looking at this thing, you were out, actually outside, but within the parameter of the building, it looks green on this map?  Were you not outside the first time you ran out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line856"><a name="pos856"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> The first time we ran out, we were outside, but we weren't out of the premises.</p>
<p class="line" id="line857"><a name="pos857"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line858"><a name="pos858"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Our cars were parked in front, we wanted to get away from the building.</p>
<p class="line" id="line859"><a name="pos859"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> You were out of the building, you were out in the open?</p>
<p class="line" id="line860"><a name="pos860"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes, but we were within the parameters, that is right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line861"><a name="pos861"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line862"><a name="pos862"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> There was a vibracrete fence and on top of that, there was a wire fence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line863"><a name="pos863"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> So you couldn't jump over?</p>
<p class="line" id="line864"><a name="pos864"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> You couldn't jump over.</p>
<p class="line" id="line865"><a name="pos865"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Now, coming through he foyer, the way I remember, if you had run straight, you could have run straight through the doors leading to the parking area, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line866"><a name="pos866"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> You could have.</p>
<p class="line" id="line867"><a name="pos867"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Is there any reason why you didn't do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line868"><a name="pos868"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Because my car was parked in front of the building.</p>
<p class="line" id="line869"><a name="pos869"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> You just wanted to get home?</p>
<p class="line" id="line870"><a name="pos870"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I didn't just want to get home, I wanted to get out and make sure that all of us were out and move my car away from the building, the bakkie, the vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line871"><a name="pos871"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> And you took it home?</p>
<p class="line" id="line872"><a name="pos872"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I didn't take it home.  I took it to Disa Court.</p>
<p class="line" id="line873"><a name="pos873"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Disa Court?</p>
<p class="line" id="line874"><a name="pos874"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> One of our members lived there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line875"><a name="pos875"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> All right, and then you came back?</p>
<p class="line" id="line876"><a name="pos876"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I walked across, I didn't come back with the vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line877"><a name="pos877"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Yes, you walked back, and when you walked back, by then I assume that there was a lot of activity at this place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line878"><a name="pos878"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is correct, there were people on the - apparently today there is almost like a basket ball court next to the ELC, I think you  must have seen it, there were people standing on that field there, I mixed in with the people, and I also went around, because the entire building on both sides, had people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line879"><a name="pos879"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> The back as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line880"><a name="pos880"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> At the back, there were people standing as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line881"><a name="pos881"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Did the Fire Brigade arrive, the Police arrive?  I am not saying they did as a fact, I am asking you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line882"><a name="pos882"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> There were, as Mr Hardien stated, "daar was baie ligte", meaning that there were police vehicles and I would assume fire brigade vehicles as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line883"><a name="pos883"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> That is when you walked back?</p>
<p class="line" id="line884"><a name="pos884"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> No, because within, I think within minutes, not even, literally speaking I just went across and it takes me less than a minute to run across again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line885"><a name="pos885"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Coming back?</p>
<p class="line" id="line886"><a name="pos886"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> So within minutes of the bomb, I came back, but there were police, within minutes there were police at the scene.</p>
<p class="line" id="line887"><a name="pos887"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Within minutes of the bomb exploding or with you leaving?</p>
<p class="line" id="line888"><a name="pos888"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> No, within minutes of the bomb exploding.</p>
<p class="line" id="line889"><a name="pos889"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Were they at the front, at the back?</p>
<p class="line" id="line890"><a name="pos890"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I think they were at the back entrance more, but there must have been police cars in front, but I have also testified earlier that there was a casspir sort of vehicle on the corners of Thornton and Klipfontein Road, on that field next to the Civic Centre, which was parked there all night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line891"><a name="pos891"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Did the police go and park in the parking area at the back?</p>
<p class="line" id="line892"><a name="pos892"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Not in the area no, they didn't.  They were outside, as you would remind yourself, there is a fence around the parking area with a big gate.  That gate was always there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line893"><a name="pos893"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Was the gate locked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line894"><a name="pos894"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Well, I do not, I don't think so because police had to get access into the building, it wasn't locked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line895"><a name="pos895"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Well, that is why I asked you did the police park in the parking area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line896"><a name="pos896"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> They didn't park in the parking lot, they parked outside where we parked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line897"><a name="pos897"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> How many police cars were there?  Sorry, when you say "outside where we parked", outside in the front or in the parking area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line898"><a name="pos898"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> No, no, where we parked when we went for the inspection in loco.</p>
<p class="line" id="line899"><a name="pos899"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> In the parking area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line900"><a name="pos900"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> No, all of us didn't park in the parking area, people were parking outside the parking area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line901"><a name="pos901"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Okay.  So there is that extra piece there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line902"><a name="pos902"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> There is a big piece there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line903"><a name="pos903"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Were there a lot of cars parked around there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line904"><a name="pos904"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Not a lot of cars, but it was basically police vehicles.</p>
<p class="line" id="line905"><a name="pos905"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> How many would you say were there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line906"><a name="pos906"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I cannot give you a definite answer in terms of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line907"><a name="pos907"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> If you can't, you can't.  I am just asking.</p>
<p class="line" id="line908"><a name="pos908"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> There were a number of vehicles parked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line909"><a name="pos909"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> And there was a lot of activity, I take it, people mingling around?</p>
<p class="line" id="line910"><a name="pos910"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I was mingling with this people as well.  I could fit in, I was from the area.  I could walk amongst whoever.</p>
<p class="line" id="line911"><a name="pos911"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Yes, but there were a lot of people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line912"><a name="pos912"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line913"><a name="pos913"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> In the parking lot, were there a lot of people when you arrived back after you had left your car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line914"><a name="pos914"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Not in the parking lot, because people were moved away from the building by the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line915"><a name="pos915"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> So there was no access into the parking lot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line916"><a name="pos916"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Not really.</p>
<p class="line" id="line917"><a name="pos917"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> What was your state of mind at the time, were you shocked, concerned, traumatised?</p>
<p class="line" id="line918"><a name="pos918"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I was shocked, concerned, but I was right, all my faculties on top.</p>
<p class="line" id="line919"><a name="pos919"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> But you were discussing, talking to people, I assume, what went on here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line920"><a name="pos920"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Mixing and mingling with the people, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line921"><a name="pos921"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> What made you stop to see if there were cars in the parking lot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line922"><a name="pos922"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Because we knew that one of the members, Nazeema Mohammed's car was still there, in the parking lot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line923"><a name="pos923"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> How did you know that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line924"><a name="pos924"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> She was with me in the meeting, and I went to go and park my bakkie there and there were pamphlets in that car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line925"><a name="pos925"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Now you see you also said that there were cars that belonged to the ELC, correct me if I am mistaken?</p>
<p class="line" id="line926"><a name="pos926"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line927"><a name="pos927"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Were used by the ELC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line928"><a name="pos928"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line929"><a name="pos929"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> You see Mr Williams put versions to Mr van Zyl and at no stage did he ever put that there were cars that were used by the ELC, stationary in that parking lot?  Can you explain why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line930"><a name="pos930"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> He might have omitted to see that, but in my opinion, I knew from (indistinct), and I went to go and check.  I cannot speak for Mr Williams, but from my experience and memory, there were cars in the parking lot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line931"><a name="pos931"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Will you say it was an oversight on Mr Williams' part?</p>
<p class="line" id="line932"><a name="pos932"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I would assume that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line933"><a name="pos933"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> These ELC vehicles, what were they, kombi type vehicles to transport kids?</p>
<p class="line" id="line934"><a name="pos934"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> No, sedan vehicles.</p>
<p class="line" id="line935"><a name="pos935"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Or were they sedans, what sort of vehicles?</p>
<p class="line" id="line936"><a name="pos936"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> It was sedan type of vehicles, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line937"><a name="pos937"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> One last question, Mr Alexander ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line938"><a name="pos938"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Your microphone, Mr Martini.</p>
<p class="line" id="line939"><a name="pos939"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Oh, sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line940"><a name="pos940"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You've got no junior to help you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line941"><a name="pos941"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> It keeps going off.  One final question, Mr Alexander, were you in court when Mr van Zyl testified?</p>
<p class="line" id="line942"><a name="pos942"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> In court or ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line943"><a name="pos943"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> In the hearing, sorry?</p>
<p class="line" id="line944"><a name="pos944"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes, I was here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line945"><a name="pos945"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Did you hear him apologise to the victims?</p>
<p class="line" id="line946"><a name="pos946"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes, and no.  I heard him apologise, but did he mean it?  He was still not being truthful about what happened, so ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line947"><a name="pos947"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> That is your opinion, but I am just asking a simple question, did you hear him apologise?</p>
<p class="line" id="line948"><a name="pos948"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line949"><a name="pos949"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Now, do you accept his apology?</p>
<p class="line" id="line950"><a name="pos950"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> No, I don't.  He was not truthful.  I came here with the sole reason to get the truth, and if that was, had been spoken, I would have given my hand in friendship and or, which I did to Mr Ferdi Barnard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line951"><a name="pos951"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Yes, we will get to that, but you don't accept his apology?</p>
<p class="line" id="line952"><a name="pos952"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> No.  He wasn't truthful.</p>
<p class="line" id="line953"><a name="pos953"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> You are not prepared to reconcile with Mr van Zyl?</p>
<p class="line" id="line954"><a name="pos954"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> If he is prepared to come and testify and speak the truth, at any other point ...</p>

<p class="line" id="line956"><a name="pos956"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> No, I am not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line957"><a name="pos957"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> I am going to finish off with you now, you are not prepared to reconcile with Mr van Zyl?</p>
<p class="line" id="line958"><a name="pos958"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> No, I am not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line959"><a name="pos959"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> And I take it you have been discussing it with other members and victims that all sat here, that that is also their opinion or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line960"><a name="pos960"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Well, I cannot speak and decide for them, but from my experience, I know that he was not being truthful.</p>
<p class="line" id="line961"><a name="pos961"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> I ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line962"><a name="pos962"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I was in the building, I cannot speak for them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line963"><a name="pos963"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> I am not asking you whether he is being truthful or not, that the Commission will make a decision on.  I am asking you when you say you are not prepared to reconcile with him, can I, I am not being unfair to you, having, I saw you mingle with the other victims.</p>
<p class="line" id="line964"><a name="pos964"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes, I mingle with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line965"><a name="pos965"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> You had discussions, do they hold the same view?</p>
<p class="line" id="line966"><a name="pos966"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I am of the opinion that they hold the same view.</p>
<p class="line" id="line967"><a name="pos967"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> That they don't want to reconcile either with Mr van Zyl?</p>
<p class="line" id="line968"><a name="pos968"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line969"><a name="pos969"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Thank you, no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line970"><a name="pos970"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MARTINI</p>

<p class="line" id="line978"><a name="pos978"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The speaker was unclear, could he repeat his statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line979"><a name="pos979"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Would you just repeat it, the translators didn't get what you said, I am afraid.</p>
<p class="line" id="line980"><a name="pos980"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ECK:</span> Pardon Chairperson, Mr du Plessis on my right, will go ahead of me.</p>

<p class="line" id="line985"><a name="pos985"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Lamera?</p>
<p class="line" id="line986"><a name="pos986"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Is it Lamera?  I think it is incorrectly spelt in the index.  This person, is this person known to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line987"><a name="pos987"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line988"><a name="pos988"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> From the Cape Youth Congress?</p>
<p class="line" id="line989"><a name="pos989"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line990"><a name="pos990"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> As a friend from the same community?</p>
<p class="line" id="line991"><a name="pos991"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Not from the same community, but from a different community, but I know her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line992"><a name="pos992"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> You at a stage, we are talking about 1989, did you know her well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line993"><a name="pos993"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I knew her to an extent, we didn't interact daily, but I knew her, and we went to various meetings, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line994"><a name="pos994"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> So you actually knew her well by the time of this explosion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line995"><a name="pos995"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes, I knew who she was and where she lived, which area she lived, not necessarily which house she lived in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line996"><a name="pos996"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Did you socially interact with her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line997"><a name="pos997"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> On occasion at Youth functions, but not on a daily basis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line998"><a name="pos998"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes.   But, so you did socialise and you did go to the same meetings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line999"><a name="pos999"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1000"><a name="pos1000"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And obviously, if I understand correctly, she was a member of the Cape Youth Congress and one of the senior members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1001"><a name="pos1001"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1002"><a name="pos1002"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> One of the ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1003"><a name="pos1003"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> In terms of her branch, she would have been senior.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1004"><a name="pos1004"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Executive members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1005"><a name="pos1005"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> In terms of her branch, she would have been senior.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1006"><a name="pos1006"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1007"><a name="pos1007"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Not, any way ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1008"><a name="pos1008"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> But in any event she was part of the Executive?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1009"><a name="pos1009"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Regional Executive.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1010"><a name="pos1010"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Regional Executive, yes, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1011"><a name="pos1011"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Correct yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1012"><a name="pos1012"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Then obviously Mr Peter Williams you knew?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1013"><a name="pos1013"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1014"><a name="pos1014"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And also as a friend?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1015"><a name="pos1015"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes, I knew him well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1016"><a name="pos1016"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> At that time?  You knew him very well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1017"><a name="pos1017"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes, very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1018"><a name="pos1018"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Fine.   The next person is Regina Isaacs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1019"><a name="pos1019"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I knew her, I still know her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1020"><a name="pos1020"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> On a social basis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1021"><a name="pos1021"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> On a social basis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1022"><a name="pos1022"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> As a friend?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1026"><a name="pos1026"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Fatima Omar?  Is it the same position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1027"><a name="pos1027"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I knew her, didn't interact with her, but I knew who she was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1028"><a name="pos1028"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Well, did you only know who she was, did you ever attend meeting with her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1029"><a name="pos1029"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1030"><a name="pos1030"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Just tell me by the way, what was your position in the Cape Youth Congress?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1031"><a name="pos1031"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Mine?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1032"><a name="pos1032"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1033"><a name="pos1033"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I was a senior member of the Kewtown Youth Movement.  We were representatives of our movement's meeting on a regional basis.  Not the Cape Youth Congress ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1034"><a name="pos1034"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> You were affiliated to the Cape Youth Congress?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1038"><a name="pos1038"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Regional Executive?  Sorry?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1039"><a name="pos1039"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> We attended regional meetings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1040"><a name="pos1040"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Of what, of the Cape Youth Congress?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1041"><a name="pos1041"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1042"><a name="pos1042"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> As?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1043"><a name="pos1043"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> But I wasn't an official office bearer of the Cape Youth Congress.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1047"><a name="pos1047"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> She was a representative from a different Youth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1048"><a name="pos1048"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Also a Youth organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1049"><a name="pos1049"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is right.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1052"><a name="pos1052"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Thornhill?   And as such you knew her and you attended numerous meetings with her?  Isn't that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1053"><a name="pos1053"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1054"><a name="pos1054"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1055"><a name="pos1055"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1056"><a name="pos1056"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And Nazeema Mohammed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1057"><a name="pos1057"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I knew her as well.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1060"><a name="pos1060"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Also attended many meetings with her, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1061"><a name="pos1061"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1062"><a name="pos1062"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> The following person is Wallace Jonathan Stevens?  Do you know this person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1063"><a name="pos1063"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I knew who he was, he played soccer in the area, but he wasn't resident within the Kewtown area, but I knew who he was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1064"><a name="pos1064"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> You didn't know him socially?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1065"><a name="pos1065"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1066"><a name="pos1066"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> You had no interaction previously with this person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1067"><a name="pos1067"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1068"><a name="pos1068"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> No problems with this person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1069"><a name="pos1069"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1070"><a name="pos1070"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Like, while I am on the point, on the point, you obviously knew Gakkie who testified here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1071"><a name="pos1071"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes, I knew Gakkie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1072"><a name="pos1072"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Did you have problems with him before, personal clashes?  Political, of political nature perhaps?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1073"><a name="pos1073"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> We were on different sides of ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1074"><a name="pos1074"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Of the political spectrum?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1075"><a name="pos1075"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1076"><a name="pos1076"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> He knew that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1077"><a name="pos1077"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> He knew that but we could live together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1078"><a name="pos1078"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> But that wasn't the position with Mr Wallace Stevens?  This Mr Wallace Jonathan Stevens, you didn't have any political associations with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1079"><a name="pos1079"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> No, I didn't have any associations or have any social links with Mr ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1080"><a name="pos1080"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Nothing at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1081"><a name="pos1081"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> With Mr Wallace Stevens.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1082"><a name="pos1082"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> So he is not, it is not for instance known to you that he was, if he was, from the opposite political spectrum or from the same?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1083"><a name="pos1083"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> No.  No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1084"><a name="pos1084"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> He may have been an anti-government person as well?  Do you agree with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1085"><a name="pos1085"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I don't know him in that fashion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1086"><a name="pos1086"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes.  And Terrence Coetzee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1087"><a name="pos1087"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> No, I don't know him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1088"><a name="pos1088"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> So before this incident, you didn't know who Terrence Coetzee was or did you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1089"><a name="pos1089"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Let me just put it into perspective ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1090"><a name="pos1090"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Well, this Mr Terrence Coetzee ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1091"><a name="pos1091"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I don't know him, however that was a soccer union meeting, and we had a rebel league within the Kewtown area.  There were something like 16 soccer teams playing, so they came there, I don't know them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1092"><a name="pos1092"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Fine.  I just want to establish whether you knew this person.  I see he ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1093"><a name="pos1093"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you say you don't know him, you know of him, I mean Terrence Coetzee, now you are talking about somebody belonging to the soccer people, so you know, you have heard the name and you know that he belongs to soccer, but you don't know him, or do you say "I don't know him, I have never heard the name and I am just guessing that he might have been ..."</p>
<p class="line" id="line1094"><a name="pos1094"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I don't know of him in terms of soccer or whatever, but if I were to see him on the soccer field or if I were to see him in the area, I would know he played soccer, but I don't have any interaction  or social ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1095"><a name="pos1095"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you would know him to be Terrence Coetzee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1096"><a name="pos1096"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I wouldn't know him to be Terrence Coetzee, I would just know the face.  It is like ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1097"><a name="pos1097"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So how do you know when Mr du Plessis mentions the name Terrence Coetzee now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1098"><a name="pos1098"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Because I read the statements.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1099"><a name="pos1099"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay, so you know just from your knowledge of these documents?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1100"><a name="pos1100"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Let me just add, the only soccer person I knew there was someone by the nickname of Boere Erickson.  That is the only person I knew in terms of the soccer grouping.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1101"><a name="pos1101"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.   Godfrey Blignaut?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1102"><a name="pos1102"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I don't know him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1103"><a name="pos1103"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> His position is the same as Mr Coetzee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1104"><a name="pos1104"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1105"><a name="pos1105"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> You may have known the face, but not the name?   Sorry?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1106"><a name="pos1106"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1107"><a name="pos1107"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Now, just tell me, you say that you have read the documents, is that referring to the statements to which I was referring now, when I read the names?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1108"><a name="pos1108"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I read it this morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1109"><a name="pos1109"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> You read the statements?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1110"><a name="pos1110"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Because I had the thick book with the hand-written version, and I saw these things.  I didn't basically go out and prepare myself around things like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1111"><a name="pos1111"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Well sir, you said you read the statements?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1112"><a name="pos1112"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes, this morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1113"><a name="pos1113"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Did you read the statements, don't interrupt me please, did you read the statements or didn't you read the statements?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1114"><a name="pos1114"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes, I did this morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1115"><a name="pos1115"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> This, the Cape Youth Congress, Cape Youth Congress, did they meet at the Early Learning Centre regularly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1116"><a name="pos1116"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> No, they did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1117"><a name="pos1117"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> On how many occasions say per year, can you remember, more or less?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1118"><a name="pos1118"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I could almost be certain they could have met there once in two months, or whatever, but it was never part of the venue.  We had floating venues wherever.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1119"><a name="pos1119"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> You had several venues, and it depended on whose turn it was to stage the meeting, is that what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1120"><a name="pos1120"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is right.  That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1121"><a name="pos1121"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> So you would from time to time have a meeting at the Early Learning Centre?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1122"><a name="pos1122"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is a possibility, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1123"><a name="pos1123"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> So, is it possible or not, did it happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1124"><a name="pos1124"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> It is possible, I have just said it is a possibility, yes.  We would have meetings there from time to time, not regularly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1125"><a name="pos1125"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> But you would arrange it for the Early Learning Centre?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1126"><a name="pos1126"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Not necessarily the ELC, it could have been CRIC which is adjacent.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1127"><a name="pos1127"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Sorry?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1128"><a name="pos1128"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> CRIC, Careers Research Information Centre, which is next to the ELC, that same road.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1129"><a name="pos1129"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Did you arrange meetings or did you just go to a certain place and by coincidence, there would be a meeting, obviously you would arrange it beforehand?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1130"><a name="pos1130"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> You would arrange it, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1131"><a name="pos1131"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And you would have arranged it for a specific date, time and venue?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1132"><a name="pos1132"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1133"><a name="pos1133"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Who was responsible for arranging this specific meeting that evening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1134"><a name="pos1134"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I cannot recall whose responsibility it was that evening, but the meeting point would have been CRIC and from there we would have gone to the venue.  CRIC is adjacent to the ELC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1135"><a name="pos1135"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Is it part of the same building?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1136"><a name="pos1136"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Have you got  your map in front of you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1137"><a name="pos1137"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> I have, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1138"><a name="pos1138"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> There is a centre with a blue roof, do you see it clearly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1139"><a name="pos1139"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1140"><a name="pos1140"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is CRIC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1141"><a name="pos1141"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> So are you saying that the meeting was in fact arranged for that building?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1142"><a name="pos1142"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> No, I am not saying, that was the meeting point, outside CRIC, it wasn't arranged for that building.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1143"><a name="pos1143"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Did you meet the people who were supposed to come to the meeting, at that venue that you have just referred to now?  Did you meet them there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1144"><a name="pos1144"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> No, I said I came late, I came there at ten past eight.  I didn't meet them there ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1145"><a name="pos1145"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> (Indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1146"><a name="pos1146"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> They were coming towards the ELC, because they knew we were there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1147"><a name="pos1147"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Alexander, I just cannot quite understand it.  If I attend a meeting at the ELC, why should I go and meet people at CRIC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1148"><a name="pos1148"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1149"><a name="pos1149"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And go from CRIC to there, why can I not go straight there, if the meeting is arranged for the ELC at eight o'clock or whatever?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1150"><a name="pos1150"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> In the era, Your Worship, we would get together at a central point, and from there, we would move to the venue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1151"><a name="pos1151"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, but why get together at a central point, I mean we all came here today from different places, we didn't all meet at the end of the freeway and come in as a group, there is no point in that?  What was the point, why did you meet at a central point to go to a meeting at another place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1152"><a name="pos1152"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> The point was, we were all political activists and we would meet at a particular point and go from there to the venue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1153"><a name="pos1153"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> That still does not explain to us.  I mean if the venue of the meeting was the ELC, why not meet at the ELC?  The problem is if the venue was known, then  you would go to the venue?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1154"><a name="pos1154"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> The venue wasn't known, at the time, it was decided on that evening, that we would meet at the ELC.  The meeting point would have been CRIC and from there we would have gone to a venue, but because we were the closest and our meeting was in process, sort of round about the time, that is when we decided we will use ELC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1155"><a name="pos1155"></a>	But there was never a predetermined matter that the Cayco meeting would be at ELC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1156"><a name="pos1156"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay, because you said to Mr du Plessis that the venue, the date, etc, was arranged, I just assumed that it would have been arranged before that date?  So you all meet at a certain designated point and then there, decided on an ad hoc basis for that night, where to have a meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1157"><a name="pos1157"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1158"><a name="pos1158"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  So that was for purposes of avoiding the wrong people knowing where you were, the wrong people being the authorities of the time, the government, the police, Secret Police, etc?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1159"><a name="pos1159"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is correct, for safety purposes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1160"><a name="pos1160"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> For safety purposes?   So, are you saying that the place where you were actually supposed to meet, would only be decided on once you meet at a specific predesignated point, then you would say "okay, from here we will move to that building and we will have our meeting there"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1161"><a name="pos1161"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> It would be the norm, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1162"><a name="pos1162"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> So you would go to this,  you said CRIC, how do you spell it, by the way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1163"><a name="pos1163"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> C-R-I-C.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1164"><a name="pos1164"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> You would go to CRIC and you would say "okay, from here we will go to that house or that shop or to this building and we will have our meeting there", is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1165"><a name="pos1165"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Not to the end degree, but it would have happened in that manner.  There were only x amount of venues available within the area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1166"><a name="pos1166"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Well, obviously you didn't go, it is now very clear that you wouldn't go to the same place every time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1167"><a name="pos1167"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1168"><a name="pos1168"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> So you would meet at  CRIC and then you would only then decide to go to A, B or C, isn't it so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1169"><a name="pos1169"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1170"><a name="pos1170"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So it was lucky that you found them at the ELC, because you wouldn't have known they were meeting at the ELC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1171"><a name="pos1171"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> No, I was coming to my Youth meeting, to Kewtown Youth Meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1172"><a name="pos1172"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, like I am saying it was fortunate that they happened to choose the ELC to meet that night, after having met at CRIC because you said you were late and didn't go to CRIC, so when you entered the building, you didn't know where the Cape Youth were meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1173"><a name="pos1173"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> No, when I entered, they were standing outside the building, and CRIC is basically on the side, I could see them.  And hence we, from there ad hoc decided we would meet there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1174"><a name="pos1174"></a>	They were standing outside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1175"><a name="pos1175"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry Mr du Plessis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1176"><a name="pos1176"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Sorry, thank you Mr Chairman.  So the fact of the matter is that you didn't know where they would be going, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1177"><a name="pos1177"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Sorry?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1178"><a name="pos1178"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> When you arrived at the Early Learning Centre, you didn't know where the meeting would be, the Cape Youth Congress meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1179"><a name="pos1179"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is right.  It was decided there and then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1180"><a name="pos1180"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Sorry?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1181"><a name="pos1181"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> It was decided there and then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1182"><a name="pos1182"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> But you weren't there?  You weren't present when it was decided?  You weren't at CRIC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1183"><a name="pos1183"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> No, I have just stated now that they were outside CRIC, when I came there, I could see them, I could go and talk to them, that is what my statement also says.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1184"><a name="pos1184"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> So, did you actually then go to CRIC and meet them there?  Did you go there or didn't you go there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1185"><a name="pos1185"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I didn't go to CRIC, they were standing outside, parked on the pavement.  Look at the Exhibit P2, the (indistinct) version is D1 and D2, that is where their cars were parked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1186"><a name="pos1186"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> In any event, let me leave that for a moment.   Did the, perhaps I should see the point, I cannot distinguish.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1187"><a name="pos1187"></a>	The fact of the matter is, I see the building, CRIC and I see the Early Learning Centre, and it is quite some distance apart, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1188"><a name="pos1188"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> It is about 40 metres apart, sir.  40 Metres, and the gate from CRIC to where these guys were parking, was less than 20 metres.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1189"><a name="pos1189"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> So did you in fact communicate by talking to them and asking them where they were going for the meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1190"><a name="pos1190"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> You will see where I parked sir, position C on there, I had to walk across the road, then I saw these guys.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1191"><a name="pos1191"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> But did you go there sir?  Did you go to them and talk to them, that is the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1192"><a name="pos1192"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes, that is right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1193"><a name="pos1193"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> So  you did?  Just answer the question then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1194"><a name="pos1194"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1195"><a name="pos1195"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And then they said that they were going to meet at the ELC, at the Early Learning Centre?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1196"><a name="pos1196"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is right, it was an ad hoc decision.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1197"><a name="pos1197"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Now tell me, at what time was the Kewtown Youth Movement's meeting supposed to take place?  The Kewtown Youth Movement's meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1198"><a name="pos1198"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> We normally met between seven and nine o'clock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1199"><a name="pos1199"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> So was it set for seven o'clock?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1200"><a name="pos1200"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is right, round about there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1201"><a name="pos1201"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And at what time did you arrive there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1202"><a name="pos1202"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Ten past eight.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1203"><a name="pos1203"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And was that then when you met up with the people from the Youth Congress, then you at that stage, ten past eight, you met up with the people of Cape Youth Congress?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1204"><a name="pos1204"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That would be right sir.  And we walked into the foyer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1205"><a name="pos1205"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Of ELC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1206"><a name="pos1206"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1207"><a name="pos1207"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Now, at that stage, was the meeting of the Kewtown Youth Movement adjourned already?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1208"><a name="pos1208"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> It was unwinding, as I have said, people were starting to come out, and people were starting to talk in the foyer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1209"><a name="pos1209"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> So they were standing around socialising?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1210"><a name="pos1210"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1211"><a name="pos1211"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Some of them did in fact leave or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1212"><a name="pos1212"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1213"><a name="pos1213"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Did some of them leave?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1214"><a name="pos1214"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Some of them were outside of the building, some of them smoked, etc.  They only left before our meeting, so between ten past eight and twenty five past eight, people were still around there and people were talking.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1215"><a name="pos1215"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes.  And your meeting of the Cape Youth Congress only started at twenty five past eight?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1216"><a name="pos1216"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1217"><a name="pos1217"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And then only did the people of the Kewtown Youth Movement go home?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1218"><a name="pos1218"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Not then only, when our meeting started, they had gone home already.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1219"><a name="pos1219"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes.   So you, your meeting started about ten minutes before the bomb went off?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1220"><a name="pos1220"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1221"><a name="pos1221"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And while you were standing around there, did you see people from the soccer club who arrived?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1222"><a name="pos1222"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1223"><a name="pos1223"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And when you went into your meeting, were they there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1224"><a name="pos1224"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> They were there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1225"><a name="pos1225"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Where were they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1226"><a name="pos1226"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> They were in the foyer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1227"><a name="pos1227"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Doing what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1228"><a name="pos1228"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> They were chatting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1229"><a name="pos1229"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> They were just standing around, chatting?  How many of them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1230"><a name="pos1230"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> They were seated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1231"><a name="pos1231"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> How many of them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1232"><a name="pos1232"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I saw three, I counted three people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1233"><a name="pos1233"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Three people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1234"><a name="pos1234"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1235"><a name="pos1235"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Did you at that stage, see or could you see the hall in which the bomb exploded?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1236"><a name="pos1236"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Where?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1237"><a name="pos1237"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> From where you were in the foyer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1238"><a name="pos1238"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> In the foyer, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1239"><a name="pos1239"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Could you see it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1240"><a name="pos1240"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes, I could see the hall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1241"><a name="pos1241"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Were the lights on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1242"><a name="pos1242"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1243"><a name="pos1243"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> You saw it personally, you could see into the hall?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1244"><a name="pos1244"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1245"><a name="pos1245"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And you saw that the lights were on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1246"><a name="pos1246"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> You must remember that the people from the Kewtown Youth Movement was coming out of the hall, I could see it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1247"><a name="pos1247"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> I see.  And actually if I understand you correctly, until shortly before your meeting started, there were still some of the Kewtown Youth Movement's people in the hall, in the hall itself, where the bomb exploded?  They were standing around there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1248"><a name="pos1248"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Not in the hall, outside of the hall, but as you, if you look at your front entrance, there are two sets of doors.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1249"><a name="pos1249"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1250"><a name="pos1250"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> On the one hand side, on the right, there are those windows which you open, almost like (indistinct) windows, on top of one another, which you pull down with one of those things, you can see if the light is burning there.  There are no curtains.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1251"><a name="pos1251"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes, fine, but the situation is that you are saying that the situation is that you personally looked into the hall?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1252"><a name="pos1252"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I could see from where I was standing that the light was burning, I didn't go and open the door.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1253"><a name="pos1253"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Okay, were the doors closed?  Were the doors closed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1254"><a name="pos1254"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> It could have been, but when the people from Kewtown Youth Movement exited, the lights were on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1255"><a name="pos1255"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Could you see them exit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1256"><a name="pos1256"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1257"><a name="pos1257"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> So you saw them walking out of the door?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1258"><a name="pos1258"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1259"><a name="pos1259"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And if you could see them walking out of the door, you could see into the hall?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1260"><a name="pos1260"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1261"><a name="pos1261"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Then the doors were open, sir?  Isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1262"><a name="pos1262"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Well, those doors have got those pulley arms, they can close again.  If you don't open it completely wide, it closed automatically sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1263"><a name="pos1263"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Did anyone open it completely wide, or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1264"><a name="pos1264"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Not to my recollection.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1265"><a name="pos1265"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Did you see, yes or no?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1266"><a name="pos1266"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Not to my recollection, they didn't open it completely wide.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1267"><a name="pos1267"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Do you still remember that they didn't open it completely wide?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1268"><a name="pos1268"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Well, from my memory it is clear that they didn't open it completely wide.  Because those doors (indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1269"><a name="pos1269"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Either you remember that the doors were open wide and were standing open, or you remember ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1270"><a name="pos1270"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> They were not standing open.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1271"><a name="pos1271"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Or you remember that they weren't open completely, or you cannot remember, one of three, which one do you choose?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1272"><a name="pos1272"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> The doors were not open completely sir, so they automatically closed thereafter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1273"><a name="pos1273"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> All right, you can clearly remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1274"><a name="pos1274"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1275"><a name="pos1275"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry Mr du Plessis, I just want to get some clarity, while you are on this point.  Photograph 5, was there glass in the doors?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1276"><a name="pos1276"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes, it was a glass door.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1277"><a name="pos1277"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So what difference does it make if it is closed or not, could you see through the glass?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1278"><a name="pos1278"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes.  It was that ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1279"><a name="pos1279"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So why are you making a distinction whether the door was open or not open if you can see through the glass?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1280"><a name="pos1280"></a>	If the door were closed at that time, could one be in the foyer and see people sitting in the hall, through the glass or was there curtaining or was the glass painted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1281"><a name="pos1281"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> The glass wasn't painted, I think there was curtaining on the top side of the glass.   You will see, it must have had four panes of window, four window panes, the top ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1282"><a name="pos1282"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Looking at this photo, I cannot see.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1283"><a name="pos1283"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> But right on top, you could see that ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1284"><a name="pos1284"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I cannot see the remnants of curtains?  Yes, it might be.  Anyway ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1285"><a name="pos1285"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> But you could see the lights were on inside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1286"><a name="pos1286"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> From the top?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1287"><a name="pos1287"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> From the top.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1288"><a name="pos1288"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  If you look at the door, it is obviously completely blown out there, were there glass panes in there, in the door?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1289"><a name="pos1289"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes, there were glass panes in the door.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1290"><a name="pos1290"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> So you could see through there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1291"><a name="pos1291"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> No, I think the top part, there were four panes in the door, the top part had curtains, but if you look at photograph 1, if you stand in the foyer, you look through those double doors, you see those windows on top there, you can see the lights there, clearly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1292"><a name="pos1292"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> But it is just interesting that you would after all the years, specifically remember that no one cared to open the doors open wide, so that they wouldn't swing shut in the next person's face.  Why do you remember that so well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1293"><a name="pos1293"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Sir, some things you remember, some things you don't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1294"><a name="pos1294"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> But you know if you remember some small detail like that, there is normally something which make you remember that, like a beautiful blond coming out and letting the door go and letting it smash into someone's face, something like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1295"><a name="pos1295"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Blondes might excite you sir, it does not excite me.  With all due respect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1296"><a name="pos1296"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes, but the point is any good looking lady excites me, but anyway  the point I wish to make is that there is nothing on which, to which you could refer and say this is why I remember it, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1297"><a name="pos1297"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Sir, the point is that that door had pulleys on it, and I knew when we walked in towards the boardroom, the doors were closed, so it had to close by itself.  I remember it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1298"><a name="pos1298"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> You are saying when you walked into the foyer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1299"><a name="pos1299"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> No, when I walked in towards the boardroom to the Cayco meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1300"><a name="pos1300"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1301"><a name="pos1301"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> The doors were closed, I remember it.  I am just that type of guy, I can remember certain things if I wanted to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1302"><a name="pos1302"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And from that fact now you say that it wasn't previously opened wide, and that is why they were shut when you walked to the boardroom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1303"><a name="pos1303"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1304"><a name="pos1304"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> The fact of the matter is sir, they could have been opened wide, and someone could have come like the night watchman and closed it, do you agree with me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1305"><a name="pos1305"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1306"><a name="pos1306"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> The point is you are saying to me, and I will get to the relevance of this point, you are saying to me that why you remember that the doors were not opened wide, is because of the fact that when you went into the boardroom for the Cape Youth Congress meeting, the doors were closed, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1307"><a name="pos1307"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1308"><a name="pos1308"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> So they must have swung closed automatically?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1309"><a name="pos1309"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1310"><a name="pos1310"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1311"><a name="pos1311"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> And before that, I fully agree, that is correct, but before that, I was in the foyer all along, so I would have remembered that Jack, the caretaker, come and close the door, but he didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1312"><a name="pos1312"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Sir, there were many people around in the foyer, isn't it? They were standing socialising there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1313"><a name="pos1313"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1314"><a name="pos1314"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Correct, smoking as you said?  Correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1315"><a name="pos1315"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1316"><a name="pos1316"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Were you talking to people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1317"><a name="pos1317"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I think I should have?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1318"><a name="pos1318"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes, sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1319"><a name="pos1319"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1320"><a name="pos1320"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> So did you have any reason to specifically note whether the night watchman was coming or going, walking around there, did you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1321"><a name="pos1321"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I knew how Jack acted around people, Jack was a shy guy, but beyond that I was an inquisitive guy, I looked around.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1322"><a name="pos1322"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Did you have any reason to note what the night watchman was doing, yes or no?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1323"><a name="pos1323"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> No, but I knew that he would never come and interfere if people were still around, he would come and or close if there was no one in the building.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1324"><a name="pos1324"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Would he always wait until the whole building was vacated before he would go to a specific place, a specific hall or a specific room and lock that, is that what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1325"><a name="pos1325"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Come again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1326"><a name="pos1326"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Did you know his comings and goings and the way he did his work to such an extent that you can say that he would never lock a specific room or a specific hall if there was any person still present in the building, is that what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1327"><a name="pos1327"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I can clearly say that sir, because the hall didn't have a lock like a key that you put in and turn, that he could do to lock the hall, was to put the chain across the arms of the door.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1328"><a name="pos1328"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And was it done?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1329"><a name="pos1329"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> It was not done.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1330"><a name="pos1330"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Was it done to lock the hall on occasion, if it was necessary?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1331"><a name="pos1331"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> It was very seldom done.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1332"><a name="pos1332"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> But it was done sometimes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1333"><a name="pos1333"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes, but then you would see the chain.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1334"><a name="pos1334"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, I am not understanding this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1335"><a name="pos1335"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, are you suggesting, sorry, I just want to be clear, are you putting a version to him that the hall was locked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1336"><a name="pos1336"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Mr Lax, I will get to that, I will refer to documents.  I cannot put a version to him, because I haven't got instructions on that, and my people weren't there, but it is a very important point, and I will get to some documentation.  I will not belabour the point any longer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1337"><a name="pos1337"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry Mr du Plessis.  Was Mrs Beulah Fredericks there that night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1338"><a name="pos1338"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> She was there earlier the evening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1339"><a name="pos1339"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What (indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1340"><a name="pos1340"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> In fact what would have happened is ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1341"><a name="pos1341"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, what is early in the evening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1342"><a name="pos1342"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Just before, at about, just after eight she left as well.  When I came there, she was still there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1343"><a name="pos1343"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1344"><a name="pos1344"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.   Mr Peter Williams, was he also supposed to attend the meeting of the Cape Youth Congress that evening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1345"><a name="pos1345"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Excuse me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1346"><a name="pos1346"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Was Mr Williams also supposed to attend the meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1347"><a name="pos1347"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> He went to the meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1348"><a name="pos1348"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Was he supposed sir, to attend the meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1349"><a name="pos1349"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1350"><a name="pos1350"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> So he was, this is a regional meeting and because of his position, if I am now understanding it correctly in the Kewtown Youth Movement, he was supposed to attend?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1351"><a name="pos1351"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1352"><a name="pos1352"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> It was not an open meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1353"><a name="pos1353"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1354"><a name="pos1354"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Only specific people were invited?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1355"><a name="pos1355"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1356"><a name="pos1356"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And was he invited?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1357"><a name="pos1357"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1358"><a name="pos1358"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> He knew about the meeting?  Did he know about the meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1359"><a name="pos1359"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes, that is right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1360"><a name="pos1360"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Was he informed and notified about the meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1361"><a name="pos1361"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> He knew about the meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1362"><a name="pos1362"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> How did you know, were you people notified by phone, by letter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1363"><a name="pos1363"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> We would telephonically be advised about the meeting, and we would have links daily with other people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1364"><a name="pos1364"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Which other people sir, the people attending the meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1365"><a name="pos1365"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is right, for instance Regina worked at UWC for the SRC, I would link up with her daily and so would Peter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1366"><a name="pos1366"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes, you had daily links to all these people I mentioned here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1367"><a name="pos1367"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1368"><a name="pos1368"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Of the Cape Youth Congress, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1369"><a name="pos1369"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Not all, but some of the people in the area, closer to us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1370"><a name="pos1370"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Fine, but the fact of the matter is, he knew he had to attend the meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1371"><a name="pos1371"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1372"><a name="pos1372"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And you say they had to start at what time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1373"><a name="pos1373"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Excuse me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1374"><a name="pos1374"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> The Cape Youth Congress meeting had to start when?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1375"><a name="pos1375"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> The time that people were supposed to be meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1376"><a name="pos1376"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1377"><a name="pos1377"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> At CRIC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1378"><a name="pos1378"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1379"><a name="pos1379"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Not what time the meeting started, the pick up point would have been CRIC, it would have been passed eight.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1380"><a name="pos1380"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> No sir, if someone tells me to be at a specific point passed eight, I wouldn't know when to be there.  What was the specific time, was there a specific time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1381"><a name="pos1381"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Eight or soon thereafter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1382"><a name="pos1382"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And when would the meeting then convene?  As soon as you get to the point where you have the meeting, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1383"><a name="pos1383"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is correct, it could, that point could be three, or four, or five kilometres away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1384"><a name="pos1384"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Fine.  Do you go to this specific point in cars?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1385"><a name="pos1385"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Excuse me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1386"><a name="pos1386"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Were you supposed to go by car to this specific meeting point?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1387"><a name="pos1387"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Not necessarily.  Some people came by foot, some people came by car.  Depending where, in which area you were and there were always enough lifts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1388"><a name="pos1388"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> What I mean is, you meet at CRIC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1389"><a name="pos1389"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1390"><a name="pos1390"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Now from there you move to the point where you decide to have the meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1391"><a name="pos1391"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1392"><a name="pos1392"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> So it depends whether, how far it is?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1393"><a name="pos1393"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes.  No, no, if you go to CRIC and for instance say we would go to St George's Hall, we would take our cars there, but everyone who came to CRIC, might not necessarily have cars.  You could get into another car, as easy as that, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1394"><a name="pos1394"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> I see.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1395"><a name="pos1395"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> We shared.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1396"><a name="pos1396"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> You see, why I am asking you this as well, Mr Williams also made a statement and in his statement he says the following</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1397"><a name="pos1397"></a>"... at that stage (referring to after the adjournment of the Kewtown Youth Movement meeting) other people arrived who were also holding a meeting, they were from the Cape Youth Congress.  At that stage we stood outside the building.  The people from the Cape Youth Congress then asked me if they could also make use of the building.  I then told them that they could use the building."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1398"><a name="pos1398"></a>	Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1399"><a name="pos1399"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Where are you referring to, just for the record?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1400"><a name="pos1400"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> I am reading at page 213, Mr Chairperson, bundle D, page 213.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1401"><a name="pos1401"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Can I answer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1402"><a name="pos1402"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1403"><a name="pos1403"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I cannot remember the detail, but I have already told you that we decided on an ad hoc basis that we would meet at the ELC on that night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1404"><a name="pos1404"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes.  But it is clear, I put it to you, from this, that Mr Peter Williams who was supposed to attend the meeting, does not seem as if he was aware that there was a meeting, and he wasn't notified?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1405"><a name="pos1405"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> No, he would have been notified.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1406"><a name="pos1406"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> But you agree with me in the way that he states it here, it does not seem as if he was aware of such a meeting taking place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1407"><a name="pos1407"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is your opinion sir.  I would have to agree, but he was notified.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1408"><a name="pos1408"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1409"><a name="pos1409"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, are you saying you assume that he was notified, or do you know personally as you sit here, that he was in fact notified?  Were you present when he was notified or did you notify him  yourself, what are you saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1410"><a name="pos1410"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Your Worship, it would be my assumption, because we had links with other people daily, at UWC, within the area, with other Youth.  I am assuming at this point that he was notified.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1411"><a name="pos1411"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  You see we find the same in Nazeema Mohammed's statement on page 226 where she says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1412"><a name="pos1412"></a>"... on that night we asked Peter Williams if we could use one of the building's rooms for our meeting.  He agreed and all of us ..."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1413"><a name="pos1413"></a>	and then she carries on, the same aspect?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1414"><a name="pos1414"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Sir, I said that we decided on an ad hoc basis that we would meet there, so that is it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1415"><a name="pos1415"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> But he is supposed to know about the fact that he will have to go to CRIC otherwise he will miss the meeting, may I remind you, was set for eight or as soon as possible thereafter, and we don't find any indication in Mr Williams' statement that indicates that he was aware that he had to go to CRIC to meet up with you people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1416"><a name="pos1416"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Sir, the Cayco meeting didn't come out of a vacuum, it was publicised to the branches, to the members at Executive level and yes ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1417"><a name="pos1417"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Did you have agendas and minutes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1418"><a name="pos1418"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1419"><a name="pos1419"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Did you have that available for that evening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1420"><a name="pos1420"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1421"><a name="pos1421"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> What happened to those documents sir, you had a meeting, so surely some of it had to be noted before the bomb exploded.  What happened to those minutes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1422"><a name="pos1422"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I wasn't the Secretary at that meeting, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1423"><a name="pos1423"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And what happened to the agenda, because you had an agenda for the evening, correct, which would state the date and the time, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1424"><a name="pos1424"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes.  It wasn't a typed agenda, it was something that we would prepare amongst ourselves.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1425"><a name="pos1425"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> You would prepare ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1426"><a name="pos1426"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Amongst ourselves, we would prepare amongst ourselves.  I am not the Secretary to that forum.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1427"><a name="pos1427"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes.  And let's have a look at this, in Shinaaz Limera's statement on page 209, she states</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1428"><a name="pos1428"></a>"... On the  31st of August (that is page 209, bundle D) at approximately eight o'clock, I was at the Early Learning Centre in Springbok Street, Athlone, to attend a meeting of the Cape Youth Congress (sorry Mr Chairman, this I cannot really make out this part of the handwriting) we held our meeting ...</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1429"><a name="pos1429"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Mr du Plessis, it is on page 1 of bundle D.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1430"><a name="pos1430"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Bundle D?   Let me read then again, paragraph 1, page 1,  bundle D</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1431"><a name="pos1431"></a>"... when we entered the building, there were already people inside the building.  We held our meeting in the boardroom.   On the same date, at approximately 20H35, I heard a loud noise ..."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1432"><a name="pos1432"></a>	and from this nothing appears of the fact that these people of the Cape Youth Congress were going to meet at CRIC at about eight o'clock?  Here it is stated as a virtual fact that at eight o'clock this good lady was at Early Learning Centre, Athlone, and that the meeting was in progress as from then, do you agree with me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1433"><a name="pos1433"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> In terms of the statement, but I must say that I know from my experience that the meeting started at 25 past eight, in terms of Cayco.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1434"><a name="pos1434"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Sorry Mr Chairman, let me just - see the same goes for the statement of Fatima Omar, referring again to bundle D, page 224.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1435"><a name="pos1435"></a>"... On the 31st of August 1989, after eight o'clock, I arrived at the Early Learning Centre, Athlone, to attend a meeting of the Cape Youth Congress.  The meeting started at about 20H30."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1436"><a name="pos1436"></a>	Which is more in accordance with what you say.  The fact of the matter is also this lady does not mention anything about CRIC or the fact that you first had to give the necessary, get the necessary permission to use this hall?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1437"><a name="pos1437"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> The ELC is adjacent to CRIC, sir, they were standing outside.  What more do you need?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1438"><a name="pos1438"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> The same Nazeema Mohammed, page 226 once again</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1439"><a name="pos1439"></a>"... at the 31st of August 1989, at about eight o'clock, I had a meeting with the members of Cape Youth Congress at the Early Learning Centre, Athlone ..."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1440"><a name="pos1440"></a>	You see, let me get straight to the point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1441"><a name="pos1441"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1442"><a name="pos1442"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> We have in the same bundle, that is bundle D, pages 228 up to page 237, we have three statements by more or less objective people of the soccer club, who were unfortunate enough to be in the building, however not in the hall, when the bomb exploded.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1443"><a name="pos1443"></a>	Let me deal with them quickly.  First of all, let me refer to page 231, the statement of Terrence Coetzee.  This is the gentleman of whom you said that you would recognise his face if you see him, correct?  You had no political or personal problems with him before, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1444"><a name="pos1444"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> If he was in the area, and I see his face, I might have known him.  But I would know the face.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1445"><a name="pos1445"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes.  You see this statement, I am referring to the typed version now, page 233, 234, from this it appears that this statement was made in April 1990, which is about six months before you people made your statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1446"><a name="pos1446"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1447"><a name="pos1447"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> I am referring to paragraph 2</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1448"><a name="pos1448"></a>"... On Thursday, 31 August 1989, at quarter past eight, I arrived at the Early Learning Centre, in Springbok Street, Kewtown, to attend a certain meeting.  We held the meeting in the foyer of the centre, because the hall was locked."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1449"><a name="pos1449"></a>	The hall was locked?  Do you see that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1450"><a name="pos1450"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Sir, the doors were closed, not locked.  I cannot see that, I don't have it in front of me, but the only way you could lock those doors, was by chains.  There wasn't a lock that you could turn, I told you that earlier.  That is an assumption...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1451"><a name="pos1451"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> The fact of the matter is, this gentleman wanted to attend a meeting, and from the other statements it is clear that it is alleged that this meeting had to take place in the very hall where the bomb exploded, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1452"><a name="pos1452"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1453"><a name="pos1453"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> I think we find it in your own statement that the soccer people had to use the hall, therefore you had to use the boardroom, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1454"><a name="pos1454"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1455"><a name="pos1455"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> So one would assume that this good gentleman who wanted to attend a meeting in the hall, would at least have a look whether the hall is open or not?  He would at least test the doors?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1456"><a name="pos1456"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is your assumption sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1457"><a name="pos1457"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1458"><a name="pos1458"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> The doors were not locked, the doors were closed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1459"><a name="pos1459"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Mr Chairman, I am often accused of not being a student of Afrikaans, but I seem to remember people saying, going out of this doors "sluit die deur", it doesn't mean lock.  "Sluit" does not mean lock, Mr Chairman?  It can be, but it certainly isn't, it means closed or locked and I know whenever this arises, my Afrikaans speaking friends often tell me I don't understand Afrikaans.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1460"><a name="pos1460"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman, I don't think that Mr Bizos would be able to save the moment.  The point is, what this gentleman is saying that they had to use the foyer, you would agree with me firstly that that wouldn't be a normal place to have a meeting, do you agree with me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1461"><a name="pos1461"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Sir ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1462"><a name="pos1462"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Just answer the question, do you agree with me, yes or no?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1463"><a name="pos1463"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> No, I don't agree, they were a few members at a time, they were waiting on their members, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1464"><a name="pos1464"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Let's leave that point and move on, the fact of the matter is that this person says he gives a reason why they had to use the foyer.  The reason which is advanced is because the hall was locked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1465"><a name="pos1465"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I repeat sir, the hall wasn't locked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1466"><a name="pos1466"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> That is your version?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1467"><a name="pos1467"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> The only way you could lock, no, because I knew, I was familiar with the centre, I would go there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1468"><a name="pos1468"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry Mr du Plessis.  Mr Bizos, my understanding, reading it in the context of the sentence, is that it must obviously mean that it was locked, because you don't not hold a meeting merely because the door was closed, which you could easily open and go in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1469"><a name="pos1469"></a>	In the context of that to find that it was not locked, would be a bit absurd, I think, with respect, and I am certainly not a student of Afrikaans.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1470"><a name="pos1470"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Could you please have a look at paragraph 3, sir?  Page 14, of another statement</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1471"><a name="pos1471"></a>"... but I do not know if it was locked."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1472"><a name="pos1472"></a>	That is on page 14 of ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1473"><a name="pos1473"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, I am just looking at this ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1474"><a name="pos1474"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> A different statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1475"><a name="pos1475"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I am just looking at this particular one, if one reads this sentence</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1476"><a name="pos1476"></a>"... we held the meeting in the foyer of the centre, because the hall was locked."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1477"><a name="pos1477"></a>	I think there any interpretation would be that it was locked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1478"><a name="pos1478"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> (Indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1479"><a name="pos1479"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I am not concerned with the other, but just that particular one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1480"><a name="pos1480"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes, it may be, (indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1481"><a name="pos1481"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And I am not saying whether this person is correct or not, but just on that ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1482"><a name="pos1482"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> I will concede in that context, but the other statement of the other soccer players ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1483"><a name="pos1483"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, I haven't got ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1484"><a name="pos1484"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> I suppose my learned friend will ask some questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1485"><a name="pos1485"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes, thank you, Mr Chairman, indeed I have to, because these statements do not make any sense to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1486"><a name="pos1486"></a>	Now, referring to the people of the Cape Youth Congress, not the soccer players, sir, I will proceed.  At least this one gentleman says that the hall was locked, and the other two say that the doors were closed, but they do not know whether it was in fact locked.  The position is further that referring to another statement of Mr Godfrey Blignaut, also a person you say which you cannot say you had any dealings with before, no bias of any nature between the two of you as far as you know, do you agree?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1487"><a name="pos1487"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I agree.  I told you earlier.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1488"><a name="pos1488"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Right, now Mr Godfrey Blignaut made his statement also long before you did yours, on the 6th of December 1989, referring to page 235 to 237 of bundle B.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1489"><a name="pos1489"></a>	He says the following ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1490"><a name="pos1490"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr du Plessis, have you got a reference, a page number?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1491"><a name="pos1491"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Page 235, Mr Chairman of bundle B.  My learned friend can perhaps assist me if there is a typed written one.  It is not in the typed written one, it is page 235 at the bottom, virtually at the bottom.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1492"><a name="pos1492"></a>	Let me just read it from a little bit higher up.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1493"><a name="pos1493"></a>"... Terrence and I, it was our club (then there is a name mentioned) and delegates.   The meeting was said to begin at eight o'clock, but by 20H35 it was only the five of us.  With the exception of the black caretaker who was in the building, I am not aware of any other persons in the building.  I noted that the hall doors were closed, I don't know if anyone was inside."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1494"><a name="pos1494"></a>	Then he goes on to say on page 236 in paragraph 4, inter alia that after the explosion, they went to the caretaker who was in his room, they found him there.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1495"><a name="pos1495"></a>"... all five of us went through the door."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1496"><a name="pos1496"></a>	Sorry he says -</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1497"><a name="pos1497"></a>"... they found the backdoor with his assistance."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1498"><a name="pos1498"></a>	On this point, the following, you see according to your evidence, you and even the people of the Kewtown Youth Movement, were standing around in the foyer, and then at a certain stage, about 20H25 you went into the boardroom, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1499"><a name="pos1499"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is correct, just before then, yes.  Our meeting started at twenty five past eight.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1500"><a name="pos1500"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes, you had to, do you go to the boardroom from the foyer, or do you go out of the building to do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1501"><a name="pos1501"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> No, we came via the foyer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1502"><a name="pos1502"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> You were in the foyer and from there you moved into the boardroom section?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1503"><a name="pos1503"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1504"><a name="pos1504"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> So for anyone sitting around in the foyer, it must be clear that people are moving into the boardroom, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1505"><a name="pos1505"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes, depending what time a person came there, that is right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1506"><a name="pos1506"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> In fact it is very clear from this gentleman's statement that he was there from about eight o'clock and that he was there with five other people.  For some reason sir, he is totally unaware of your presence in the boardroom.  Can you explain that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1507"><a name="pos1507"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry Mr du Plessis, just to be absolutely clear, put your question correctly, he was there from about quarter past eight, according to his statement.  That is Mr Blignaut?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1508"><a name="pos1508"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes, thank you.  20H15, and that would be before you moved into the boardroom, on your own evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1509"><a name="pos1509"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> 20H15, yes, that is correct.  It was, as I have said earlier, between ten past eight and the time I came there, and 25 past, just before 25 past, we were in the ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1510"><a name="pos1510"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Well, it is very clear from your evidence that just before the meeting convened at 25 past, you moved into the boardroom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1511"><a name="pos1511"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1512"><a name="pos1512"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> So this gentleman as well as the others, must have seen you?  I will argue on the papers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1513"><a name="pos1513"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I would assume that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1514"><a name="pos1514"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And for some reason, some mysterious reason, these people who have no reason to lie about the incident, never saw anyone moving into the boardroom, do you agree with me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1515"><a name="pos1515"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is a mysterious reason, I would ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1516"><a name="pos1516"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Sir, there is nothing mysterious I would submit to this Committee about their statements, but what I would be saying, what I am going to argue is that it cannot be accepted on your evidence, and on the evidence contained in these statements that you were at the hall at the time that the bomb went off.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1517"><a name="pos1517"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Sir ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1518"><a name="pos1518"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Please, let Mr Alexander answer the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1519"><a name="pos1519"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Sir, I was in the hall when the bomb exploded.  I promise you I was in there, I don't have any reason to lie about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1520"><a name="pos1520"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> You see, that explains why Mr van Zyl never saw the cars there, because you weren't there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1521"><a name="pos1521"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> The cars were definitely there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1522"><a name="pos1522"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> You had left, if you were there before?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1523"><a name="pos1523"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> The cars were definitely there, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1524"><a name="pos1524"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Let's move on.  I will return to this statement, because obviously the clients I represent, were not there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1525"><a name="pos1525"></a>	But they gave certain instructions to the subordinates or Mr Botha and Mr van Zyl ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1526"><a name="pos1526"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Please, all this talking is interrupting the proceeding, please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1527"><a name="pos1527"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> That is to see to it that people were not hurt and that in fact sir, is what eventually happened, no one was seriously hurt or people did not have to be killed, and that is what happened eventually?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1528"><a name="pos1528"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Sir, the fact is by chance no one was seriously hurt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1529"><a name="pos1529"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes, let's just proceed for a moment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1530"><a name="pos1530"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> By chance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1531"><a name="pos1531"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> You see, your statement, all right, let me just cover this point with you quickly.  You already described to us how you left the centre and you went to park your car at a certain place, you wanted to remove your car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1532"><a name="pos1532"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> The vehicle, the bakkie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1533"><a name="pos1533"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Was that so that the police couldn't or shouldn't see your car?  You didn't want your car to be seen at the scene?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1534"><a name="pos1534"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is correct, because we would then be linked in terms of the police saying "it was definitely you guys."  It was a limpet mine of Russian origin and "you guys had the political motive."</p>
<p class="line" id="line1535"><a name="pos1535"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes, so your political sentiments were well know, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1536"><a name="pos1536"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1537"><a name="pos1537"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> At that time.  It was known that the Cape Youth Congress was affiliated to the UDF, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1538"><a name="pos1538"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1539"><a name="pos1539"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> The UDF's sentiments as far as the ANC is concerned, was already also well know, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1540"><a name="pos1540"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Sorry?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1541"><a name="pos1541"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> The UDF's sentiments as far as supporting the ANC as a front organisation was well known?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1542"><a name="pos1542"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> A front organisation in which regard sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1543"><a name="pos1543"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Sorry?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1544"><a name="pos1544"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> In which regard?  They had support for the ANC, but they were not involved in acts of terror or violence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1545"><a name="pos1545"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes well, I didn't say that, I don't know why you mention it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1546"><a name="pos1546"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I am clarifying it, because you are leaving it open to interpretation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1547"><a name="pos1547"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> The point is sir, that you were afraid that because of the knowledge that the police had of your personally and some of the other people, that you would be linked to the bomb, isn't it?  Why should they think that ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1548"><a name="pos1548"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Out of fear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1549"><a name="pos1549"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Sorry?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1550"><a name="pos1550"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Out of fear I left, I took my car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1551"><a name="pos1551"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Why should the police think that you were responsible for exploding the bomb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1552"><a name="pos1552"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Because I was an activist.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1553"><a name="pos1553"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Sorry?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1554"><a name="pos1554"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Because I was an activist.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1555"><a name="pos1555"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes, an activist on which the police had correctly or wrongly, had information that you were involved in for instance, disrupting the elections, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1556"><a name="pos1556"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Disrupting the elections in which - by educating people, by telling people what is right and wrong, they make up their own minds?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1557"><a name="pos1557"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes, but the police for some reason, according to you and I will respect your evidence in that regard, for some reason the police were under the misapprehension that you were an activist involved in violence, isn't that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1558"><a name="pos1558"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> No ways.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1559"><a name="pos1559"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1560"><a name="pos1560"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1561"><a name="pos1561"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And I believe Mr Peter Williams who was closely associated with you, was locked up under the Internal Security Act, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1562"><a name="pos1562"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Mr Chairperson, there is no evidence to that effect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1563"><a name="pos1563"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He is asking that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1564"><a name="pos1564"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Chairperson, he put it to the witness himself, to Mr van Zyl.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1565"><a name="pos1565"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, I think it is fair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1566"><a name="pos1566"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> I will get the record, he put it to van Zyl himself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1567"><a name="pos1567"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You can continue with that if you want, Mr du Plessis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1568"><a name="pos1568"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Thank you.  I am referring to page 4, bundle D, where it is said that</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1569"><a name="pos1569"></a>"... in terms of the Emergency Regulations, he was detained from 28th of October 1985 to the 10th of November and again in 1986"?</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1570"><a name="pos1570"></a>	That is what Mr Williams says himself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1571"><a name="pos1571"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes, but under which circumstances?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1572"><a name="pos1572"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Sorry?  I am not going into that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1573"><a name="pos1573"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I am just saying you are trying to draw your own things here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1574"><a name="pos1574"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1575"><a name="pos1575"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Under which circumstances?  He was a school pupil at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1576"><a name="pos1576"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Mr Alexander, I am not trying to attack you, do you understand?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1577"><a name="pos1577"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> No, I know that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1578"><a name="pos1578"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> I am not trying to do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1579"><a name="pos1579"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I am just trying to give a bigger picture, because you are painting half the picture.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1580"><a name="pos1580"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes, I am saying that apparently there was the impression in your, in the society of which you were a member, Athlone, which we heard from Gakkie, that you were an activist and he was at least under the impression that some of your members were involved in violence?  Do you agree with me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1581"><a name="pos1581"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is his assumption.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1582"><a name="pos1582"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> It was his assumption?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1583"><a name="pos1583"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1584"><a name="pos1584"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And like it was his assumption, you would agree with me, it could have been the impression of many other people of the same society?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1585"><a name="pos1585"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I don't agree with that sir, because we had the support of the people of that society at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1586"><a name="pos1586"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes, you had the support, but there were obviously people like the person who is going to stand for parliament in the tricameral dispensation, who also agreed with Gakkie, if it was only him and Gakkie, I don't know.  do you know, there were other people supporting the government of the day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1587"><a name="pos1587"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Should have been.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1588"><a name="pos1588"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes.  So, you will not be able to deny that there were people who were referring to you people in your own terms, as activists, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1589"><a name="pos1589"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1590"><a name="pos1590"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And associating you people with violence, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1591"><a name="pos1591"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1592"><a name="pos1592"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And because, well, I am not saying you were involved with violence, but that is the impression which could have been formed by certain people in the community?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1593"><a name="pos1593"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That was an impression formed by Gakkie, most probably for money, for the reasons of money.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1594"><a name="pos1594"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Sir, are you denying that anyone else could have formed that impression, are you denying that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1595"><a name="pos1595"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I am not saying that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1596"><a name="pos1596"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes, exactly.  And even ill-meaning people, people who disagreed with your politics, could have gone to the police, giving them false information that you were involved in violence, do you agree with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1597"><a name="pos1597"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> They could have, but they didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1598"><a name="pos1598"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> But you were very ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1599"><a name="pos1599"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> It is a fact.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1600"><a name="pos1600"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> You say as a fact that no one went to the police linking your organisation, the Cape Youth Congress, or any other organisation ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1601"><a name="pos1601"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Linking Kewtown Youth Movement with violence, never, we were never picked up for any acts of public violence, whatsoever.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1602"><a name="pos1602"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> But you were not attending a meeting, according to you, of the Cape Youth Congress, associated with the UDF?  Do you agree with me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1603"><a name="pos1603"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1604"><a name="pos1604"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> So sir, do you exclude the possibility that anyone could have gone to the police accusing you of violence and being involved with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1605"><a name="pos1605"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I cannot exclude that, but Cayco was a vast organisation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1606"><a name="pos1606"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Because I must say, getting back to the point, that according to your statement sir, I find the following - let me just get to the point, paragraph 3 on page 220 of bundle B</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1607"><a name="pos1607"></a>"... shortly after the explosion, all the members of the Cape Youth Congress left."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1608"><a name="pos1608"></a>	You went home, you left the place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1609"><a name="pos1609"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> We didn't go home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1610"><a name="pos1610"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Well, you left?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1611"><a name="pos1611"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I took my car away and I came back there.  I didn't stay there for very long either.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1612"><a name="pos1612"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes, you see the point is you don't even say that you moved your car, but we know why you moved your car?  You didn't want to be associated with the explosion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1613"><a name="pos1613"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is correct, precisely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1614"><a name="pos1614"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Because you were afraid that the police were going to connect you and your organisation with the explosion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1615"><a name="pos1615"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1616"><a name="pos1616"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> So obviously it stands to reason that the police must have had some reason even if it was only gossip, that you people were involved with violence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1617"><a name="pos1617"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> With respect, the evidence has been Mr Chairman, and we all know, that part of the dirty tricks campaign was to have "dekstories", putting the blame on other people.  The fact that the witness may have feared of such a "dekstorie", is one thing, but to say that that it is evidence that the people were connected, is a complete (indistinct), with respect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1618"><a name="pos1618"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Thank you.  I welcome the assistance of Mr Bizos, but the fact is that you were at least afraid that because of the dirty trick campaign by the police, you could have been linked, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1619"><a name="pos1619"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is a fact.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1620"><a name="pos1620"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes.  And just to conclude that point, you would obviously agree that it is quite possible that ill-meaning people of your community, supplied information which eventually got to the CCB, that you people were a bunch of gangsters involved in violence?  It is possible that that information could have gotten to the CCB, quite incorrectly as it now appears to be?  Do you agree?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1621"><a name="pos1621"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> It is possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1622"><a name="pos1622"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes.   Now ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1623"><a name="pos1623"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> There wouldn't be any ill-meaning people within the community, we were well accepted within the community, we assisted the community all the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1624"><a name="pos1624"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes, fine, except, obviously except, with the exception of Gakkie and similar people?  Correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1625"><a name="pos1625"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1626"><a name="pos1626"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> People you would describe as gangsters in turn?  You would describe Gakkie as a gangster?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1627"><a name="pos1627"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1628"><a name="pos1628"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Mr van Zyl also described it as that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1629"><a name="pos1629"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes.  Mr Chairman, I am not going to state my opinion of him, it is irrelevant, but the fact is, I am asking the witness whether he was describing him as a gangster, I am not putting it in dispute.  Maybe the worst gangster we have seen.  Do you agree with me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1630"><a name="pos1630"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I answered it, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1631"><a name="pos1631"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And how many gangsters were in that community, sir?  How many?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1632"><a name="pos1632"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Quite a number, but ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1633"><a name="pos1633"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Quite a number?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1634"><a name="pos1634"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1635"><a name="pos1635"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes.   Enough said about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1636"><a name="pos1636"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Perhaps, when we get to a convenient stage, we can take the lunch adjournment, Mr du Plessis.  Just finish, yes, I think and then we will continue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1637"><a name="pos1637"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Just put your button on, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1638"><a name="pos1638"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Sorry, just getting to the last aspect.   I also find it very interesting sir, that Nazeema Mohammed makes a statement, bundle B, page 226, and I find her reaction to the bomb explosion very interesting, about at the bottom third of the page</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1639"><a name="pos1639"></a>"... I didn't see at that stage (let me read from the typed written page 13, bundle B) anything is wrong with the building, and I then immediately went to my Attorneys, hence I suffered no injuries."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1640"><a name="pos1640"></a>	Not very elegantly put, but she rushed off to her Attorneys.  Do you know the reason for that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1641"><a name="pos1641"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Panic, fear?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1642"><a name="pos1642"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Fear of the police, fear of being picked up and arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1643"><a name="pos1643"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1644"><a name="pos1644"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1645"><a name="pos1645"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is an assumption.  I cannot talk for her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1646"><a name="pos1646"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Sorry?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1647"><a name="pos1647"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is an assumption,  I cannot talk for her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1648"><a name="pos1648"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes, that will be your only conclusion, why else would she go to her Attorney?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1649"><a name="pos1649"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1650"><a name="pos1650"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> She didn't sustain any injuries, she didn't know who put up the bomb, so she wouldn't be able to claim civilly from them?</p>

<blockquote class="line" id="line1652"><a name="pos1652"></a>"... Bruce Malgas met Gakkie Hardien at a party.  He told us that he missed us, but that we should watch his next move.  We understood by that that he referred to the bomb explosion."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1653"><a name="pos1653"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> ...(start of new tape) that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1654"><a name="pos1654"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1655"><a name="pos1655"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> So it was a few weeks after the 31st of August, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1656"><a name="pos1656"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1657"><a name="pos1657"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> At that stage, who was your attorney?  Did you have an attorney?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1658"><a name="pos1658"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I didn't have an attorney at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1659"><a name="pos1659"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Or this attorney who protected you or represented you when these statements were taken, who was this person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1660"><a name="pos1660"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I told that we were approached by ...(indistinct) Joshua.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1661"><a name="pos1661"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1662"><a name="pos1662"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I further told you that there was an attorney and other guys from Jo'burg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1663"><a name="pos1663"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes.  Now ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1664"><a name="pos1664"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> But beyond that, Gakkie bragged in the area that planted the bomb.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1665"><a name="pos1665"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Sorry?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1666"><a name="pos1666"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Beyond that, Gakkie bragged in the area, after the bomb blast it was a well known fact in the area that Gakkie planted the bomb.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1667"><a name="pos1667"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Now this was a very serious crime wasn't it, to set off a bomb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1668"><a name="pos1668"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes, it was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1669"><a name="pos1669"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And the centre was extremely seriously damaged at least.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1670"><a name="pos1670"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1671"><a name="pos1671"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And some people apparently got slightly hurt, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1672"><a name="pos1672"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1673"><a name="pos1673"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Now I suppose you would immediately say to me you didn't approach the police because you didn't trust the police, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1674"><a name="pos1674"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That's a fact.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1675"><a name="pos1675"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Now did the police know anything about you Sir, were they biased against you?  Did the police at that stage consider you as an activist against the government?  The police of Athlone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1676"><a name="pos1676"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> The police of Athlone?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1677"><a name="pos1677"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1678"><a name="pos1678"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I would assume that, Sir.  Van Zyl's brother worked there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1679"><a name="pos1679"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Sorry?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1680"><a name="pos1680"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Van Zyl's brother worked in Athlone at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1681"><a name="pos1681"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Sir, the fact is, what was your impression at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1682"><a name="pos1682"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> My impression of any police officer at that stage was that he was an agent of the government.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1683"><a name="pos1683"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> He was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1684"><a name="pos1684"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> An agent of the government.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1685"><a name="pos1685"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1686"><a name="pos1686"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> He was there to protect and further apartheid.  You don't understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1687"><a name="pos1687"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> You knew about attorneys, I'm sure, at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1688"><a name="pos1688"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1689"><a name="pos1689"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> You knew that an attorney could protect your interests, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1690"><a name="pos1690"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> To a fact, but limited.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1691"><a name="pos1691"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Well legal representatives in general, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1692"><a name="pos1692"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes, but only to a limited extent because the order of the day was still there, they could still protect themselves.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1693"><a name="pos1693"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes, the fact of the matter is, here this person is not only admitting that he planted the bomb, he's now threatening obviously to kill him, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1694"><a name="pos1694"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That's right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1695"><a name="pos1695"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Did you understand it that way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1696"><a name="pos1696"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That's right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1697"><a name="pos1697"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Did you go to an attorney, Sir, to assist you and protect your interests, to write to the Minister of Justice or the Commissioner of Police?  Did you do that, yes or no?  Did you approach an attorney Sir, yes or no?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1698"><a name="pos1698"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> No, I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1699"><a name="pos1699"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Why not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1700"><a name="pos1700"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Sir, you must take the epoch into consideration, you know that the State, the Security Police, there was other dirty tricks departments which had the protection of the State, why would we go and do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1701"><a name="pos1701"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Are you saying that all attorneys and legal advisers were working for the government, Sir, and sympathetic to the government?  Do you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1702"><a name="pos1702"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Most of them were.  Most of them were at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1703"><a name="pos1703"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Most of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1704"><a name="pos1704"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> There was an elite group of attorneys which took care of our interests.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1705"><a name="pos1705"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Fine, and you knew about the elite group of attorneys.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1706"><a name="pos1706"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> To an extent.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1707"><a name="pos1707"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> People like - well not an attorney, but distinguished advocate, like Mr Bizos.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1708"><a name="pos1708"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1709"><a name="pos1709"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> You knew about them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1710"><a name="pos1710"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I wasn't in contact with them at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1711"><a name="pos1711"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> But you knew about them, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1712"><a name="pos1712"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I should have known about them, that's right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1713"><a name="pos1713"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And you would agree with me, Sir, that you realised at that stage, or you should have realised at least, that if you went to such a distinguished gentleman attorney or advocate, that at least they could place on record that there was such a threat that this person, Gakkie, was responsible for setting off a bomb and he was now again threatening you.  So that if something does happen to you in the future, at least people would know where to look to, to solve the crime, do you agree with me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1714"><a name="pos1714"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes, I know, but I told Gakkie straight I'm not afraid of him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1715"><a name="pos1715"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Sir, the question still is, why didn't you take further steps?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1716"><a name="pos1716"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Because he had the protection of the State at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1717"><a name="pos1717"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And the last point, I put it to you Sir, that the real situation is this, you were not, and that's what I'm going to argue to this Committee eventually, you were not present when the bomb exploded.  There was no crime against you and a later stage, in 1990, you people conspired, the people making these statements, except the people from the soccer club, conspired to give this evidence that you were in the building and that Gakkie and Van Zyl and Botha should have known that because of certain factors you mention in your statements.  Isn't that the true position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1718"><a name="pos1718"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> It is an untruth.  At no stage is there a conspiracy and you can go and get those soccer people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1719"><a name="pos1719"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Just to tie this all up, the fact of the matter is you, all of you made your statements only at the end of October, 30th of October, and one person on the 1st of November, correct?  In 1990, more than a year after the explosion.  You agree with me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1720"><a name="pos1720"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That's right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1721"><a name="pos1721"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And you were all represented by the same attorney.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1722"><a name="pos1722"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1723"><a name="pos1723"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes.  And at that stage Sir, you had read widely in the press about Mr van Zyl and Botha and what Mr van Zyl was saying, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1724"><a name="pos1724"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Please, you want me to believe that I was doing the wrong thing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1725"><a name="pos1725"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Well Sir, I don't want ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1726"><a name="pos1726"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I promise you, the fact is things were coming to the fore, but we were in that building when it exploded.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1727"><a name="pos1727"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Why don't you want to answer my question, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1728"><a name="pos1728"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> What is your question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1729"><a name="pos1729"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> My question is simple, at that stage when you made your statement you already read widely in the press about Van Zyl and what he was saying, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1730"><a name="pos1730"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> It was known, I testified to that effect earlier, but I didn't know the detail of what he was saying in his Section 29 or any other statements.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1731"><a name="pos1731"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Well Sir, by that time the Harms Commission also concluded its, the Harms Commission brought out its report already, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1732"><a name="pos1732"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Sir, I'm a layman, I don't read ....</p>
<p class="line" id="line1733"><a name="pos1733"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> But the fact is you read papers, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1734"><a name="pos1734"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I read papers, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1735"><a name="pos1735"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> You watch television, Sir, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1736"><a name="pos1736"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> It's a fact.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1737"><a name="pos1737"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> You cannot exclude the possibility that by the 30th of October you read in the press and heard on the television that Van Zyl was denying that he wanted to hurt anyone, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1738"><a name="pos1738"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Sir, we were in the building, Van Zyl tried to kill us.  I couldn't put it to you in more simple terms, whether you believe me or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1739"><a name="pos1739"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Once again you're not answering my question for some reason.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1740"><a name="pos1740"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Come with your question again, I'll tell you now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1741"><a name="pos1741"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> I'm putting this to you, that you cannot exclude the possibility that you read in the papers or heard on television that Van Zyl was in fact denying that he wanted to hurt or kill anyone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1742"><a name="pos1742"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I can't exclude that possibility, but I can ...(break in tape) in the building at the time.  That's a fact.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1743"><a name="pos1743"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> And what I'm putting to you Sir, is that this attorney came to you and you and your friends, fellow people, persons from the Cape Youth Congress who were politically inclined to do the same thing, came together and you conspired to make these statements and to make it clear in these statements that Van Zyl and Botha should have known because of the fact that there were vehicles or there were people moving in and out, etcetera, etcetera.  And I ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1744"><a name="pos1744"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That is facts Sir, whether you like it or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1745"><a name="pos1745"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> I am therefore not willing to accept on these papers and statements that in fact you people, the people who made these statements, were present at the Early Learning Centre when the bomb went off.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1746"><a name="pos1746"></a>	Thank you, Mr Chairman, that is all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1747"><a name="pos1747"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR P DU PLESSIS</p>
<p class="line" id="line1748"><a name="pos1748"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes thank you, we'll take the lunch adjournment now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1749"><a name="pos1749"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> Mr Chairman, may I interrupt, I have only two or three questions at most, would it be possible to conclude that because we've made arrangements.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1750"><a name="pos1750"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, Mr Wessels.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1751"><a name="pos1751"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1752"><a name="pos1752"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Has my learned friend Mr du Plessis finished, Mr Chairman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1753"><a name="pos1753"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, Mr du Plessis is finished and Mr Wessels just wants to ask a few questions, he says he's got a very few questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1754"><a name="pos1754"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.  Mr Chairman, I merely want to place on record that this suggestion that is made by Mr du Plessis who has no specific instructions from Mr van Zyl or Mr Calla Botha, and to do it for the, to suggest that such a conspiracy exists at the very end of these proceedings, Mr Chairman, is a matter which we submit is completely unacceptable and to which we will particularly refer to during the argument, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1755"><a name="pos1755"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes thank you, Mr Bizos.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1756"><a name="pos1756"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Mr Chairman, may I just say, obviously I do not have any such instructions, but the fact of the matter is that it was suggested by Mr Bizos himself that there were no specific instructions that people should not be killed or hurt.  In fact, Mr Bizos' argument or what he put to all the witnesses is that in fact the plan was to kill as many of the members of the Kewtown Youth Movement as possible, and therefore I have to investigate this matter.  And may I say, Mr Chairman, that these document were made available to me and there was no earlier stage at which I could make such allegations because there were no witnesses who were called before.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1757"><a name="pos1757"></a>	Furthermore, may I just before I forget, I see that in Mr Williams' statement there is reference to a further statement which he has made and which is not part of these bundles.  I'm referring to page 211 of bundle B, paragraph 1.  There's mention of a statement which he made on the 19th of March, I suppose it's 1990, obviously it can't be '89, and I would ask respectfully Mr Chairman, that this statement be obtained by my learned friend, Ms Coleridge, if it is not one of the statements we have at hand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1758"><a name="pos1758"></a><span class="speaker">MS COLERIDGE:</span> I just want to refer you to ... it is in bundle D.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1759"><a name="pos1759"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> It starts on page 212.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1760"><a name="pos1760"></a><span class="speaker">MS COLERIDGE:</span> It's also the typed version in bundle D, Chairperson, page 3 to 4.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1761"><a name="pos1761"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Mr Chairman, the statement starting on 212 to 217 is dated the 30th of October 1990, now there's mention in paragraph 1 of a statement made on the 19th of March.  Otherwise I just don't understand it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1762"><a name="pos1762"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where it says ...</p>

<p class="line" id="line1766"><a name="pos1766"></a>and then you give that it was made, not only on the 19th of March 1990, but at 10.36 in the morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1767"><a name="pos1767"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Yes, to Detective-Sergeant Lloyd.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1768"><a name="pos1768"></a><span class="speaker">MS COLERIDGE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1769"><a name="pos1769"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I recall seeing some statement, it's just like a declaration, it doesn't say much I remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1770"><a name="pos1770"></a><span class="speaker">MS COLERIDGE:</span> Chairperson, if you look at bundle D you will note on page 2 is the statement that he made on the 30/10/90, where he refers to the previous statement made on the 19/3/90, and if you turn the page, on page 3 and to page 5, you will note there it's dated there 19/3/90, the bottom of the page.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1771"><a name="pos1771"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman, I see that, I will accept it for the moment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1772"><a name="pos1772"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So it seems that they're there, Mr du Plessis.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1776"><a name="pos1776"></a>	Mr Alexander, Mr Williams made a statement, the one on the 30th of October 1990, wherein he says in paragraph 1:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1777"><a name="pos1777"></a>"I just want to state it clearly that on the evening of 31 August 1989 I held a meeting with members of the Kewtown Youth Movement.  After we had concluded the meeting we went outside where the members who were with me went home."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1778"><a name="pos1778"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Which one is this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1779"><a name="pos1779"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> Will you accept that position as being correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1780"><a name="pos1780"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It's bundle D, page 2 and it's paragraph 1 of the statement, the typed version.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1781"><a name="pos1781"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> That's the second sentence of that paragraph.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1782"><a name="pos1782"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That's not correct.  Peter stayed behind for the Cayco meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1783"><a name="pos1783"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> I see.  No, afterwards he says then that he stayed behind, but the people that were with him all went home then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1784"><a name="pos1784"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Oh yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1785"><a name="pos1785"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> The Kewtown Youth Movement members or the people who attended that meeting then all left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1786"><a name="pos1786"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That's right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1787"><a name="pos1787"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> So would you accept then that anyone outside who saw these people leaving, these Kewtown Youth Movement members leaving, would then be under the impression that that was the end of the meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1788"><a name="pos1788"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes and no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1789"><a name="pos1789"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> Well why do you say no?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1790"><a name="pos1790"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Well people who knew us in the area would know I'm driving, (a), and would see us walk together all.  If they could identify us by name, they would know who would have left and who would not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1791"><a name="pos1791"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> Alright.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1792"><a name="pos1792"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, Mr Wessels.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1793"><a name="pos1793"></a>	But you'll concede that if they saw a group of people leaving the building, they'd assume that at least one meeting was over?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1794"><a name="pos1794"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Ja, that's right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1795"><a name="pos1795"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> Mr Alexander, you said that you're not afraid of Gakkie, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1796"><a name="pos1796"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes, I'm not afraid of him, today I'm still not.  I can walk past him without any fear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1797"><a name="pos1797"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> You never were afraid of him, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1798"><a name="pos1798"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I'm not afraid of Gakkie, but I was afraid of the State.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1799"><a name="pos1799"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> Yes.  Just listen ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1800"><a name="pos1800"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The question was, Gakkie ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1801"><a name="pos1801"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I'm not afraid of Gakkie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1802"><a name="pos1802"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> You have never been afraid of Gakkie.  You see there was a newspaper clipping read out to Gakkie when he gave evidence, where he had stated in the newspaper about</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1803"><a name="pos1803"></a>"That he was the iron hand of Kewtown"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1804"><a name="pos1804"></a>or words to that effect.  You remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1805"><a name="pos1805"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I heard it here for the first time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1806"><a name="pos1806"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> Yes, no yesterday it was read out to him.  Now that seems to me as if those are the words of a braggart who wanted to be important and to create the impression that he is powerful.  Would you agree with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1807"><a name="pos1807"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That's right.  The way he carried himself yesterday was of a similar nature.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1808"><a name="pos1808"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> Yes.  And wasn't it of a similar nature on the evening of the party where you told you that he'd missed you but next time you must watch your move?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1809"><a name="pos1809"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Gakkie basically came and confronted us, he wanted to fight, we walked away and that is what he told us.  It wasn't just as simple as talking, he wanted to physically attack us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1810"><a name="pos1810"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> But he said that next time he'll get you, as if he could get you with a bomb or something like that.  That's the impression you gained.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1811"><a name="pos1811"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That's right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1812"><a name="pos1812"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> Wasn't that just a matter of "groot praat"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1813"><a name="pos1813"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I don't think so.  I know Gakkie for a very long time, Sir, so I don't think so.  But I'm not fearful of him as a person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1814"><a name="pos1814"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> If it hadn't been "groot praat", then surely you would have been afraid because you thought that he had the assistance of the State, in your mind you knew or heard that he put off the bomb, then you must have been scared of him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1815"><a name="pos1815"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Scared of his connections, not scared of Gakkie.  There's a big difference.  But you can infer that ...(indistinct), but I'm not scared of him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1816"><a name="pos1816"></a><span class="speaker">MR WESSELS:</span> Yes.  Thank you Mr Chairman, I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1817"><a name="pos1817"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR WESSELS</p>
<p class="line" id="line1818"><a name="pos1818"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We'll take the lunch adjournment now, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1819"><a name="pos1819"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Chairperson, sorry, can we just get an indication because if we have to re-arrange flights, how long we're going to be.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1820"><a name="pos1820"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well I don't know at all, there's still questioning to be done by Mr Hockey, Mr Williams, Mr Coetzee, Mr van Eck.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1821"><a name="pos1821"></a><span class="speaker">COUNSEL:</span> Mr Chairman, I've got no further questions and I'm likewise going to ask whether I can be excused, I believe this anyway has nothing to do with my client.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1822"><a name="pos1822"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Certainly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1823"><a name="pos1823"></a><span class="speaker">COUNSEL:</span> At this stage Mr Chairman, I can also indicate that after Mr du Plessis I've got no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1824"><a name="pos1824"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> Mr Chairperson, I can just indicate I'll be five minutes, no more than that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1825"><a name="pos1825"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> If they can be finished by 2 o'clock, then I would suggest we carry on through the lunch hour and adjourn at two.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1826"><a name="pos1826"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> There will also be re-examination by Mr Bizos.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1827"><a name="pos1827"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> ;  ...(indistinct - no microphone) 15 minutes, I'm sure that we ...(indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1828"><a name="pos1828"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do we want to proceed now and then break for lunch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1829"><a name="pos1829"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes, try and finish.  I would like to accommodate my learned friends.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1830"><a name="pos1830"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I'm just thankful that we didn't carry on last night, we would have sat till after midnight I think.  Yes, we'll carry on then.  Mr Williams, do you have any questions you'd like to put to Mr Alexander?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1831"><a name="pos1831"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR WILLIAMS:</span> Yes thank you, Mr Chairman, just a few questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1832"><a name="pos1832"></a>	Oesman, do you know who was Peaches' attorney at the stage where he revealed his involvement with the CCB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1833"><a name="pos1833"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I think it was Mr Adams and/or Mr Joshua.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1834"><a name="pos1834"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> Is that the same Mr Adams or Joshua that you referred to in your earlier evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1835"><a name="pos1835"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1836"><a name="pos1836"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Adams and/or Mr Joshua, is that one person with two names, or is it two different people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1837"><a name="pos1837"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> Two different people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1838"><a name="pos1838"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> From the same company or completely apart?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1839"><a name="pos1839"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> Same firm I think, at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1840"><a name="pos1840"></a>	Would you agree that the name is actually Huxley Joshua and not Joshua ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1841"><a name="pos1841"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Sorry, I get confused, but it's Huxley Joshua.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1842"><a name="pos1842"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> And in what year did you join the Kewtown Youth Movement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1843"><a name="pos1843"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Either late '82 or early '83.  1983 or '82.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1844"><a name="pos1844"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> And then in a statement you mentioned names of people that attended the Cayco meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1845"><a name="pos1845"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1846"><a name="pos1846"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> Now Naziema Mohamed is one of the names that you mentioned, do you know where Naziema Mohamed lived at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1847"><a name="pos1847"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes, I knew where she lived.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1848"><a name="pos1848"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> Where?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1849"><a name="pos1849"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> She lives in District 6, or the - adjacent to District 6.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1850"><a name="pos1850"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> That's close to Cape Town, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1851"><a name="pos1851"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Cape Town, ja.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1852"><a name="pos1852"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> Do you think in the normal course of events that she would have walked to Athlone?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1853"><a name="pos1853"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> No, she would not have walked to Athlone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1854"><a name="pos1854"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> Fatiema Omar, where did she live at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1855"><a name="pos1855"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> She lived in the Thornhill/Gatesville area, Rylands, which is also about 7 or 8 kilometres away from where the centre is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1856"><a name="pos1856"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> Shanaaz Limera, where did she live?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1857"><a name="pos1857"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Shanaaz Limera lived in Hanover Park and that was even a bit further away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1858"><a name="pos1858"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> Do you think that Shanaaz or Fatiema would have walked from their homes to Kewtown?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1859"><a name="pos1859"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> No, they would not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1860"><a name="pos1860"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you know how they got from their homes to Kewtown?  Did they catch a taxi or did they come in a car driven by themselves, or what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1861"><a name="pos1861"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> It's either a car driven by themselves or they would, one of the other executive members from their branch would bring them or drop them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1862"><a name="pos1862"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you saying "would" or do you know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1863"><a name="pos1863"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That was the norm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1864"><a name="pos1864"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> Miranda Abrahams, did she live in Kewtown?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1865"><a name="pos1865"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> She lived in Silvertown.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1866"><a name="pos1866"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> Regina Isaacs, did she live in Kewtown?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1867"><a name="pos1867"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> No, she didn't live in Kewtown either.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1868"><a name="pos1868"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> Now you've stated - Mr Martini asked you something relating to possible reconciliation with Slang van Zyl, did you discuss this issue with all of the victims, or are you assuming that people would not want to reconcile with him if you'd want to reconcile with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1869"><a name="pos1869"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I'm assuming from their actions, because he's telling the - he's not telling the truth here.  We're sitting in the audience, we're not discussing it, you can see their body language, the way they react.  So in my opinion they would not reconcile with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1870"><a name="pos1870"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> Now do I understand that to mean that you do not, or that you cannot state as a fact that the other victims would not want to reconcile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1871"><a name="pos1871"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> You are correct, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1872"><a name="pos1872"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> Now Mr du Plessis has shown you certain untested statements of some of the soccer people that were in the building that night.  Are you sure that the version that you've given to us here is the correct version?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1873"><a name="pos1873"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> It's the correct version, it's the truth.  You can't bend the truth, it's absolute.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1874"><a name="pos1874"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> Do you know whether Dr Boesak had ever been detained under the emergency regulations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1875"><a name="pos1875"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I can't recall, but he might have been.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1876"><a name="pos1876"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> Or do you know whether Dullah Omar had ever been detained under the emergency regulations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1877"><a name="pos1877"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I think he was picked up on a number of occasions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1878"><a name="pos1878"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> Does it therefore follow that he was involved in violent actions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1879"><a name="pos1879"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> No, that's - being picked up and being detained without trial doesn't mean that you have ever been involved in anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1880"><a name="pos1880"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think this is a question of argument, I don't think we need evidence on that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1881"><a name="pos1881"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> And then my last question to you is, why would you want to conspire with a group of people to falsely implicate anyone, what do you stand to gain from it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1882"><a name="pos1882"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I stand to gain nothing, I just want the truth.  Hurt.  And I want them to admit to the truth, that's all, so that we can reconcile.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1883"><a name="pos1883"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAMS:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairperson, I've got no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1884"><a name="pos1884"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR WILLIAMS</p>
<p class="line" id="line1885"><a name="pos1885"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you, Mr Williams.  Mr Hockey?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1886"><a name="pos1886"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR HOCKEY:</span> Thank you, I've just got two aspects that I want to clear up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1887"><a name="pos1887"></a>	Mr Alexander, when you were at the Early Learning Centre, did you see Gakkie at all there that evening?  Before the bomb.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1888"><a name="pos1888"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I can't recall, I came a bit late.  I don't think I saw him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1889"><a name="pos1889"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOCKEY:</span> So you're not aware of the discussion he had with Mr Williams?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1890"><a name="pos1890"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1891"><a name="pos1891"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOCKEY:</span> There were suggestions that people were identified as they were leaving the meeting that evening, there were suggestions that the people, well Mr van Zyl, Mr Calla Botha and Gakkie Hardien, when they were standing at the back of the building, that they saw Mr Williams coming out of the building.  Now did Mr Williams at any stage leave the building towards the back, according to your knowledge?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1892"><a name="pos1892"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1893"><a name="pos1893"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOCKEY:</span> Was Mr Ferndale at that meeting at any point that evening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1894"><a name="pos1894"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> He wasn't there at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1895"><a name="pos1895"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOCKEY:</span> Did you see Mr Ferndale there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1896"><a name="pos1896"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> No, he wasn't there at all that evening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1897"><a name="pos1897"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOCKEY:</span> So the suggestion that Mr Ferndale could have been identified leaving the building that evening, can't be true?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1898"><a name="pos1898"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> It's not true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1899"><a name="pos1899"></a><span class="speaker">MR HOCKEY:</span> Thank you, that's all questions I have, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1900"><a name="pos1900"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR HOCKEY</p>
<p class="line" id="line1901"><a name="pos1901"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Bizos, do you have any re-examination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1902"><a name="pos1902"></a><span class="speaker">RE-EXAMINATION BY MR BIZOS:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1903"><a name="pos1903"></a>	Now I want to place some facts before the Committee, so that Mr du Plessis may consider apologising to you for what he put to you.  Firstly, this business of being got together by an attorney and making statements to him in a conspiracy in order to falsely implicate his clients and those that put on the bomb directly.  Would you please have a look at the statements, I'll merely read out the dates and the times and who took the oath, in order to show that the statements were really taken by members of the Police Force from ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1904"><a name="pos1904"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ... on that Mr Bizos, I think each statement contains a police number, a docket number.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1905"><a name="pos1905"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> A docket number and everything else, but also that it was sworn to before a police officer from Brixton.  I'll just put this record for the attention of the Committee.  First of all, that Shanaaz Limera, she gave her statement to Sgt Lloyd of Brixton Murder and Robbery, as did Naziema Mohamed, also on the 30/10/90.  The first one is to be found at page 210, the second is to be found at page 227.  I am referring to bundle D, Mr Chairman, the pages on which the oath is sworn.  It will appear that some of the statements on that very day, the same day Mr Chairman, were taken by, also by Lloyd is Miranda Abrahams, which appears on page 221.  And Mr Chairman, the statements of Peter Williams was taken seven months before, Mr Chairman, this alleged conspiracy took place, in which his presence and the presence of others and the holding of a second meeting is dealt with, which blows up completely the suggestion that there was a conspiracy in October, a year later, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1906"><a name="pos1906"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes I think this is argument now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1907"><a name="pos1907"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Let me just place the facts.  That there was a statement on the 19/3/90, Mr Chairman, and the contents of that document are consistent with the witness' evidence.  Then we have W/O Rossouw who took the witness' statement, Mr Chairman, and you'll find the statement at page 221.  Regina Isaacs, which you will find at page 223 and Fatima Omar, which you will find at page 225.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1908"><a name="pos1908"></a>	Now can you recall whether there were police officers that took your statement down, a police officer took your statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1909"><a name="pos1909"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I cannot recall, but I knew there were a couple of people with this legal guy from Jo'burg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1910"><a name="pos1910"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> You didn't know that they were police officers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1911"><a name="pos1911"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1912"><a name="pos1912"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Did they ask you questions and did they record the statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1913"><a name="pos1913"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I recorded the statement.  I spoke from memory at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1914"><a name="pos1914"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> You spoke from memory at the time that they recorded the statement.  And then Mr Chairman, we have the Stevens statement taken by the Security Police in Cape Town on 14/7/90, we'll find that at page 230, and Terrence Coetzee on the 18th April '90, which you will find at 234.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1915"><a name="pos1915"></a>	Now I'll go onto another topic, Mr Chairman. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1916"><a name="pos1916"></a><span class="speaker">MR P DU PLESSIS:</span> Sorry Mr Chairman, can I just say that I never disputed the fact that these statements were taken by policemen, etcetera, that's not my argument.  I had to point out certain inconsistencies in the statements and especially some specific aspects dealt with by Mr Martini.  So I'm not saying that these people forged these statements and that the police were never present and that these statements were never taken up in a police docket.  That's not my argument.  Just to make it clear to Mr Bizos.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1917"><a name="pos1917"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.  Mr Chairman, it's not something that I can leave in the air.  Mr du Plessis said that "after you learnt of the Van Zyl and Gakkie's involvement in the Harms Commission, then you decided in October for the first time, to talk about there being another meeting".  That is contradicted by Mr Williams' statement of March 1990, Mr Chairman, and I will leave it to Mr du Plessis to take the matter further during these proceedings or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1918"><a name="pos1918"></a>	Now we have seen Gakkie here and he said that he was never afraid of being arrested because he had the protection of the police and the government, do you recall that evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1919"><a name="pos1919"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I recall that evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1920"><a name="pos1920"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> When he was making admissions to you and speaking out in the community and making threats, did he have that same attitude?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1921"><a name="pos1921"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Exactly the same attitude.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1922"><a name="pos1922"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And were there any substantive facts which were known to you, which made you believe that his confidence that nobody would do anything to him, was well founded?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1923"><a name="pos1923"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> To an extent he was bragging about it.  Surely there were police informants within the community, no-one picks him up.  Why wouldn't it be?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1924"><a name="pos1924"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well we have also heard that although he made a statement and he admitted it in 1989, he told us that nobody has asked him about it, he was not prosecuted and he has been leading the life of a free person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1925"><a name="pos1925"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1926"><a name="pos1926"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> So his assumption that he had the protection of the police, at least for some of the, that early period, was well justified?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1927"><a name="pos1927"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> It was justified, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1928"><a name="pos1928"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.  In relation to his - your reconciling with Gakkie, how do you view Gakkie's continued employment at R1 500 a month doing unspecified work?  Do you think that he's become reconciled or has he broken away from the loyalty he felt to Mr van Zyl?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1929"><a name="pos1929"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> He's still loyal to Mr van Zyl and he's, still today he doesn't realise that he's being used.  Or he realises, but he doesn't want to accept it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1930"><a name="pos1930"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.  You said that you were afraid of the Security Police, you haven't in part answered the question, did you have to be a violent person or a bomber to be afraid of the Security Police during the apartheid years?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1931"><a name="pos1931"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> No, you just had to be an activist, be associated with the Mass Democratic Movement and they would pick you up for no reason, you could be detained, you could even disappear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1932"><a name="pos1932"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> You were also asked rather forcefully, by Mr du Plessis, what happened to the documents of the Youth Congress and you said you were not the secretary.  Was this a professional organisation, did you have filing cabinets or did you keep agendas on file and record?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1933"><a name="pos1933"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> No Sir, we did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1934"><a name="pos1934"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Would you like to see their documents?  They had files.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1935"><a name="pos1935"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I'm sure they had.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1936"><a name="pos1936"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR BIZOS</p>
<p class="line" id="line1937"><a name="pos1937"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Mr Chairman, that concludes my re-examination, but what I would like before the adjournment is if we could by agreement, place the motor car that Mr van Zyl, Mr Calla Botha - on Exhibit P1 and P2, Mr Chairman.  For the sake of completeness, I think it will be helpful so that people don't have to go to the record searching for it.  But this was a matter within the observation of the Members of the Committee, I think that you have got a note and a clear recollection of where it was.  If we can't agree, then perhaps we should leave it to you, Mr Chairman and the Members of the Committee, to merely put it in as the next letter of the alphabet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1938"><a name="pos1938"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes I think if you can try to agree, but before we do that I'd just like to ask my colleagues if they have any questions of Mr Alexander.  Sorry, Ms Coleridge first.  Do you have any questions to ask Mr Alexander?  I should have asked that before re-examination, I'm sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1939"><a name="pos1939"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR COLERIDGE:</span> No, that's fine, Chairperson.  I just wanted to ask him one question in relation to the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1940"><a name="pos1940"></a>	You said there were a lot of police present after the bomb had occurred.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1941"><a name="pos1941"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Yes, correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1942"><a name="pos1942"></a><span class="speaker">MR COLERIDGE:</span> Did any of the policemen take any statements from any of the witnesses at the scene of the incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1943"><a name="pos1943"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Not as far as I can remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1944"><a name="pos1944"></a><span class="speaker">MR COLERIDGE:</span> No statements were taken.  Do you know whether they came back to the centre, maybe a day or two later, requesting persons to make statements?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1945"><a name="pos1945"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I think they came back to the centre, 'cause I spoke to Beula Fredericks that time and she gave a statement to the police I think.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1946"><a name="pos1946"></a><span class="speaker">MR COLERIDGE:</span> And did she inform the police of the persons that were in the building at the time the incident had occurred?  Did she forward with any names to the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1947"><a name="pos1947"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I don't know the content of her statement to the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1948"><a name="pos1948"></a><span class="speaker">MR COLERIDGE:</span> Thank you Chairperson, I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1949"><a name="pos1949"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS COLERIDGE</p>
<p class="line" id="line1950"><a name="pos1950"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Sibanyoni, do you have any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1951"><a name="pos1951"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Just one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1952"><a name="pos1952"></a>	Mr Alexander, the people who were attending the meeting of the Cape Youth Congress, basically were people representing structures.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1953"><a name="pos1953"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1954"><a name="pos1954"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> And those, for example, who were not representing structures but were members of some other structures in the community, am I correct?  In other words like yourself, you were not an executive of a smaller structure but you attended that meeting.  Did I understand you correctly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1955"><a name="pos1955"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I was on the executive of Kewtown Youth Movement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1956"><a name="pos1956"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> And Williams was not in the executive?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1957"><a name="pos1957"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> He was on the Kewtown Youth Movement's executive as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1958"><a name="pos1958"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Basically my question is, as a result the meeting of the Cape Youth Congress was closed to ordinary members of the public.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1959"><a name="pos1959"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1960"><a name="pos1960"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Unlike that one of the Kewtown Youth Movement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1961"><a name="pos1961"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> It was open to members of our level, that's right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1962"><a name="pos1962"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Yes.  Thank you, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1963"><a name="pos1963"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you, Mr Sibanyoni.  Mr Lax?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1964"><a name="pos1964"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Thanks, Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1965"><a name="pos1965"></a>	Just to follow up on that, what was your actual position in the Kewtown Youth Movement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1966"><a name="pos1966"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> At the time I was ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1967"><a name="pos1967"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Were you an office bearer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1968"><a name="pos1968"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I was an office bearer, I started to ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1969"><a name="pos1969"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You can't remember exactly which portfolio you had?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1970"><a name="pos1970"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I'm not sure which portfolio, but I was quite ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1971"><a name="pos1971"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And was Mr Williams an office bearer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1972"><a name="pos1972"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1973"><a name="pos1973"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Now I just want to clarify this.  You said that this was a regional executive within Cayco, what region was it of Cayco?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1974"><a name="pos1974"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> It was the ...(indistinct) of Cayco.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1975"><a name="pos1975"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1976"><a name="pos1976"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> It was the ...(indistinct) region of Cayco ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1977"><a name="pos1977"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry?  Athlone region of Cayco?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1978"><a name="pos1978"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Athlone region, but not all at the meeting, present at the meeting would have an office bearing function for that Athlone region.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1979"><a name="pos1979"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> But they were reps of the various branches within the Athlone region?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1980"><a name="pos1980"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1981"><a name="pos1981"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And around Cape Town there would have been a whole range of other sub-regions, all making up the Western Cape, for example?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1982"><a name="pos1982"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1983"><a name="pos1983"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Now did Mr Williams ever tell you, soon after that or at any time after that, that Gakkie said to him: "Listen man, you guys must get out of here, I put a bomb in this place"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1984"><a name="pos1984"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> At no point, that's ludicrous.  At no point, ja.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1985"><a name="pos1985"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> He didn't come to you say: "Jeez, Gakkie is out of his tree, he told us he put a bomb there"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1986"><a name="pos1986"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> No, Sir, he never said anything to that effect.  At no point did Peter come and tell me that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1987"><a name="pos1987"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Were you ever approached, up until the time you actually did make a statement, were you approached by the police to make a statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1988"><a name="pos1988"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> At no point, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1989"><a name="pos1989"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Thank you, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1990"><a name="pos1990"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Alexander, did you own a Valiant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1991"><a name="pos1991"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> I owned a Valiant.  It was my brother's Valiant, but that was in 1984/'85.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1992"><a name="pos1992"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Because Gakkie's testified that he didn't know that you drove an Isuzu bakkie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1993"><a name="pos1993"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That's not the facts, Sir.  The Valiant was last driven in '85 and by mid-'85 I bought an Audi.  I had an Audi 100.  I think it was a cream colour.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1994"><a name="pos1994"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And also we heard from the evidence of Gakkie, that he got some documents of the Kewtown Youth Movement which he handed over.  He can't read, but he said he could discern Kewtown, but he didn't know the content, what sort of documents do you think - accepting that, what sort of documents do you think he could have handed over?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1995"><a name="pos1995"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> It might pertain to informing people around the elections, but not threatening or of such a nature.  We weren't in the business of threats.  We tried to inform people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1996"><a name="pos1996"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What sort of pamphlets, because Mr Williams when questioning, also mentioned pamphlets, Kewtown pamphlets, what were the contents of those pamphlets, what would they have been?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1997"><a name="pos1997"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Explanations around the elections, what in fact you do by voting, you're legitimising the current government, but ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1998"><a name="pos1998"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So they were against the upcoming tricameral elections and just voicing that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1999"><a name="pos1999"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> That's right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2000"><a name="pos2000"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And then also just one last point, you heard the evidence of Mr Hardien, he said that there was a lot of violence, political violence at the time, tyres being burnt in the street, trucks, vehicles being burnt and he said that he saw a lot of this and every time he was at such a scene he saw members of Kewtown, and he was of the opinion that they must have been associated or involved with the commission of the deeds, the burning of the tyres and the trucks, what's your comment on that evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2001"><a name="pos2001"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> At no point did any members of Kewtown youth commit arson or did any acts of public violence, Sir.  If I may just add, Isgak was a paid guy to try and do those things.  We've heard evidence from Mr Barnard that that was the type of things that these guys were paid to do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2002"><a name="pos2002"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Just one last thing.  Were yourself or any other members of the Kewtown youth ever prosecuted for any such acts?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2003"><a name="pos2003"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALEXANDER:</span> Never, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2004"><a name="pos2004"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Any questions arising out of questions that have been put by Members of the Panel?  Does that then conclude the evidence in this matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2005"><a name="pos2005"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> That is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2006"><a name="pos2006"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2007"><a name="pos2007"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line2008"><a name="pos2008"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And I believe that arrangements have been made regarding the filing of Heads of Argument and hearing argument.  Would you like to put that on record, Mr Coleridge?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2009"><a name="pos2009"></a><span class="speaker">MR COLERIDGE:</span> Yes thank you, Chairperson.  We're going to hear argument, Chairperson, it's been set down for the 18th and the 19th of November.  Unfortunately it's a Saturday and a Sunday, Chairperson, but we couldn't get - we're all be available on those days Chairperson, everybody's diaries are pretty booked up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2010"><a name="pos2010"></a>	And then Chairperson, just for applicants to file by the 6th of November and objections by the 15th of November, Chairperson.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2011"><a name="pos2011"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Will it be in Cape Town?  A venue to be arranged and everyone will get due notification of that venue?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2012"><a name="pos2012"></a><span class="speaker">MR COLERIDGE:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.  At this point we have a strong feeling that it's going to be at the TRC offices, Chairperson, which could accommodate a few of us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2013"><a name="pos2013"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Mr Chairman firstly, may I express our gratitude to you and Members of the Committee, even though I understand that you were not specifically consulted on sitting during the weekend in order to primarily accommodate our own available, Mr Chairman, we are really most grateful for that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2014"><a name="pos2014"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you, Mr Bizos.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2015"><a name="pos2015"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> There is just one other matter, Mr Chairman.  I don't know that we can get any agreement before the adjournment, could we ask you Mr Chairman, from ...(indistinct) in consultation with Members of the Committee, to indicate where you intend marking where the vehicle was.  If anybody has got any objection, they can voice it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2016"><a name="pos2016"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> This is the vehicle at the time it was stationary and before it was reversed a little distance.  That one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2017"><a name="pos2017"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2018"><a name="pos2018"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It's almost - if one takes a look at P2, there seems to be, I don't know if it's a vehicle parked in that photograph.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2019"><a name="pos2019"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> There's a white rectangular object on the road, on the left of the road.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2020"><a name="pos2020"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Approximately there.  That's before it was reversed back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2021"><a name="pos2021"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes, we would agree with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2022"><a name="pos2022"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Martini, do you see that?  P2, that's the ...  It might have been slightly closer to the wall, but more-or-less there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2023"><a name="pos2023"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Chairperson, I just can't orientate myself to the inspection, I can't even ...  I can see the mark there, but I can't even recall ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line2024"><a name="pos2024"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Can you see in the car park there's a red rood or something, that wasn't there at the time, we were told that at the inspection in loco.  That is at the back of the building and you can see the circle of the road coming round forms a D-shape, can you see that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2025"><a name="pos2025"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2026"><a name="pos2026"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Now that is the circle within which Mr van Zyl indicated they'd parked the vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2027"><a name="pos2027"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> My only problem is I can't visualise that circle in that direction, I recall ...(indistinct - no microphone)</p>
<p class="line" id="line2028"><a name="pos2028"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The speaker's microphone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2029"><a name="pos2029"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> I recall we looked away from the Early Learning Centre, from the parking lot and I just can't place this circle.  I'm not trying to be ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line2030"><a name="pos2030"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It's a very big circle, it's not a roundabout circle, it's a big circle and there's a main road behind it.  You can see the main road there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2031"><a name="pos2031"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Can you see - just listen, can you see Abduramen Avenue, that mark there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2032"><a name="pos2032"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> ;   Mr Lax, sorry, you keep telling me "just listen", I'm saying I accept where that little mark is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2033"><a name="pos2033"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2034"><a name="pos2034"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Could we agree on the next letter of the alphabet that's got to go through.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2035"><a name="pos2035"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> G.  Make that G.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2036"><a name="pos2036"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> You see Chairperson, that's the point I complained of earlier, which Mr Lax wouldn't let me explain to the Chair.  We don't have a diagram, A, B, C, D, E, F, G on it.  Now you've marked G, but none of us know - well, I certainly don't know what A is, B, C, or D.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2037"><a name="pos2037"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That must be done and here's the original which is not the same as P2, but we can get them from here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2038"><a name="pos2038"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> We will give Mr Martini our copies.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2039"><a name="pos2039"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> May I suggest Chairperson, next time we come and argue, that we have a uniform one, the one that the Chair has, because Mr Kahanovitz says "copy mine", I assume it's the same as the Chair's.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2040"><a name="pos2040"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes but I think it's probably better to do it now before you prepare your arguments.  I think when we adjourn, Mr Martini, I'll give you these and you can do it from there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2041"><a name="pos2041"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Shall we copy it from the Chair's one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2042"><a name="pos2042"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2043"><a name="pos2043"></a><span class="speaker">MR MARTINI:</span> Thanks, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2044"><a name="pos2044"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes well thank you very much, that then concludes the evidence in this matter and as you heard, we'll next be meeting on the 18th of November at a venue still to be finalised, for argument, final argument after the presentation of written Heads.  But tomorrow we'll be proceeding with another matter at this venue.  What time will we be starting tomorrow, Ms Coleridge?  Half-past nine?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2045"><a name="pos2045"></a><span class="speaker">MS COLERIDGE:</span> If we could start at nine-thirty, Chairperson.</p>
