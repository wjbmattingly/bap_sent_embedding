<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR PAPIER:</span> Now I understand that the Bontheuwel Rent Office was identified as a target for a limpet mine attack, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR HENDRICKS:</span> That was correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR PAPIER:</span> Under whose overall command were you acting?</p>

<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR HENDRICKS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR PAPIER:</span> Now your affidavit before this Committee makes reference to, on page 53, paragraph 4, that"</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a>"On the 28th of September 1998"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a>I understand that's a typing error, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR HENDRICKS:</span> That is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR PAPIER:</span> What is the correct date?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR HENDRICKS:</span> The correct date is the 28th of September 1988.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR PAPIER:</span> Yes.  Now can you in fact tell this Commission or Committee what happened on the 28th of September 1988 in relation to the Bontheuwel Rent Office?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR HENDRICKS:</span> Okay.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a>"First we decided that the Bontheuwel Rent Office was going to be a target and then we had to do reconnaissance work ensuring that nobody should get hurt in the incident, whether it was safe to do it, whether there were people using the street at that time of the night and that was what we first had to establish and we established that it was quite safe.  Nobody used that alley and we said it was safe to carry out the operation.</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR PAPIER:</span> Yes.  Why was the Bontheuwel ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Over what period was the reconnaissance take place?  What period?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR HENDRICKS:</span> The period, we used three weeks to do reconnaissance on the Rent Office and that means by loitering at night, loitering around the area for the time and establishing who uses, if they use it and we have established that, that the street is not used at night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR PAPIER:</span> Why was the Bontheuwel Rent Office chosen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR HENDRICKS:</span> The Bontheuwel Rent Office was chosen because we have seen it as a means to carry out the political objectives of our unit and that was, we have seen that the Rent Office was an oppressive mechanism used by the State and that's why we have identified the Rent Office.  We also wanted to spark off a rent boycott and the local councillor was also using the Rent Office and that's why we decided on the Rent Office as a target.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR PAPIER:</span> I understand that you were also, or where were you living at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR HENDRICKS:</span> I was living in Bontheuwel.  I am still living in Bontheuwel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR PAPIER:</span> Yes.  So I understand that you then did the reconnaissance and on the night of the 28th of September, what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR HENDRICKS:</span> On the night of the 28th of September, myself, the late Colin Williams and Vanessa, we proceeded to the Rent Office and then we secured the area by seeing that it is quite safe and it is not used, we established that first, because if we found out that the area was being used then we would have cancelled the operation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR PAPIER:</span> Yes, so it was you ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What do you mean by used?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR HENDRICKS:</span> By used I mean, nobody walked in Bontheuwel, the streets are quite empty at night and by used I mean, there are only certain streets that are used, nobody uses the street by the Rent Office, because that street was quite dark and there's nothing happening in that vicinity.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR PAPIER:</span> Yes.  So I understand that it was your instruction to avoid any injury to any member of the public, or any person, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR HENDRICKS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR PAPIER:</span> Now were you in possession of any ammunition?</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR HENDRICKS:</span> Yes, I was in possession of a cache which I got the limpet mine from.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR PAPIER:</span> Yes and can you tell us what happened?  You proceeded to the Rent Office with Vanessa and with the late Colin Williams, armed with the limpet mine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR HENDRICKS:</span> Yes, after securing the area and seeing that it's safe, we proceeded to prime the limpet mine and we then placed it at the door of the Rent Office and then we respectively went to our homes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR PAPIER:</span> Yes.  Now who primed the limpet mine?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR HENDRICKS:</span> The limpet mine was primed by Colin Williams.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR PAPIER:</span> Yes and how was it placed at the door?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR HENDRICKS:</span> It was placed at the door on its side.  I think we used a milk carton and we placed it on its side.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR PAPIER:</span> You say you used a milk carton, it was an empty milk carton, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR HENDRICKS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR PAPIER:</span> And where was the limpet mine placed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR HENDRICKS:</span> At the front door of the Rent Office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR PAPIER:</span> Yes.  Was it placed in this milk carton?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR HENDRICKS:</span> In the milk carton, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR PAPIER:</span> I see.  What happened thereafter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR HENDRICKS:</span> After we primed the limpet mine, we then went to our separate homes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR PAPIER:</span> Yes.  I understand that you established thereafter that the limpet mine was detonated and Mr Bartlett, Mr Nurudien Bartlett was unfortunately injured, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR HENDRICKS:</span> Yes, that is correct and we deeply regret that Mr Bartlett was injured in this incident because it wasn't our intention for anybody to get hurt in the incident and it's only afterwards that we found out that he had gotten hurt in the incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR PAPIER:</span> Yes.  Now what was you overall objective?</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR HENDRICKS:</span> As I've said ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Hendricks can you just - this limpet mine that you talk about, can you describe it for us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR HENDRICKS:</span> The limpet mine that we used was a mini limpet mine, the colour was brown.  Yes, it's some time ago that we used the mini limpet mine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How would it be detonated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR HENDRICKS:</span> How would it be detonated?  First you have your ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, I'm talking about that one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR HENDRICKS:</span> The mini one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That particular bomb.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR HENDRICKS:</span> I'll explain.  First you have your detonator and then you have your fuse and then you put in a plate, that would be your timing device and you slip in your plate and then you screw a detonator in, we usually for safety measures, we would pull the detonator to see that there's nothing faulty with the device, with the detonator and then we would screw in our fuse and then at the scene at the last minute then we place the detonator in the mini limpet mine, that is how we would go about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And how long was the, what size timing device, or what colour timing device was inserted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR HENDRICKS:</span> I think that we have used the timing device that it should have gone off quite late.  I think we used the thickest plate, I think that was the red one, but I'm not quite sure, but I think that device had to be detonated some early time the next morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR PAPIER:</span> In the early hours of the morning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR HENDRICKS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR PAPIER:</span> Thank you Judge.  Now, what was your overall objective in executing this operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR HENDRICKS:</span> As I have said, our objective was politically motivated, it was to further, to carry out the objectives of the ANC Military wing, MK, it was to spark off a rent boycott and we have seen the Rent Office as an oppressive structure in our area and we felt that it had to be destroyed and it was also to make our areas more ungovernable and to bring the struggle closer to the people because we had lost a lot of comrades in the Bontheuwel area that were detained and we wanted to stay there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR PAPIER:</span> Yes.  Now you subsequently established that Mr Bartlett was injured.  Have you been to visit the family at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR HENDRICKS:</span> Yes, we have been to visit the family.  We have spoken to them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR PAPIER:</span> When was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR HENDRICKS:</span> That was about two years ago.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR PAPIER:</span> 1997?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR HENDRICKS:</span> 1997 yes.  We spoke to them and we told them that it was us that placed the limpet mine at the Rent Office and that we deeply regret that Mr Bartlett was injured in the incident and we have come to ask their forgiveness and they said that they are going to forgive us and we have made our peace with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR PAPIER:</span> Yes.  Do you know how Mr Bartlett got injured?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR HENDRICKS:</span> From newspaper reports and what I've heard from on the radio.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR PAPIER:</span> Yes.  And it is on record that Mr Bartlett apparently picked the carton up and threw it away and  then it was detonated, is that your understanding of the position as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR PAPIER:</span> I think so, but I can't say for sure how he got injured, but I think that he must have tampered with the device or something.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR PAPIER:</span> Yes.  Thank you Judge, thank you Commissioners I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR PAPIER</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you, before I interrupted you, you had asked a question which required the applicant to stand and display something.  Am I correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR PAPIER:</span> No, Judge, I think he misunderstood me.  I was in the process of, it wasn't my request to get him to demonstrate something.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Hendricks, I want you to explain something.  Were you trained in the use of explosives?</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR HENDRICKS:</span> I was trained in the use of explosives.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> To what extent?</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR HENDRICKS:</span> I was trained, the military engineering, that was how to activate a limpet mine, I was trained how to defuse it again.  I was trained in the inside mechanisms of the device, how it worked.  That we call military engineering.  I was trained in firearms.  I was trained politically.  I was trained.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In your training, did you come across a device which was planted, for example, in the sand and would only explode by detonation at the release of a plunger of some sort?</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR HENDRICKS:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You don't know what you call that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR HENDRICKS:</span> That would be called something that you set, a mine that you set off by stepping on it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You don't know or you can't remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR HENDRICKS:</span> I can't remember.  But I wasn't trained in ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now who was the person that trained you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR HENDRICKS:</span> I was trained by the late Anton Frans and Melvin Bruintjies.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And in respect of the explosives that you explained today, you know what they taught you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR HENDRICKS:</span> Yes.  I also ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR HENDRICKS:</span> I also had a training kit, like I had a whole survival pack, a training kit, AK, a Makarov and hand grenades which were in my possession.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...survival kit to mean.  Anything else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR PAPIER:</span> I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Thank you Honourable Chairperson, I'll be brief.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS PATEL:</span> You say that "We took the decision to identify the target".  Who specifically is we?</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR HENDRICKS:</span> We would be the unit, that's me, Colin and Vanessa and then we had to report it to Aneez Salie, who had to give the overall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> And was this done prior to the operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR HENDRICKS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Can I just ask you if, you say the limpet mine was placed in a milk carton.  If somebody picked it up, would it detonate, or would it have to fall, or how?  Can you just give us more detail on what would cause it to go off?</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR HENDRICKS:</span> Like I said, if somebody tampered with it, it could go off.  If somebody dropped it, it could also go off.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MS PATEL:</span> Alright.  Here Mr Bartlett says he picked the carton up and dropped it and as a result of that it exploded.  Thank you Honourable Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS PATEL</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR PAPIER:</span> Thank you, Judge, I have no further questions.  No re-examination.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a>NO RE-EXAMINATION BY MR PAPIER</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Hendricks was that your first experience at setting up a device like that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR PAPIER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How many times before have you done so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR HENDRICKS:</span> I can't remember, but I've been actively, from 87 I've been actively, I can't say how many operations I carried out before, but I've been actively, for the whole period I've been actively involved in carrying out operations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I want to ask you something.  I don't know to what extent the answer will affect the decision.  When you planted, or when the three of you planted this device in a carton and left it there at the front door, surely you must have realised a child or someone could come pick it up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR HENDRICKS:</span> Your Honour, as I've said that we had made sure that nobody used that area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And if, well it is hardly likely in terms of your reconnaissance, someone did come pick it up.  Do you follow what I'm saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR HENDRICKS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Let me lead on to where I'm getting to.  Why didn't you think it necessary then to put it somewhere you could do as much damage as you wanted to to the building without risking somebody picking it up?  Stick it somewhere else, not at the front door, where it's easily accessible to the public.  Did it not cross your mind?</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR HENDRICKS:</span> We wanted to do maximum damage to the building.  If we had suspected that anybody could have gotten injured, I know what you're saying, that anybody could have gotten injured, we would have aborted the mission, if we had seen that that night there were too many people around in the area, then we would have aborted the mission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I understand that you did everything necessary to minimise the risk.  All I'm asking is, why wasn't the bomb placed somewhere else, which would have given you the same results?</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR HENDRICKS:</span> The unit had decided that the front door was ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The place to put it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR HENDRICKS:</span> The place to put it to have a greater damage on the building.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And when did you find out that somebody was in fact injured?</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR HENDRICKS:</span> I can't remember.  I think it was via the radio or early the next morning, or that same night I think which we then reported.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes. Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR PAPIER:</span> Thank you Judge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We are going to break for lunch now.  We'll adjourn till 2 o'clock.</p>
