            "Thank you, Mr Chairman.  Mr Chairman, I will refer to my Heads of Argument in some detail, but I won't dwell on the matters that I've addressed therein.  Mr Chairman, the Preamble of the Act makes it clear that one of the aims in the passing of this Act, is to create the unique machinery whereby those who in the past had in certain circumstances made themselves guilty of violations, can be granted amnesty for their deeds.  It's clear here that we're dealing with a unique process which is not unknown in the world.  And let me emphasise that reference and should properly be made to perhaps decisions in criminal matters and other civil matters, but there shouldn't be a slavish following of the principles that have been decided upon in criminal matters necessarily in the past.  One has to always have regard to the fact that we're dealing here with a unique process which is different in many respects, from that which prevails in the criminal court and that the provisions of this Act should be widely interpreted and more benevolently than which the Criminal Procedure Act in the criminal law should be applied.\n\tMr Chairman, I state in paragraph 2 that no procedure for the hearing is described in the Act, but it is clear that we are dealing with an administrative process which is subject to the principles of administrative law.  I may refer to the case of Du Preez vs The Truth and Reconciliation Commission, where the principles had been set out, that's well known, and one of the important principles of administrative law and the fairness principle in that is that when there is an accusation against a person, that person should be given an opportunity to deal with that accusation, he should have proper notice of that and then he must be given an opportunity to deal with that.  Now in due course I will submit that insofar as my client is concerned there were no, although it may be argued that he did not make a full disclosure, it was not suggested to him in any respect that there were facts and what the facts were that he failed to disclose.  The attack on him was a general credibility attack as to what had happened before the Harms Commission some 10 years ago and the attack was not pertinent to any particular fact that he had not disclosed insofar as these particular deeds are concerned for which he applied amnesty for.\n\tMr Chairman, I state in paragraph 3 that the Committee in these applications has the unusually difficult task of deciding the applications in an unbiased fair way, while the issues, personalities and atmosphere of the hearing are deeply emersed in the emotion and previously acquired profiles negatively reflect on the character of the applicant.  Mr Chairman, we can just have regard to what had appeared in the press in the last 10 years, the accusations that have been levelled against the applicants, the suspicions that prevailed and in particular, where the press over the last 10 years and especially in 1990, everything that had gone wrong had been placed at the doors of the CCB.  Now we all know, and you know better than any of us, I presume, that all these deeds that were placed, most of the deeds that had been placed at the door of the CCB in those years, actually were committed by the Police and the Security Forces in particular.  And as a result of the bad press that the CCB had received in the early years, a perception had been created that everything that was done was done by the CCB and Verster, in particular, which in fact is not true.  So Mr Chairman, it is my submission that the Committee has the invidious task of disassociating itself from the urge to approach the application against the background of prejudice and popular public perception and preconceived impressions.\n\tMr Chairman, although at first glance appearing an insurmountable task Mr Chairman, as you are only human with certain backgrounds and certain perspectives, it becomes easier if one has regard to the clear and unambiguous words of Section 20 of the Act, which states how amnesty should be granted and the effect thereof.  And Mr Chairman, I would like to read it although you probably know this better than anyone else, but it is of importance that one should always bear the words of the legislature foremost in one's mind.  It states:\n\"If the Committee, after considering an application for amnesty, is satisfied the application complies with the requirements of this Act.  The act, omission or offence to which the application relates is an act associated with a political objective committed in the course of the conflict of the past, in accordance with the provisions of (2) and (3) and (c), the applicant has made a full disclosure of all relevant facts, it shall grant amnesty in respect of that act, omission or offence.\"\nMr Chairman, it is suggested that if you steer clear of speculation and conjecture, then a grant of amnesty will follow as a matter of course.\n\tInsofar as the word \"political objective\", in terms of Section 20(1)(b) is concerned, a benevolent interpretation should be adopted.  The clear intention of the legislature was for reconciliation and reconstruction of society.  Statutes like this should always be liberally interpreted.  I refer to some authority.  It was also of importance to note that this particular Act had been promulgated against a background and the spirit of the Preamble, which reads as follows:\n\"And since the Constitution states that there was a need for understanding but not for vengeance, a need for reparation but not for retaliation, a need for ubuntu but not victimisation.\"\n\tIt is therefore submitted that regard has to be taken of the Preamble of the Act and the intention of the legislature and the Constitution, and that it's clear that a narrow and restricted interpretation and application of the criteria mentioned in the Act, could not have been the purpose and intention of the legislature.  A narrow and restricted interpretation would invariably lead to the creating of a dangerous situation and that it would certainly discourage people which it sought to bring forward to apply voluntarily for amnesty and to disclose the deeds that were perpetrated in the past, in the fear that the conditions would be applied so harshly, strictly and narrowly that the granting of amnesty would only be done in the most exceptional cases.  ...(indistinct) past decisions of the Amnesty Committee show that a wide and benevolent interpretation has been adopted.  \n\tNow Mr Chairman, you sit as a Committee of the Amnesty Committee and it is my submission that in regard to decisions that have been made in the past where amnesty was granted, although of course the facts differ and there is no precedent, principle that applies, you are nevertheless bound to apply the general principles that have been applied in the past and if a benevolent interpretation has been adopted, then you should be bound by applying the same type of principle in these cases.\n\tThere have been many applications granted in the past, and unfortunately I'm not in possession of those decisions, I can only speak from what has been reported in the popular press, but in regard to many of those cases where amnesty has in fact been granted on both sides of the spectrum, it is clear that the Commission have applied a benevolent interpretation, especially insofar as the proportionality principle has been concerned, and it is my submission that if you look from the one end of the scale, matters like Macgoo's Bar Bombing and on the other hand even matters like Nietverdiend killings, those are matters which were far more serious than any of the matters which are before you, and amnesty was nevertheless granted in those particular cases.",

            "Yes.  The act, omission or offence to which the applicant relates, is associated with a political objective and was committed in the course of the conflict of the past, in accordance with the provisions of (2) and (3) and that the applicant has made a full disclosure of all the relevant facts.\n\tMr Chairman, for purposes of determining if an act is associated with a political objective, the criterion in Section 20(2) shall be taken into account and to determine whether an act is associated with a political objective, the factors as set out in Section 20(3), should be taken into account.\n\tThen I'm just referred to Section 20(4), I won't dwell on that.  The other formalities or principles that are required I set out in 14, Mr Chairman.  It's not necessarily to deal with that I believe.\n\tMr Chairman, what is important is that Section 20(2)(b) makes it clear that amnesty can be granted to members of a Security Force, who committed acts during a political struggle against members or supporters of an organisation opposed to the State, in the bona fide belief that they were countering and resisting the struggle.\n\tSimilarly, Section 20(2)(f) indemnifies any person who, on reasonable grounds, believed that he was acting within the course and scope of his duties and within the course and scope of his or her expressed or implied authority.\n\tThen Mr Chairman, insofar as Section 20(1)(c) is concerned, one must read the words \"full disclosure of all relevant facts\" in the context of the Section as a whole.  The application for amnesty is for a particular act, omission or offence, and I refer to Section 20(1)(b) and that act, omission or offence, Section 20(1).  It is therefore clear, in my submission, that the legislature intended to deal only with particular acts and not anything more.  \n\tThis Committee is an Amnesty Committee under Section 16 and 17 of the Act, and not an Investigative Committee under Section 12.  \n\tInsofar as evidence was elicited which do not pertain to the three applications of the applicant, it is my submission that it is irrelevant for the purposes of the application, whether given by the applicant or anyone else.  Section 20(1)(c) makes it clear that we are not dealing with all facts, but only relevant facts.\n\tThe next question that arises is what is meant by \"the Committee, after considering an application for amnesty, is satisfied that\".  Mr Chairman, in the Afrikaans version of the Act \"oortuig\" is used, \"satisfied\" is not the same as \"oortuig\".  I refer to the case of S vs Makula and would like to quote from that case:\n\"The official version of Act 51/77, namely the Afrikaans text, uses the word 'oortuig' in the said Section, whereas the English text used the word 'satisfied'.  In my view, the correct translation of the words 'om te oortuig' is not to satisfy but to convince.  It is only if a person is convinced of a certain fact that one can say in Afrikaans 'hy is daarvan oortuig'.  The correct rendering into Afrikaans of the words 'to satisfy' in the present context, is not 'om te oortuig', but 'om tevrede te stel'.  According to the English/Afrikaans Grootwoordeboek, the word 'satisfied' is translated as 'tevrede, versadig, bevredig, voldoen' and the word 'satisfy' is 'bevredig, voldoen, tevrede stel, versadig, gerusstel.\"",

It is clear that we don't have the position where an accused or an applicant must come and prove anything on any probabilities.  If that had been the intention it would have been easy for the legislature to state that the applicant must prove on a balance of probabilities, or whatever the position was, that he was telling the truth or as is said in the Criminal Procedure Act, before indemnity can be granted in terms of Section 204, there was must be an honest and frank disclosure, then he can get it.\n\tOne must assume that the legislature was aware of the provisions in the Criminal Procedure Act, where indemnity can be granted to a person if he makes frank and honest disclosure, and the legislature didn't use those words in this particular Act.  And one must then look at the Act as a whole to see what was the intention of the legislature, was there an onus that is being placed on a particular applicant in a civil sense, where on the probabilities he has to prove things, or does he merely have to satisfy a reasonable Tribunal, that the facts that he's disclosed were full in the sense that people would know what had been done in the past.  He doesn't even have to be a good or an honest witness. He, in my submission, can be a bad witness in the sense that he hasn't make frank disclosure or honest disclosure about many facts in his application, which in terms of the Criminal Procedure Act, would not entitle him to an indemnity in a court, but as long as he makes full disclosure of the facts pertaining to the particular application.",

If the test was that he has to be an honest witness who made a frank disclosure, as the test is in the Criminal Procedure Act, then once it is found that he doesn't comply with that test, then he shouldn't get amnesty for anything, because he's not a frank and honest witness.  Whilst, if the test is applied as I submit it should be applied, that he must make full disclosure of a particular act, then you can grant him amnesty for the acts where he's made full disclosure and refuse him on those that he hasn't made full disclosure.  And I think one must look at the Act and if you test it in this fashion, then you'll see that that is what the legislature had in mind.  Mr Chairman, I deal further in the paragraph with the argument that we've just deal with, I won't read further my Heads.\n\tParagraph 22, I deal with the Criminal Procedure Act and the words \"frankness\" and \"honesty\" that are used there.\n\tThen I submit that the applicant qualifies for amnesty under Section 20(2)(b), alternatively, Section 20(2)(f).  Now Section 20(2)(b) reads as follows, Mr Chairman:\n\"Any employee of the State or any former State or any members of the Security Forces of the State, or any former State in the course and scope of his or her duties and within the scope of his or her express or implied authority, directed against a publicly known political organisation or liberation movement engaged in the political struggle against the State or a former State or against members or supporters of such organisation or movement and which is committed bona fide with the object of countering or otherwise resisting the said struggle\"\nand then (f)\n\"Any person referred to in paragraph (b), (c) and (d), who on reasonable grounds, believed that he or she was acting in the course and scope of his or her duties and within the scope of his or her express or implied authority, qualify.\"\n\tNow this becomes relevant in regard to the dispute between Verster and Webb on the Omar and Evans incidents.

If Webb did not give him permission, then you must test whether he bona fide believed that he had authority, express or implied, in terms of Section 20(2)(f).  \n\tNow let's look at the facts, Mr Chairman.  It is submitted that insofar as Verster is concerned there's no dispute that he gave the authority for the elimination believing on reasonable grounds that he was acting in the course and scope of his duties and within the scope of his express authority.  The Committee is referred to the testimony which on this ground, was not attacked, save by Gen Webb.  No-one else suggested to Verster that he did not have authority from Webb, with reference to the logistical support, ie: the money and the firearm was made available.

There can be no question that the applicant on reasonable grounds, believe that he was acting in the course and scope of his duties and within the scope of his express or implied authority and therefore complies with Section 20(2)(f).",

I will just refer briefly to the proportionality principle that has been dealt with on page 17 and further of my Heads, and make the submission Mr Chairman, that this is a very relative concept and the way that it's been applied in these cases, show that there is not really a true weighing of the act committed, on the one hand, towards the end result or the success to be achieved by that.  It is impossible to do it really.\n\tIt is my submission that the proportionality principle would only find practical application in extreme cases, where you may have a case that in a war situation although the attempt is made to fight the enemy, there are means used which are so far removed from the possible success to be achieved that you can't say that it falls within the parameters of the Act.  And one can perhaps think of examples where the Forces of one country tries to subject the Forces of another country in any possible way.  It would be legitimate for the parties to shoot each other, in war theory, on the one hand.  But now how far does it go?  Would it be permissable for the one party's Forces, the enemy's Forces to burn down the houses of the opposing Forces soldiers and take their wives and children, put them in concentration camps, because it may have an effect on the outcome of the war situation?  Does it go further, if that is legitimate, would it be further to rape all the women that stay behind, because that will weaken the moral resolve of the enemy Forces.  And one can go to very bizarre examples and it's very difficult to apply that.",

I don't know if you understand what I'm saying.\n\tIn other words, if one takes a look, just take the case of conspiracy to murder, you've got a conspiracy right, that's an offence, you can go to jail for that, but it's never carried out, so there's not actual result to the conspiracy other than itself being in the minds of people or maybe they might have taken certain acts, whatever, but as far as the victim is concerned there's no result, the victim is unharmed.  Can proportionality ever apply in that?  \n\tCan you say well look, conspiracy, the reason given, the motive to conspire to kill the person, was not justified at all.  You want to kill a person who is an ordinary civilian and there was no justification, on a political basis or any other basis, at all, to kill him.

I deal with that aspect on paragraph 34 of my Heads, Mr Chairman.\n\tThen Mr Chairman, there's been many suggestions during the course of these lengthy proceedings, from counsel to the witnesses, which is my submission never went beyond speculation.  And if there is to be a finding that there wasn't full disclosure, it can only be made on inferences that is to be drawn.  And the submission will be that there wasn't a full disclosure of the bomb aspect.  There was no suggestion, as far as I can make out, that there wasn't a full disclosure pertaining to the facts as they related to the Omar and Evans conspiracy to murder itself, the only suggestion is that insofar as the bomb is concerned there wasn't full disclosure on the facts, because there was an attempt in fact, to kill the people and not only to damage the building. \n\tNow to come to that conclusion you would have to make inferences from the facts that are proved, or let me not use approved in that sense, but the facts that you find pertain to the incidents.  And then Mr Chairman, it is my submission that you have to, at the very least, apply the test as set out in R vs Blom, and that test is the following:\n(1)\t\"That the inference sought to be drawn must be consistent with all the proved facts.  If it is not, then the inference cannot be drawn.\n\t(2)\tThe proved facts should be such that they exclude every reasonable inference from them, save the one to be drawn.  If they do not exclude other reasonable inferences, then there must be doubt whether the inference sought to be drawn is correct.\"\n\tMr Chairman, that is a cardinal rule of logic and in applying the test to proven facts here, in contradistinction to speculation, the applicant's version that the intention was only to damage that building, it is my submission, cannot be refuted. \n\tIt is my submission that although there were persons in the building at the time of the bomb went off, it is clear that there's room for a mistake, even perhaps negligence on the part of Van Zyl, Botha and Hardien.  It is clear from that evidence, it was put to the witness, Mr Alexander, the statement of Mr Williams that he had made at the time.  It was put to Mr Alexander, the evidence of the soccer players.  It was clear from his evidence that the Kewtown Youth Movement had actually left the building, that it is possible that someone could have thought that those people had left after the meeting had been adjourned, and that nobody in the position of Van Zyl, Botha or Hardien, would have known that the other people were coming to have a meeting, because they had got together across the street at the hall and only there decided that they would go and have the meeting at that particular time, at the hall. \n\tSo the effect of that is that the Committee driven to a conclusion that the applicant, insofar as he is concerned, has made full disclosure of the relevant facts.  \n\tMr Chairman, that concludes my submissions and ...  Yes, and as my instructing attorney says, Mr Chairman, he's come here, he's made disclosure of these facts, why would he not make full disclosure?  He made full disclosure in regard to worse incidents, for instance the Nietverdiend incident, the Ribeiro incident, where he was peripherally involved only, but those are serious matters and amnesty was granted there to all the applicants in those particular cases.

There shouldn't be, to touch on the test of satisfied, there shouldn't be a heavy burden placed on them.

And I also say proportionality does become irrelevant, as raised in my Heads, because I say in these facts one has to look at what happened, was the result a grave result?  In most instances I'd say it was not, save possibly for the Early Learning Centre, it's a bomb, it destroyed the building, but still there weren't deaths, the results were not tragic.  And it's my submission that proportionality has no relevance.\n\tBut insofar as the Committee may believe there's relevance, Chairperson, one has to look at the situation which prevailed.  The situation, it is submitted in my Heads, was a situation of war, it wasn't a simple political disturbance or uprising.  People were being burnt alive in this country, bombs were going off, innocent civilians were being killed, from actions carried out by the liberation movements.  It's tragic but it happened.  That's our history and it's regrettable that it happened.\n\tTo revert back to the question of full disclosure, Chairperson, I associate myself with Mr Wessels, but at the same time it's quite clear from the wording of the Act, that there must be a full disclosure of relevant facts relating to the act for which application is made for amnesty.  Now on the clear reading of Section 20, it says:\n\"The Committee, after having considering an application for amnesty, is satisfied that the application complies with the requirements of this Act.  The act, omission or offence to which the application relates, is an act associated with a political objective committed in the course of the conflict of the past, in accordance with the provisions of (2) and (3) and (c), the applicant has made a full disclosure of all relevant facts\"\nand it goes further, which my learned colleague did not elaborate on:\n\"it shall grant amnesty in respect of that act, omission or offence\"\nso it refers back to (b).  So it's quite clear that there must be a full disclosure of the relevant facts, but that must also be of the relevant facts pertaining to the act for which an applicant applies for amnesty.",

So he can't have his cake and eat it.  He can only apply and get amnesty, full amnesty, for the acts for which he applies.

If the Committee finds well I believe there was evidence you ... and you don't grant amnesty, Chairperson, then possibly if the Attorney-General decides to prosecute, there's a prosecution.

After all, it was not a conventional war.  The Truth and Reconciliation Commission itself found that the war came into South Africa.  And in such circumstances as in Rafollo's case, which I quote in my Heads, in a war situation which prevailed in South Africa, which was an abnormal situation, maybe it is justified to kill a political opponent, but one would never, generally, in a civilised society justify the killing of a political opponent if there was no general war prevailing,  or circumstances prevailing at the time.\n\tThat's why in my Heads, Members of the Committee, I say the Committee must attempt to judge the applicants in this case, Mr van Zyl, for the deeds and try and judge them at the time that prevailed 12 years ago, not today in a democratic society where we can reflect and say well, the deed was terrible, to think of killing somebody was a terrible thing.  One's got to attempt to place itself in the applicant's position at the time.  And at the same time my submission is, even if proportionality does become relevant, which is not a requirement, the deeds of the applicant, the acts were proportional to the overall objective that the CCB attempted to achieve.

And another issue that motivated him was, if Chairperson will recall, was he didn't want to move to Pietermaritzburg, because of the dispute he had had, just in summary, I think with the Attorney-General.  He wouldn't testify specifically what the Attorney-General, something to that effect, wanted him to testify.\n\tAnd what's also important Chairperson, is if you'll recall he was questioned, it's not disputed, when he joined he did not know the intricate workings of the CCB.  If you will recall they went on a course and only then did they start finding out what the CCB's work really entailed.  My submission is clearly that his acts were not motivated by personal gain or malice.  Were his acts authorised?  Was he acting in the course and scope of his duties or within the course and scope of his implied or express authority?  My submission is that it was.  And once again also one can have reference to Section 20(f).  He believed that he was acting, he on reasonable grounds would have believed that he was acting in the course and scope of his authority.  \n\tIf the Committee recalls this, the nature in which this clandestine and secretive organisation worked, you had the General, the Managing Director, the Coordinator and the Regional Manager, Mr Burger, and what I'd term the footsoldiers, Mr Botha, Mr Maree and Mr van Zyl, in Region 6.  They received, Mr van Zyl received his instruction from Mr Burger or Basson, who in turn had received the instruction from Mr Verster, who in turn all must have believed that he had met with the General to authorise the projects referred to in the application.  Because the footsoldiers did not meet with the General and Mr Verster when a decision was taken to go ahead with the project.  \n\tWhen I questioned Gen Webb, Chairperson will recall that he conceded.  I said: \"Notwithstanding the dispute between yourself and Mr Verster, as to whether you authorised Omar or other disputed projects (I said), would the footsoldiers of Mr van Zyl have believed that they were authorised to carry out the act?\"  And he had to concede it because of the nature of the way the structure worked.  \n\tThey didn't know whether Verster and Webb met, so once Mr van Zyl got the order from either Mr Basson or Mr Burger, he believed reasonably, could only reasonably have believed that he had the authority to go ahead.  Because if you remember further in re-examination we tried to clarify the issues and it does touch on issues raised by - can we call them the Respondents, Chairperson, no disrespect, it's just a shorter word, was suggesting that Mr van Zyl took the decision to eliminate, say Minister Omar, to bomb the Early Learning Centre.  If you'll recall in the re-examination where we attempted to clear up, there was some doubt by the Committee how exactly it worked.  \n\tThe decision did not come from Van Zyl.  Van Zyl receives an instruction to do a pre-study for the purposes of, in the case of Mr Omar, elimination.  He does the study in-house and it goes further up.  And if you'll recall Mr van Zyl's evidence, the decision then actually to carry out that elimination is still not final yet until it comes back and they say go ahead and eliminate.

Well then I must go back now to political objective again.  I thought it is clear.  The political objective was clearly, Mr van Zyl repeated, protection of the sovereignty of the State, destruction of the enemy of the State.  The enemy of the State being the ANC and its affiliates.  But now we're touching back onto issues which are criteria which the Committee must consider, not requirements, as to whether the act was political.  \n\tNow it's my submission and it's dealt with in my Heads, the act was most definitely political.  He tells you: \"I was acting on instructions.  I was a supporter of the National Party Government.  I wanted to protect the sovereignty of the State.  In South Africa, we have the evidence of Mr Webb, the TRC's Findings, there was a war and this was part of the strategy of the South African Government, to resist or counter the armed struggle that was being waged by the liberation movements, in the people's war within.  It was to counter and resist that struggle.  The CCB would appear to have been an additional creature created by the government of the day to resist the armed struggle that was taking place.  We were in a State of Emergency where certain deeds were committed.  \n\tBut to answer your question, Mr Lax, that would go to whether it's a political objective.  But the relevant facts, it's my submission, these hearings are peculiar because fortunately I would say, there was no - that's Chairperson, the indicia also say look at the gravity of the act.  There was no serious tragic result.  Now had there been it would have been imperative, it would be relevant to tell Mrs Omar who killed your husband.  Or, first leg, your husband was killed by the CCB Region 6.  The victim wants the truth, they want to know what happened.  And Mrs Omar, Mr X killed your husband.  \n\tBut I'm going to move back now to the discrepancy with Barnard.

Now one's got to take a look at that.  Then we've got two conflicting versions between - relating to questions of fact, relating to certain details, particularly in the Omar incident.

His first statement in Section 29, which I don't place much weight on, because I appreciate those statements are under duress and there's a purpose in making those statements.

Judge Els accepted Mr van Zyl's evidence.  A Judge in a trial has accepted Mr van Zyl's evidence.  What did His Lordship Judge Els find?   He found Mr van Zyl's evidence acceptable.  And what did he find about Barnard?  He says Barnard himself conceded that he was part of a conspiracy to murder.  That related to the monitoring, because the Judge asked him: \"But did you know the plot involved killing him?\"  He said: \"Yes\".  So let's stop there.\n\tThe Judge further finds in that case that in all probability what Barnard tried to do, and it's my submission, but I won't elaborate on this, is what he did in Webster.  He thought himself he wanted to kill Mr Omar, to enhance himself in the eyes of the CCB.  That's what Judge Els found.  \n\tNow with the weapon his evidence and he himself realises that his evidence cannot be accepted Chairperson, what does he say in summary?  He says: \"I went down to Cape Town approximately three times\".  On the first occasion he says: \"I knew from then on I had to murder\", that's when the issue of the handing over the gun was dealt with.  But then he says he complains to Mr van Zyl, he says: \"Look, this is not going to work, I'm sticking out here like a sore thumb, rather find me an opportunity where Mr Omar is speaking, it's going to be easier\".  This can't be done, but yet he wants us to believe that on the third occasion he comes back, they've already assessed the situation and said it can't be done, to say he then went there to shoot Minister Omar, but he didn't do so because he came out of the house accompanied by a lady.  Now let's stop with that statement.  \n\tWe've heard Mr Barnard, Mr Barnard beats people's brains up and he sits here and he says their brain explodes.

            "Thank you, Mr Chairman.  If I can jump in at this stage.  Regarding Calla Botha, also I share the same view, in that I'm not going to repeat the requirements of the Act, it is before this Committee, and I am the first one to confess that this Committee knows much more about it than I profess to do so I'm not going to repeat it for the Committee.  As well as the position of the law.  That was also argued already before you and I'm not going to repeat it.\n\tRegarding the Heads of Argument, I also submitted Heads and I'm not going to read it out, it's brief, and the point I made in there I think is quite clear.  Regarding Botha, when he was giving evidence the translation that came through described him as a qualified demolitions expert, now that is not right, he was an explosives expert, and I submit that there's a big difference between a demolitions expert and an explosives expert, Mr Chairman, and that is not due to the fault of Mr Botha.  It maybe created the impression that he was there to demolish a building and that's surely not the position.\n\tMr Chairman, if we look at the arguments relating to Botha, from the Heads we've been served with, Botha was placed on ice.  Botha was basically in his own words, not informed of what happened there at the CCB, especially the relationship between him and Burger was not as it was between Burger and the other people working there.  \n\tAnd when Van Zyl encountered problems relating to the bombing of the Early Learning Centre, Van Zyl urged on Burger that he wanted Botha to help him in that.  On that basis Botha came back.  On that basis Botha was then informed by them.  \tAnd I submit at this stage, when he arrived there at the hotel he was encountered by Basson, Burger and Van Zyl, and he had not reason to query the decisions already made, the in-house, the plans, everything.  He was requested at that stage to carry the bomb and as an explosives expert, to arm the bomb at the Early Learning Centre.  He had nothing to do with the preplanning.  He had nothing to do with the political motivations regarding that.  And I submit with respect, Mr Chairman, that if we look at Botha's evidence relating to that incident, that he told this Honourable Committee exactly what he was informed and he had no need to query of those decisions there.\n\tIf we look at page 2 of part A of the bundle from Mr Bizos and Mr Kahanovitz, the criticism levelled against the people in the Early Learning Centre, from paragraph 4:\n\"The evidence of the applicant is to the effect that a bombing was intended merely to frighten the members KTY\"\nIt's false.  Botha had nothing to do with the preplanning of this, this was Van Zyl's part.  Van Zyl had to do it and Botha had to rely on what Van Zyl said.  You must also have regard to the evidence of Gakkie Hardien, how he described Botha as:\n\"that fat person.  Met him for the first time\"\nThere was no contact between them.\n\tIf we go further and we look at page 3, from paragraph 5 on part A from the Heads, I submit that if we look at that, the bulk of that criticism can't be levelled against Botha.  Botha was not involved in the gathering of the information.  Botha was not involved in the planning of this and Botha was most definitely not involved, in paragraph 8, the payment of Hardien.  He had nothing to do with the initial R30 000 and the eventual R18 000 that was paid.  So if we look at that, then I submit that we must look at the evidence of Botha and the role he played there in context, as it happened there that day.  That he was called in from the cold and asked to do a certain job in relation to the CCB, been instructed to that by Burger, Basson and his colleague at that stage, Van Zyl.",

And if my memory serves me right and if one has regard to his evidence, if the intention was to kill someone and that was planned in the in-house by Van Zyl, Burger and Basson and approved by the other senior members, he would have associated himself with that, but at that stage when the bomb was planned and put in the Early Learning Centre, that was not part, as far as he's concerned, of the operation there.\n\tAnother form of criticism against him is the discrepancies and the contradictions in his Section 29 statement.  He was cross-examined extensively on that.  I submit that he explained the position and the circumstances where he was detained under Section 29, and he had, at that stage, also regard and sympathy with Barnard who was his good friend and he tried to protect him as well. \n\tBotha excluded some other acts for which he didn't apply for amnesty but which he informed this Commission in full, regarding the Rosskam incident, regarding the Webster incident.  In ...(end of tape) ... and that is what he did there.  And I submit that that can't be held against him for not applying for amnesty for that and that when his amnesty application was compiled it was done by experienced legal practitioners and it can't be his fault that certain incidents were excluded.  Like for instance, the Rosskam one, it's not on his doorstep that it wasn't done.\n\tMr Chairman, I submit that if one looks at the requirements of the Act and what Botha's role was that he played in the bombing of the Early Learning Centre, that he explained fully his role, that he made a clean breast of it and that he is indeed sorry for what he did and that he apologised for that.  Surely one cannot expect from him to disclose more than what he knew.  For instance, people in the hall, the preplanning of it and if one looks at it in the totality of what transpired that evening there and thereafter, I submit that the only act for which he applied for amnesty, the bombing of the Early Learning Centre, he ought to get amnesty for that.\n\tThe other incidents for which he didn't apply, he made a clean breast of that here.  Obviously that doesn't come into the roll here and I submit in the end that Botha has done everything he could to fulfil the requirements of this Commission and the Act.  As it pleases.

            "Mr Commissioner and esteemed Members of the Committee, in dealing with the application of Mr Barnard for amnesty regarding the Apie project and the Omar project, one thing, with great respect, which is very clear is that the applicant doesn't at all try to disassociate himself from the seriousness or the immorality of the acts which he has perpetrated.  And quite frankly, very few people could have come to a Commission such as this with a more tarnished background and reputation than Mr Barnard.  But the fact of the matter is that he was a member of the CCB and later the DCC.  He stated his political motivations in regard to his actions quite clearly in his application already and also in bundle K at pages 2622, he clearly stated there what was his intention and  I wish to read it to the Honourable Commission\n\"I was under the impression because I was indoctrinated and brainwashed, and I'm not trying to escape my own accountability, I was under the impression that what I did was justifiable in terms of the struggle that was waged during that time.\"\n\tMy submission with great respect, is that his evidence clearly indicates that he has complied with the criteria set out in the Act, more specifically Section 20(2)(b), even Section 20(2)(f) and also Section 20(2)(g).

            "If I can, I just wish to find that in my Heads where I deal with that.  Yes, that's paragraph 10 on page 4 of my Heads.  With great respect Mr Commissioner, to assess this properly one needs to take cognisance of the fact that Mr Barnard was initially, from the start, treated in a different fashion as any of the other members of the CCB.  He was first of all recruited by Mr Verster himself, which in his own criteria for the discipline in his unit would have been a tremendous security breach.  For him as head of this unit or Director of this unit to have direct contact, as he has stated himself, with an unaware member.\n\tThen if one further has regard to the fact as Mr Barnard has testified, that from the beginning they were not interested in his qualifications in any other use than in his criminal contacts as well as his skill with weaponry.\n\tThen a very important factor which clearly states or shows that he was throughout a member of the CCB, is that he was given a pager, he was given a dead letter box to receive his instructions from, from various members of the CCB.  Through those channels he was instructed, Luitingh had communications with him which it seems from the documentation is common cause.  Various other had ... \n\tBut also a very important factor is that Kobus le Roux from the Namibian branch of the CCB, made contact with him through this pager system.  The only way in which Kobus le Roux could have reached him in this system or know about him or knew how to reach Mr Barnard, was if he was in fact a member of the CCB.  Where would he - I mean it is not as if it is general knowledge to any person, especially in the need-to-know basis in which the CCB operated, that every foreign operator, whoever, would have known about Mr Barnard's involvement and availability in the CCB.\n\tIf one takes these aspects, together with the fact that he received his financial support throughout from the CCB, he had a motor vehicle which he was supplied with as the other aware members, and there's no evidence that any other unaware member was supplied with a motor vehicle of the same calibre in any way as Mr Barnard has been supplied with and on termination or alleged termination of his employment by the CCB, they did not tell him: \"Mr Barnard, bring your vehicle back, bring whatever implements of your trade that you have in your possession, bring everything back\".  So that together with the post facto factor that his legal costs in all the inquests and commission proceedings on a later stage were paid by the Defence Force.\n\tNow the argument was raised that yes, there were also other aspects which were involved with the Goldstone Commission and the Harms Commission, but not in the Webster Inquest.  That was purely an incident which happened during the period when he was - it was only that the inquest dealt with, what they allege he was a rogue agent acting on his own, then it would have been easy to disassociate themselves from him to say: \"We don't know who you are, we don't want to have anything to do with you\".  But that's not what they did.\n\tMr Commissioner, thereafter the immediate transfer of the applicant from the CCB into the DCC, if this security breach with the McQuillan project was viewed in such a serious light, why in heaven's name would they have used him in the next generation of dirty tricks?  That with great respect, is a very clear indication.  That, also coupled with the cross-examination by Mr Wessels of Calla Botha, from the documentation he was referred to and I'm referring to bundle L, page 3316, it is clear from the questioning that happened there and the summations that were made there, that in fact Mr Barnard was considered to still be a member of the CCB, because they said they should consider firing him.  And that is at a stage when it was supposedly to have been common cause that he was already fired.\n\tMr Commissioner with great respect, that is one aspect which is very clear, that Mr Barnard was at all relevant times an agent in the service of the CCB.  When Gen Webb testified I questioned him on the applicability of the regiment of discipline, I believe that in English that is the translation, whether that was applicable to also members of the CCB, for example Mr Barnard, and the answer was yes, categorically yes. \n\tNow understandably we are dealing here with a secretive organisation which you cannot hire and fire and think you can do that with impunity, because of the knowledge that people have and they might bear a grudge, but at least to fire a person from such a position there had to be some kind of a disciplinary hearing or a trial or whatever kind of action needed to be taken to just summarily dismiss a person.  The risk of just telling you today: \"You're an agent, you know all this about this secretive organisation, now we fire you\", with great respect, it is highly unlikely that an organisation such as the CCB would have done that.  They would have redeployed a person, they would have handled him differently.  Which is exactly what they did here, they handled him differently.  They used him as the dog to do the dirty work.  Which is exactly what he had to do.  \n\tThis organisation was formed as Mr Verster has indicated in his evidence, as a civilian strike force, but where's the strike?  To do the strike you need people to do the strike and that's exactly where Mr Barnard came in.  He was the type of person they were looking for as the strike in the strike force.  Now this put into perspective, the application of Mr Barnard, the fact that he was, whenever there was something that needed to be done which would be in a situation where the ordinary members of the CCB could have been exposed, they bring Mr Barnard to do that kind of work.\n\tFor example, if we can deal with the Omar matter.  On probabilities, with great respect, on probabilities to fly Mr Barnard from Johannesburg to Cape Town to do monitoring of Adv Omar, it doesn't make sense.  He's a person that stands out from the community there, he even complained that in what he had to do he was so visible that it would have been extremely dangerous for him and for the organisation to use a person like himself for monitoring purposes.  It is not as if he had any special knowledge about either Adv Omar nor the surroundings in Cape Town.  \n\tIt would have been understandable if Mr Barnard was a person who moved around freely amongst the legal fraternity in Cape Town, to say he has a special ability to monitor Adv Omar, that's why we're going to use him to monitor Adv Omar.  But that was never the intention.  The intention of bringing Ferdi Barnard to Cape Town was to assassinate Adv Omar, and that is exactly what he said he came to do.\n\tMy learned colleague Mr Martini, on two occasions he said that nowhere did Mr Barnard testify that he got an order to assassinate Adv Omar, but the passage which he read himself from page 2668, he read:\n\"I was requested to go and kill Dullah Omar\"\nIt's clearly stated here.\n\tFurthermore, reference was made to the finding of Judge Els on his matter of guilt, and I'm referring to the bundle which we were supplied with extracts from the Ferdi Barnard Judgment and as it is numbered here with an 11, but it's actually page 230 from the Judgment, and I'm going to read it for the benefit of the Commission.  It's in Afrikaans:\n\"We are satisfied that Barnard's evidence regarding the affidavit which the accused made, can be accepted.  According to the statement he waited for Omar outside the house with the firearm in order to shoot him dead.  We are satisfied that the accused intended to commit murder and that this action can be regarded as an executive action.\"\nExactly as the testimony of Mr Barnard stated he did.  There's no discrepancy there at all.  \n\tWith regard to the credibility of Mr Barnard, with great respect, if the only criticism that can be levelled against him is his evidence regarding the firearm, whether he got it via Slang van Zyl from Peaches, or directly from Peaches.  With great respect, that is minuscule.  It is not necessarily the hand that hands it to you, it is where does it come from?  It comes from Peaches.  And that with great respect, that tends on probabilities in this matter, this is not even probabilities, this is probabilities.  \n\tIf one then also looks at the Apie project, with great respect Mr Commissioner, and it is hearsay evidence what Mr Barnard has testified, but it is the only credible explanation that there could be for the actions.  Why else would an organisation such as the CCB be involved with games?  Because to scare the gardeners, with great respect, can never be the priority of such an organisation.\n\tIf one feels tempted to criticise Mr Barnard for his testimony and the fact that he did not apply for amnesty for these various acts, for example the killing of David Webster, the Rosskam matter, even possibly Mark Francis's murder, it must be noted that the government had run away from him, from their responsibility with regard to Mr Barnard.  Is it really so necessary then or absolutely that you can blame him from running away from his acts?  It follows, I mean the government runs away from me and my acts, let me run away from it myself, I'm also not going to stand for anything that you can't prove.  I'm not going to stand for anything like that.  \tAnd that's why - the only thing he knew that they could prove was his involvement with the Apie project and with the Omar project, that's why he made that application.  And with great respect, that Mr Barnard lied his whole life, that is so, but to say here that Mr Barnard can not be believed for what he came to tell this Commission, because of the fact that he was a liar previously in his life, that would disqualify, with great respect, almost seventy percent of all applicants that have appeared in these applications.  And basically all of these applicants ... ipso facto, because not one of them stands here with a clean slate.  Perhaps excluding Gen Webb, but the rest of them - maybe Gen Webb as well, but the rest of all the applicants in most of applications - I haven't been involved in so many, have been people with a background of deception and lies.\n\tTo deal with an aspect of proportionality regarding the actions of Mr Barnard, it is serious actions, to go out and assassinate a person in the likes of Adv Omar cannot be justified and I do not attempt to justify the actions, but one needs to take into consideration that you get an agent here who is instructed to go and murder, for him to go and assess and evaluate the information with which he is supplied, it is not reasonable to expect of him, the man to do the dirty work now to go and follow up and see whether the information with which he is supplied which identifies the target, whether that information is correct.  He's supplied with information and with a task. 'this is the man, he needs to be taken out because this is what he's doing and this is the danger which he poses'.\n\tIf one takes reasonability into account that's what his task is, that is what is in his mind, that is what he's going to go and do.  And if he then with hindsight, shows that it was an unlikely target or a target which should never have been identified, with great respect, that blame cannot be put before him, in front of him, because that is not where he fits into a long line of operatives with various line functions.  For example, you do information, you do this, you do that.\n\tIf one takes into account the evidence of Mr Verster regarding the civilian strike force it is, with respect, clear that the applicant acted within the course and scope of his employment with the CCB.  And the argument might be raised that he did that for money because of the bonuses which he received, but one needs to take into consideration that certainly nobody, not nobody, there are few people that will be prepared to take that kind of risk just for king and country.  To say: \"I'm such a patriot, don't pay me, I'll do the dirty work for nothing\", and that's unfortunately not a very realistic picture.  We had a person here who came out of prison, who took up employment and who had the opportunity of getting remunerated for that employment.  But that does not take away from the fact that what he did, he did in the line of his duty in the course of scope, that he associated himself with the struggle which was currently at that stage on everybody's mind ...(intervention)",

            "Thank you, Mr Chairman.\n\tMr Chairman, I will obviously rely on all solid and favourable submissions made by any of my learned colleagues and the rest I will distance myself from for obvious reasons.  I will try not to repeat any submissions made before.  May I just briefly refer firstly to a matter I deal with in my Heads, the background to the amnesty process, on page 2 of the Heads.  \n\tNow I do submit that this aspect is very important in the whole context of the application by the applicants.  I refer to the fact that this was in fact also included in the Interim Constitution as an epilogue and furthermore I refer to the fact that Section 48 of the current Act 34/95, in fact also refers to the fact that the criteria set out in the repealed Act should be taken into consideration.\n\tIf I may just briefly refer to that.  I have annexed it to my Heads, the two previous Acts as well as the Government Notices.  Without now referring to that in detail I wish to submit that it is clear that throughout it was the intention of the government as well as the opposing parties at the time, the ANC and others, that all people should be treated equally.  It did not matter whether they were supporting the apartheid regime or whether they were freedom fighters.  That was the intention, not only, obviously, of the government of the time, but also of the ANC and others and that appears clearly, for instance, from this Notice 12834 of the 7th November 1990, which actually embodied decisions taken at the Groote Schuur Minute, between the government and the African National Congress.\n\tNow it is important, because I will be referring to the Heads of Argument on behalf of the victims, where it is in fact stated by my learned friends for the victims that a distinction should be made.  It boils down to that if one reads between the lines and what they say.  I will be referring to that.\n\tNow if I can then, without further referring, if necessary I can refer to the repealed Acts further, but I don't think it's necessary. If I can then go back to my Heads where I make the submission on page 3, paragraph 2.4:\n\"that the spirit and the objective of national unity and reconciliation, specifically those of the amnesty process is then provided for in Act 34/95\"\nit should be interpreted in terms of the objectives of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, to which I have already referred in terms of the epilogue.  Now that very same situation was dealt with by the Constitutional Court in a matter of Azapo and Others.  I refer to that on paragraph 2.5.  Now the reason why I just want to make mention of that is because of the fact that my learned friends for the victims also referred to the case.  On page 19 of their Heads, they do refer to quite another paragraph, obviously for, I would say obvious reasons, paragraph 16 where they then quote the then Deputy-President, Mohammed and where they say or especially refer to the section where he said that he could understand that the victims would want the applicants for amnesty who supported the previous government, to be vigorously prosecuted and effectively be punished for the callous and inhuman conduct in violation of the criminal law.\n\tNow we obviously agree with that paragraph and with the view of such victims, but what Judge Mohammed did was to then refer - in fact, what happened here is that he refused the application by Azapo to have Section 27 declared unconstitutional, for good reasons.  After referring to the epilogue which I quote on page 4, he then went on to say, paragraph 2.6 page 4 of my Heads, and this is very important, so important that I do wish to just briefly read it out:\n\"In the result, I am satisfied that the epilogue to the Constitution authorised and contemplated an amnesty (and this is important) in the most comprehensive and generous meaning, so as to enhance and optimise the prospects of facilitating the constitutional journey from the shame of the past to the promise of the future.\"\nAnd may I immediately interrupt myself to say that obviously the applicants I represent are part of the shameful past and obviously the acts for which they apply for amnesty are criminal acts of the most serious kind and that is why they are here, to ask for amnesty.\n\tAnd then the Judge proceeds to say:\n\"They (referring to the Parliament) could conceivably have chosen to differentiate between the wrongful acts committed in defence of the old order and those committed in the resistance of it, or they could have chosen a comprehensive form of amnesty which did not make the distinction.  Again they were entitled to make the latter choice ...\"\nand to which I added \"as they in fact did\", Mr Chairman.  \tSo it's all very well to refer Security Forces of the day and to their despicable deeds and to imply that these people had all the powers of the State in their hands, that they could have locked up people without trial, that we had the Emergency Rules and Regulations to their disposal.  \n\tEverything said is true, but what has to be kept in mind is that the parties when after 1990 they got together and the specific party, let's refer to the ANC, for instance, they were part and parcel of this decision to which the Constitutional Court here refers, they were part of drafting the Interim Constitution and they decided that there should be no distinction between the people supporting the struggle and those supporting the old dispensation and for that purpose they drafted the Constitution, the Interim Constitution and the epilogue thereto.   And as the Judge stated here, parliament then was entitled to make this decision and they did and we have to live with that decision, and this Committee has to judge the applications of the applicants in that light.  \n\tThere may be people dissatisfied with that, obviously there will be, but it's a decision made parliament and we have to respect that.  And that is all to further the national unity and reconciliation in this country.\n\tHaving said that while the submission now therefore is that in fact this Committee should interpret Act 34/95 then in its widest and most liberal form it can, in view of the Judge's words that a most comprehensive and generous meaning of the amnesty term was intended by the legislature.  That is the first aspect.\n\tThe second aspect then is referring to the test which this Committee should apply in terms of Section 20.  My submission is that in fact the definition referred ... satisfy as set out in the supplementary Heads of my learned friends for the victims, on page 4 of their supplementary Heads: Afrikaans Press, the 1948 decision where it's stated:\n\"I take satisfy to mean therefore that a Court must feel that there is a fair probability that the Defendant's defence is a good one.\"\nNow I submit that if one looks at this full paragraph, this could not mean on a balance of probabilities, it's a fair probability and ...(indistinct) on a balance of probabilities in my respectful submission, is two different things.",

Well firstly, I wish to indicate that if the legislature intended to impose an onus on the applicants, certainly the legislature would have said so in as many words it could have been said, and it doesn't state that.  It could have said at the end of Section 20: \"It shall grant amnesty in respect of that act, omission or offence if the applicant satisfies the Committee on a balance of probabilities\".  Why wasn't it stated specifically?  And I don't want to go into the interpretation of Acts, etcetera, etcetera, but I submit that the interpretation most favourable to the subject, in this instance the applicant, should be followed and that interpretation will be that there is not an onus created and it would then mean obviously that a liberal interpretation of the word \"satisfy\" should be followed.\n\tThe problem is that, well over and above the fact that it's not specifically stated in the Act, and it could have been with no problem, is if there is an onus on the applicant, then obviously he should be granted a fair trial.  I submit that then the rules of the rules of evidence will have to be applied, like in a formal trial.  \n\tNow for instance, in this matter we had reference to Section 29 statements on which many of the applicants had been questioned without any problem, because as far as I am concerned this is an open process in the spirit of reconciliation, where a person could be confronted with certain facts, hearsay evidence, etcetera, etcetera, as had been allowed here, and that he could give his comment to that.  He can obviously tender whatever evidence he wishes to, and at the end of the day the Committee will form an impression of whether it is satisfied or not with what he said and whether it could be as Mr Wessels expressed, whether it could be then accepted as a reasonable possibility of what had happened.\n\tNow if one then says that the applicants have an onus as in a trial, for instance as in a criminal trial or a civil trial rather, then it does create several problems and the fact is that, for instance in this case the applicants applied, they were some of the first people who in terms of the very first Act, applied for amnesty back in 1991.  So what happened, they were also heard in Bloemfontein and those facts were never disputed.  In terms of the second Act, no result given.  Then they had to wait.  \n\tThey were some of the first ones applying, they had to wait until the very last moment before their case is heard.  I submit that in a trial situation, if they were to carry an onus the point may have been raised and may have been taken, that they didn't have a fair trial because of the long period that it took for the case to come to trial.  And again, obviously they would be prejudiced to a large extent if inadmissible evidence like the Section 29 statements were tendered in evidence.  \n\tAnd I do submit that in a trial situation if a court of law allowed, incorrectly allowed for instance, reference to evidence like the Section 29 statements as an irregularity, it wasn't done for instance in a trial within a trial, assessing whether it could be submitted or not and an irregularity was committed, then for instance, the applicants would have been entitled to approach the Supreme Court or to bring an application for the Presiding Officer or Officers to withdraw from the case or take the matter on review, because of the fact that irregularities were committed.\n\tSo I submit that - also, if one has a look at the Act, it is clear that there is no prescription of the exact procedure to be followed, or that the rules of evidence as in civil or criminal trials has to followed.  This is an open procedure to be followed in terms of the rules of natural justice and it does not burden the applicants with an onus to prove anything beyond a reasonable doubt.  It's an impression that the Panel has to form on the evidence in totality at the end of the day.  And I submit that it cannot be anything different than to find whether the submissions made or the so-called defence by the applicants for what they did was reasonably possibly true and not on a balance of probabilities.\n\tSo that concludes my submissions on that point.  It has been dealt with in Mr Martini's Heads and also in the Heads which I submitted as an annexure in the Craig Williamson matter.  I therefore urge the Committee to find that the applicants do not carry an onus to prove on a balance of probabilities.\n\tI will then move on to the requirements faced by the applicants I represent.  May I refer to page 7 of the Heads of Argument, it's dealt with with reference to page 7 and 4.1 is then the first element.  The application ...(end of side A of tape)  ... the victims, that the Committee should take cognisance of the fact that the applications made by the applicants are defective.  Now I submit that this first requirement in terms of Section 20(1)(a) is merely a formal requirement, that is just to qualify to have the application heard and nothing more than that.  Obviously the Committee can take cognisance of what is stated in that application.  For instance, the applicants I represent, all of them conceded that there are discrepancies in their applications as compared to the evidence before the Committee, but I submit that what is important is the evidence here in terms of Section 19(4).  This is a procedure where a hearing is held and they must be judged on what they said here and not on what they said in their application, although obviously it can be taken into consideration when an opinion is formed as to whether they satisfied the requirements or not.  So I submit as far as the first, 4.1 is concerned, the first element, that in fact they qualified for their applications to be heard ...(intervention)",

            "...(sound cut off) ... before even getting to the merits of what they are asking.  In any event, 4.1, that concludes 4.1.\n\tAs far as 4.2 is concerned:\n\"the act or offence must have been committed by the applicant having been a member of the Security Forces of the State, as defined in the Act.\"\nNow here once again my learned friends for the victims in their Heads of Argument are in fact stating that the applicants do not qualify in terms of the definition of Security Forces.  But I do not see them mentioning that Security Forces includes any full-\ntime, a member (and I wish to underline) or agent of the South African Defence Force.\n\tNow my submission in my Heads as from page 8 and further - no, sorry a bit later, page 10 and further, is that the term Security Forces in fact includes the term: \"agent of the South African Defence Force\".  I then go into the background of the CCB and make the same submissions virtually as Mr Martini was making, that because of the fact that they were State funded and also responsible to account to the SADF, they have a General who is their Chairman, obviously a highest authority, that it can definitely not be said that they are not members of the Security Forces.  \n\tI go further to point out that the TRC Report in fact finds that the CCB represented a new method of State directed warfare in South African context, part of the Special Forces.  And I submit that that finding by the TRC in their Report is in fact correct and should be followed by this Committee.  \n\tBut I then go further to say on page 12, that in the alternative, the CCB was acting as an agent of the South African Defence Force, and I submit that there could be no quarrel with that.  Clearly, if the CCB was contracted by the South African Defence Force, as my learned friends for the victims are suggesting, to just do their dirty work, being paid for that with State funds, then surely it must be said that each and every individual then working for the CCB, must have been an agent of the South African Defence Force, and as such they would fall under this definition.\n\tThe further enquiry would then obviously be whether they were committing these deeds for gain or not or whether from political motive, but that's quite another enquiry.  And my submission is that they should easily clear the first hurdle, stating that they would fall under the definition of Security Forces, as defined in the Act.  That concludes that point.\n\tThen as far as 4.3 is concerned:\n\"the act or offence must have been committed by the applicant in the course and scope of his duties within the scope of his expressed or implied authority or he must have had reasonable grounds to believe so\"\nis found on page 12 and further.  \n\tNow I submit here that it has never been disputed that these applicants were all employed by the CCB.  The nature of the CCB was never disputed and in fact, I again refer to the TRC Report and findings, especially on page 384 of Exhibit D, the CCB was a secret, apparently civilian strike force which was to supplement the Special Forces of the SADF.  The purposes of the CCB, as we've heard many a time, death, infiltration, bribery, compromise and blackmail or destruction.  We know that they've been, all three my applicants at least, have been on an induction course where they've been addressed by Verster and even Generals, as to the background, why the CCB is necessary, who the enemy is, what they should do, what they are entitled to do, that there was a war situation.  I'm not only referring to the TRC Report, but it was in this hearing confirmed by Verster who was the Managing Director, it was said by Gen Joop Joubert who was the Chairman before Webb.  So I submit that at all times relevant to any of the acts my clients apply for amnesty for, it is clear that they were not acting in their private capacities, but they were acting as members of the CCB.\n\tAnd I submit further that they had no reason, that's Burger and Basson as well as Maree, that they had no reason not to believe that they were acting in the course and scope of their duty.  Now what I'm referring to here obviously, is the fact that there is a dispute between Verster and Webb as to whether certain authority was given and in the cases of Omar and Evans.  I submit that it cannot affect Basson and Burger, because they didn't know that.  We must at all times, keep in mind that we had to do here with cut off points.  Burger and Basson weren't allowed to walk into - well they weren't even allowed into the offices of Special Forces at Headquarters, but they weren't allowed to walk into the General's offices and ask him whether Verster did in fact get his approval or not.  There were cut off points and they were working on instructions.  So if it's said that they were not acting within the course and scope of their duties in the Omar and Evans matters, then it must be said at least, that they had reasonable grounds to believe so.  And I then submit that as far as this requirement is concerned, obviously they also qualify.\n\tThen 4.4 is referring to Section 20(2) and 20(1)(b) and there are several Sections referred to there.  That is:\n\"The act must have been advised, planned, directed, commanded, ordered, committed with a political motive or objective, in the course of the conflict of the past.\"",

            "That's correct.  Thank you, Mr Chairman.\n\tThe position as far as this is concerned I make the point that as far as the requirement that it was committed in the course of the conflict of the past is concerned, I do not think that one should even argue that, I think that that at least is common cause, that there was conflict in the country during that period and that's 1999(sic) period and that one accept that as given.  The fact or the question would be whether they were entitled in view of that conflict, to do what they have done, but that I will deal with later.\n\tThe second leg there would be whether they had a political motive, etcetera.  Now the point is made by the representatives for the victims, and very strongly done, that the applicants were doing what they did for money, for gain, that they were furthering their careers and they didn't have any political motive or very little political motive.\n\tNow I respectfully submit that this was never put to them.  All three my clients dealt with this very aspect in their evidence.  If I can point out page 1851 of the record and further, as far as Burger is concerned, he deals with the fact that he grew up as an Afrikaner boy, a member of the National Party, later supporting the white government and protecting the sovereignty of the Afrikaner and the State.  Now same goes for - without going into all the detail, I can just give the page numbers from 2169 and further Basson deals with this and in the same vein it is dealt with by Maree from page 2520 and further. \n\tNow I submit that perhaps this submission by my learned friends for the victims shows how far the people of this country are still apart when it comes to understanding each other and the motives which had driven the different sections of the population in the past, to say that people who state that they had an Afrikaner background, they were supporters of the apartheid regime, let's call it like that, because that's the fashion, it was an illegal government as far as the victims were concerned, governing the country, a government for the minority.

            "The fact is however, just to answer to what Mr Bizos has just said that that is the second leg of his argument and it will be clear from his Heads of Argument how strong he makes the point that they didn't have the necessary political motive, but the fact of the matter is that it must be remembered, in answer to what he just said, that these people were drafted into the CCB by Verster, who told them what the purposes were of the CCB and it is clear, and I can refer to the record, that at that stage it wasn't done very elaborately with all the detail as it later appeared.\n\tIt must remembered that as far as Burger, for instance, is concerned and his evidence is very clear, it was said that this was a covert organisation, that they were going to fight the enemies of the State, etcetera, but the details only emerged six months later.  \tSo when Burger and Maree at least, were drafted into the CCB, they were not aware of all the detail and that was only given to them six months down the road when they were established in the CCB, they were busy establishing their blue plans, etcetera, etcetera.  So it cannot be argued that at the stage when they were appointed into the CCB, that they had a financial motive and that it was said to them: \"Look what we are needing you people for is to kill the enemies of the State for gain\".  I submit that that was never said and it was only made clear to them about how the CCB was going to function, six months down the road, and that was also the evidence of Basson.  And I submit that it was never at any stage disputed by the victims that it was not so and that they were in fact then given contracts as hitman by the CCB right from the start.  Now I therefore submit that that argument by the victims' representatives does not hold water.  \n\tIf I may just then proceed to the next point.  The context of the Act, I've actually deal with to a certain extent and at the moment I would just like to briefly refer to it again.  Now it's found on page 17 and further.  I once again submit that it is clear that the impression at least, the perception of the applicants was that there was total onslaught, an undeclared civil war where the ANC and its front organisations were waging in the country.  That was the evidence of Burger, at page 1853.  That was the context of the time.  I refer to that.  The Emergency Regulations were in place.  \tThe argument by the victims is you could have used the Emergency Regulations, you could have detained these people without trial for so many months, but the point is, just a bit later on in their Heads they do concede virtually, saying that those regulations were not working.  And it's also stated, that much is also stated in the TRC Report to the President, that the government in 1984 thought they'd turned the corner, but they didn't and then the unrest spread throughout the country.  There was virtual panic in government circles and in the SADF and they had to evolve new methods to address the position. I submit that that is the context in which the acts by the applicants should be judged.  \tAnd I make the point a bit later in my Heads that this in fact is a very important factor, because when having regard to the requirements in Section 20(3), it does not say that the applicants have to comply with Section 20(3)(a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) and that they have to prove on a balance of probabilities that they comply with each of these.  In fact, it says that this is a question which has to be decided with reference to those points.  \n\tAnd what my argument is on page 30 and further, is that in fact, if one then has regard to the fact that this was the context of the acts and furthermore that these people were employed by the Security Forces and they were acting under orders, that that has to carry weight.  And if one then has regard to that, the weight of the fact that, for instance the proportionality of the act to the objective pursuit, is perhaps a bit disproportionate, because it can never be exactly equal. Then one has to consider the context and the fact that they were standing under orders and that in fact a government and a General were approving their actions.  So it's a process of weighing all these different factors, which has to work to the advantage of the applicants.\n\tIf I may just go back to my Heads.  The next point is in the legal and factual nature of the act which I deal with, with reference to all the different acts.  Now I'm not going to read through this in detail, obviously.  We make the concession here that all of these acts were of an exceptionally grave nature, the bombing, the possibility of loss of life there, obviously the two attempts to murder.  It must be grave.  It's a planned, preplanned murder and this was not voluntarily stopped by the CCB because they realised that their actions were wrong, there were others why it didn't proceed.  But what I do submit obviously then, is the fact that no - on page 21, mercifully, no-one was seriously injured or killed.  That has to be taken into consideration.  And once again on page 21 I refer to the background, the context of the acts.\n\tI wish to make the submission here that with reference the submissions by the victims, that the actual intention was to kill the people at the ELC, I wish to make the submission that this cannot be found on a balance of probabilities, to have been the situation.  I make the submission that as far as my clients are concerned, Burger and Basson more particularly, they were not at the scene, they cannot be held responsible for what Van Zyl may have done or not have done.  Obviously they were totally ignorant of the fact that, for instance, Barnard was used in other instances where Omar was concerned and ...(intervention)",

What I submit here is that in each of these instances - page 22, as far as each of these instances is concerned, it cannot be said that the object or objective of the act was unrelated to the political situation in the country, the context of violence, the context in which the CCB functioned.  As far as the bombing of the Early Learning Centre is concerned, I submit that Van Zyl obviously obtained the information in the first instance, he gave that to his superiors, being Burger and Basson, and that information was in turn then given to Verster.\n\tNow it was said in evidence that, and by Van Zyl as well, that he did not obtain all the information which subsequently appeared on record regarding the Early Learning Centre.  So obviously someone obtained something further and Burger and Basson are saying is that they knew that Verster had his own channels to obtain further information or to check out information with other sectors of the security community and that as far as they were concerned, the information did not only come from Van Zyl and from his informers in the Western Cape, but it was dealt with correctly in terms of the procedure which the CCB created, and one must now remember - and may I just interrupt here to say that as far as Basson is concerned Burger had no information sources of his own, he was not allowed to speak to anyone to check out information.  Basson had to do it in terms of the contact he had with Derrick.  Now he - and that was the prescription by the CCB, he had to check it out with the information officer, Derrick and then it would come back to him, confirmed or not confirmed, and they would act on that basis, and obviously that would be taken up with Verster.  And the impression was that he had his own sources.  \n\tAnd as far as the Early Learning Centre is concerned this is one of the examples where Van Zyl gave certain information and when the instructions came back from Verster and Webb, there was further information.

It didn't come from Basson, because he couldn't check out the information with Derrick at the time, but someone added that information and it could only have been, as far as my applicants are concerned, it could only have been Verster or Webb.  And the instruction came from Webb.\n\tSo point I'm making is not that that information was necessarily correct, but the point is that both Basson and Burger had all reason to believe that this operation has been approved, in terms of the workings of the CBB as prescribed.  They didn't have reason to believe that no-one checked out the information and that innocent individuals were going to be targeted.  That's the point I'm making.\n\tAnd then I go further to say as far as the ELC is concerned, one must take into consideration the evidence of Mr Alexander, and from it it is clear that there was information, at least, existing within the community.  There was conflict in that community between certain people, whether they were gangsters or not.  But it must be remembered that Burger and Basson were not footsoldiers at the scene in the Cape, so they couldn't check this out, but Mr Alexander makes it clear that they were all political activists, they were known to Hardien, etcetera, they Security Police were interested in them, they were having their meetings at different places to avoid the police, etcetera.  So at least, this is not a matter where you had totally incorrect information, where the people concerned were not politically minded at all.  Mr Alexander ...(intervention)",

            "Yes, but it has ...(sound cut off) ... Mr Alexander was a member of both Kewtown Youth Movement and the Cape Youth Congress.  They were affiliated.  He was a representative of Kewtown Youth Movement on the Cape Youth Congress.  And then furthermore, they were then affiliated to other organisations eventually affiliated to the UDF.  So I'm not trying to make the point that anyone was entitled to harm these people because of their political motivations, but once again one must see the full picture, the context of the time, Emergency Regulations, etcetera, etcetera.  You cannot take this piece by piece and say if you look at their political profile, they're small fry, Kewtown Youth Movement is not the Cape Youth Congress, they weren't having secretive meetings, etcetera.  One has to look at the full picture, all the elements as listed in (3) of Section 20.\n\tAnd furthermore, one has to say this then also in favour of the applicants, that yes, in fact the people who were in the building were Cape Youth Movement and they were not supposed to be there - well, not supposed to be there, but they didn't have a planned meeting, they only decided on that meeting that very same evening, minutes before they gathered.  And it is common cause that the Kewtown Youth Movement adjourned early and they were going home and they did in fact go home and only then did the Cape Youth Movement meet in the boardroom.\n\tNow I submit that if Van Zyl was acting on information by Hardien and Hardien got the information of the Kewtown Youth Movement's meeting and he saw them going home, that he wouldn't know about the Cape Youth Movement and their meeting.  Now it is so that there's evidence about cars parked, etcetera, but also in my heads I refer to this whole situation saying that one must remember that these people met at Kriek(?) and from there they would then decide where they would have their meetings, to escape the attentions of the police.\n\tNow I cannot see for the life of me if you are so secretive, why you would take your car and drive from Kriek a couple of metres or - it was indicated on the map, and go and park all the cars of the people involved, right in front of the place where you are meeting.  And it is clear from Mr Alexander's evidence that those people in fact walked over from Kriek to the ELC.\n\tNow I'm making these submissions just to indicate that this is not a cut and dried cases where one can say that Hardien definitely knew about these 15 people in the boardroom, but there in fact, it's common cause that there were at least soccer players there.  But then we had the evidence referred to earlier, for instance, that the hall was locked.  \n\tNow my submission is that it cannot be said that these people were in fact planning to kill persons gathering in a hall.  If the hall was for instance, on the statements we saw, at that stage locked.  Although Hardien didn't say that he noticed that it was locked, that I also concede, but the fact of the matter is at the end of the day, can it be found as a fact that they intended killing the people gathered in the ELC.\n\tI then further refer to the Omar and Evans matters.  I submit that at least, which can be accepted, is that Mr Omar had a high political profile, it was not contested at all that he was a high profile leader in the United Democratic Front, they were banned in terms of the Emergency Regulations, and it was never contested nor, I think will it be, that the UDF was a front organisation for the ANC, nothing more than that.  And it is borne out by the fact that immediately after the election Mr Omar was appointed as Minister of Justice.  But ...(intervention)",

            "What should be taken into consideration is that this was information which was to the disposal of the applicants, they truly believed it, they - and this was checked out by the information section of the CCB, through Derrick, the evidence came back and if it wasn't true then at least they bona fide believed it.  And on that basis they are saying that they are entitled to amnesty, even if it wasn't true then.\n\tThe next point is whether the act was committed in the execution of an order and with the approval of the organisation the applicant was a member or agent for.\t  I submit that - that's under 4.4.5, I submit that as far as this is concerned on page 28 and further, there could be no dispute that all three the applicants I represent, in fact acted as members of the CCB at all relevant times.\n\tAnd then 4.4.6 is then the relationship between the act or offence and then also the proportionality question.  I have dealt with that on pages 30 and 31.  I've already referred to that.  I submit that this is a very important part of the argument, but I'm not going to repeat it.  It has to be seen in the full context of the time.  And I submit that there was a direct relationship between the act or offence and the political objective.  \n\tIf we take the ELC, the information was that those people were so-called terrorists, they were going to let off bombs, they were interfering with the election in that way.  At least we know from Mr Oesman Alexander that even if he only conceded that they were educating people not to vote in the tri-cameral election, at least they were involved, they were politically involved and he considers himself to be an activist.\n\tNow immediately I say again, obviously I'm not saying that seen in isolation that would be now a reason to set off a bomb in the place they're meeting, but it must be seen in the full context.  So if we deal with this specific factor, I submit that there is a direct relationship between the offence and the political objective.  \n\tAnd if we then quickly proceed to Mr Omar's matter, the same thing can be said again, prominent figure, he's perceived to be a very important leader figure in the UDF, it is perceived that if he is harmed, if he is killed it would disrupt the enemy.  And I would submit with respect that the applicants, on the information they had, were justified in thinking so.\n\tAs far as the conspiracy to murder Gavin Evans is concerned, I deal with that on page 34 and 35, I submit that - well it should read ECC and not EEC in that paragraph, 5.38.3, what the ECC was doing was to encourage people not to due their military training and serve in the SADF.  And I make the submission that in many countries in the world that would be met by a very severe reaction if person does that, obviously not in a democratic State, like we were supposed to be, but we all know we were not and that's why people like Mr Evans was trying to change the system.\n\tNow again the perception of these people, the applicants, they were part of the Security Forces and the South African Defence Force and their perception was if Mr Evans and people similarly minded carry on with what they were doing, it would destroy the moral of the South African Defence Force and it could lead to the overturning of the State.  They were then trying to preserve the sovereignty of that very State.  So I submit that once again there is a direct relationship between act and political objective. \n\tThe Apie incident I then also refer to, I don't want to waste time on that further.\n\tRegarding the foetus at Bishop Tutu's house, I just make the submission regarding Barnard and Van Zyl, that this Committee would not be able to find which one of the two are telling the truth.  I submit that with Barnard's background and with the fact that he is a self-confessed liar, that is his own evidence, and with Van Zyl's evidence, even though he may have contradicted himself here and there and also in previous hearings or documentation, this Committee will not be able to make a decision and say: \"I'm going to accept Barnard's evidence\" or \"I'm going to accept Van Zyl's evidence\".  My submission is that the decision should be that as far as Van Zyl is concerned, he will be judged on his evidence and as far as Barnard is concerned, one could possibly accept his evidence and judge his application by his own evidence, but the Committee will not be able to make a decision that Barnard's evidence is now accepted and Van Zyl's evidence is rejected, because on what basis is one going to reject Van Zyl's evidence and accept Barnard's?\n\tAnd the importance as far as my applicants are concerned is that I'm suggesting that this Committee will not be able to find as a fact that there was a so-called five point plan, firstly.  And secondly, even if it is found that there was in fact such a five point plan, there's no indication that Burger or Basson was aware of that.\n\tThen as far as 4.5 is concerned at page 8, the offence must not have been committed for personal gain.  There was the evidence of Van Zyl that he gave certain monies to Burger and Burger stole that money.  I submit that the Committee would not be able to make a decision here again, to believe Van Zyl, or for that matter, to believe Burger.  Now the fact of the matter is, Van Zyl had the money, he gave some of it to Barnard, for the same price he could have kept some of the money for himself.  Burger is denying that he ever received the money back from Van Zyl, so Van Zyl may have used the money for some other purpose, but for reasons of his own he's now saying that Burger took it.  But I submit that there is no reason or no ground on which Van Zyl's evidence could be preferred to that of Burger's.  But even if it is accepted that Burger did take the money, then it was done ex post facto, after the offence was done.  It can not be argued in any manner, that he planned this offence, the ELC matter, with the purpose of taking money from the budgeted amount.  There was no suggestion like that made to him at any stage.\n\tThen lastly, the applicant must make a full disclosure of all relevant facts.  Once again ...(sound cut off) and I will rather use the opportunity in view of the later hour, to answer tomorrow if necessary, to the argument of my learned friends for the victims.  \n\tNow I submit in my Heads that the term \"relevance\" has a certain meaning in law and it should not only be relevant, but sufficiently relevant - it's found on page 37 and 38, I'm not going to deal with that in detail at the moment.  The fact is, the question that has to be asked is, would any of the matters or the acts perhaps done in foreign countries, is there any indication that the facts pertaining to those actions would have any bearing on this case, would be relevant to the facts in the instances the applicants apply for amnesty?  And I submit that there is no such indication that these acts were logically linked to any other actions in foreign countries.  And if that is so and it cannot be found that any such other actions which may or may not have existed, would be logically relevant to these acts, then it cannot be found that the applicants did not make full disclosure.\n\tNow it is submitted by my learned friends for the victims, and they mention numbers here, I will refer to that briefly tomorrow if necessary, but they mention numbers of so many projects, etcetera, etcetera and so much money spent by the CCB.  \n\tIt has to be remembered that Maree was a footsoldier in Region 6, there were cut off points, he didn't have any knowledge of how big the CCB may have been and what they may have done or may not have done and where they may have operated or may not have operated.  \n\tAnd as far as Basson is concerned, he was the Regional Coordinator, he did work in other regions as well, but it also cannot be said that he was so high up in this organisation that he should have had knowledge of any of those.\n\tAnd as far as Burger is concerned, we know that he was limited strictly to Region 6 and he was only the Regional Manager and he wasn't allowed to contact any of the other regions' Regional Managers, because of the very fact that he was a high profile person, at that stage in the sense that he was known as the ex-Commander of Brixton.  So obviously those statistics which are quoted by my learned friends for the victims, can not be held against any of the applicants I appear for.\n\tAnd I then make the submission that with reference to all the requirements as set out in paragraph 4 of my Heads, that all three the applicants in fact did comply with all the elements.  \n\tAnd may I just briefly refer to Maree specifically.  I submit that as far as Burger and Basson are concerned, for their own reasons they didn't want to give evidence about foreign matters.  As far as Maree is concerned, he did not hesitate to make full disclosure of his full involvement with the CCB and this aspect or this criticism levelled by my learned friends, obviously does not pertain to Maree himself, he made a full disclosure also of any foreign matters he was involved in.\n\tThat concludes my argument unless there are other aspects you wish to hear me on, Mr Chairman.",

This is again in relation to Calla Botha's evidence.\n\tNow if we go to paragraph 8:\n\"The evidence of the applicants that Hardien was to be paid R30 000 merely to place in an empty hall a bomb not intended to kill or injure any person, should be rejected as false.\"\nAnd we ask you to look at paragraphs 124 to 127 and paragraph 132.",

In relation to paragraph 18, please look at B275 to 288.  \n\t18.1 is a conclusion, but we would ask you to note there, that we will argue that in relation to the requirement of bona fides, if you could make a note there please Mr Chairman, under 18.1, the requirement of bona fides in Section 20(2)(b), is to be taken into account and we will argue in due course, based upon the Judgment of His Lordship Mr Justice Greenberg, as to what bona fides means, and we will refer you to it, Mr Chairman.  Well whilst I am at it, Mr Chairman, I might as well give you a reference to it, it's Milne NO vs Singh.  Perhaps we should hand it over to you so that you can have a look at it, because we believe that it is of some importance because the words bona fide, the expression has not been addressed by any of the ...  It's Milne NO vs Singh NO and Others and the references - we've given you only one page, Mr Chairman, of the ..., because His Lordship - if you have a look at paragraph E on page 457:\n\"The implication is if he'd honestly taken a wrong view of the legal position, that wrong view or his resulting conduct would not have been weighed against him.\"\nAt page 261, De Villiers, JA, said:\n\"Bona fides is a term of wide import, but I shall assume that it refers to possible prejudice to creditors in an eventual consocis(?) creditorum.\"\nyou can see that I haven't done an insolvency case for a long time, Mr Chairman.  \n\"Using the term in this restricted sense, it is important to remember that good faith demands first, that there shall be absence of definite knowledge that the transaction in question violates the insolvency laws.  And second, that neither of the parties deliberately refrained from giving the other information or from ascertaining the exact state of affairs, for fear that if the information given or the known facts, the transaction might be illegal.\"\n\tIn Rex vs Meyers 1984 1 SA375 (AD) at page 382, Greenberg JA, referred to the well-known passage in Hallsbury, that:\n\"A belief is not honest, which, though in fact entertained by the representor, may have been itself the outcome of a fraudulent diligence in ignorance.  That is of a wilful abstention from all sources of information which might lead to suspicion and a sedulous avoidance of the possible avenues to the truth, for the express purpose of not having any doubt thrown on what he desires and is determined to and afterwards does, in a sense, believe.\"\n\tNow what we say in relation to this and particularly in relation to Mr Van Zyl, that once he comes to the conclusion that this is at the request of Verster, that he must act quickly and that he would be held responsible if another bomb goes off, and he doesn't find out who the owner is, when he could so easily have done so.  He doesn't find out where this youth organisation stands, the Kew organisation, doesn't find out whether the information that one of the leaders had a sister who was killed in a bomb explosion.  He could quite easily have ascertained that by asking you know, what was the name\", and all the others matters on which we cross-examined.  \n\tAnd we are going to place emphasis that bona fides means that you mustn't close your eyes to the obtaining of information which may shake your belief in what you want to do, and we rely on this case for authority.  And you have to be bona fide in this sense in relation to the political objective to be achieved. And I want to give you a simple example.  It may well be that some person in the CCB, and assume that all the requirements are ..., decides that the UDF in the Cape, has a very efficient messenger, he runs around the whole day and he delivers pamphlets and UDF pamphlets so efficiently that: \"Let's kill him and the work of the UDF is going to be impeded and therefore the aims of the UDF, which we be believe to be aligned to the ANC, will not be so easily ...\".\n\tNow I take an extreme example in order to illustrate the point that bona fides are not to be assumed and although there may be some subjectivity in relation to bona fides, the reasonable aspect of it must not be thrown out of the window altogether, you must examine it, you must examine it carefully and not rush into action.  And this is what we really are referring to.\n\tAnd in relation to 18.2, Mr Chairman, that:\n\"Far more effective and far less violent options were available which were far likely to achieve the co-conspirators' purported objectives\"\nThis was a matter raised by you, Mr Chairman, and you will find that in section B, paragraph 280(?).\n\tAnd 18.3:\n\"The manner in which the acts were carried out, occurred with reckless disregard.\"\nWe would refer you to paragraphs 281 to 283, which covers 18.3.1 as well, which is argument Mr Chairman.  Oh, I'm sorry, B, 281 to 283.\n\tIn relation to 18.3.2, that there were people injured and had nothing to do with the KTYM, you will find in paragraph 294B, Mr Chairman.\n\tIn 18.4, that:\n\"We find that the rationale which underpinned the reasoning behind the explosion, was based on information from a clearly unreliable source (could you strike out the \"t\" please).  No evidence was provided to show ...\"\nYou will find that in B351 to 357, Mr Chairman.  And then we say in paragraph 19, that:\n\"All the applicants failed to act within the course of scope of their duties, in that they breached the CCB's internal rules by omitting to do a number of matters.\"\nAnd we would refer you to B167, Mr Chairman.  \n\t191 and 192 are argument and are self-evident on the facts.\n\tPlease read paragraph 20 together with paragraph 28.1.  In view of what Mr du Plessis said about our lack of understanding, Mr Chairman, I want to expand on the submission that we make in paragraph 20.  What we mean by that is this, that it is not enough in the circumstances of the Brixton people, to say that: \"We were members of the National Party\", a couple of million people voted for the National Party.  \"We were brought up in the Dutch Reformed Church and we went to Afrikaans speaking schools, and therefore, (say the applicants who were at Brixton) we changed over\".  Now it may be that if the matter stopped there and if their evidence had been that on a morning they woke up and they said \"you now this business of Murder and Robbery isn't good enough to save our country, we are going to go over to a hit squad in the CCB, in order to save our country\", that was not their predominant motive, on their evidence Mr Chairman.  Mr Chairman, I'm sorry to use the expression, but patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrels.  A good authority for it - a great man said ...(indistinct).  They went over because they were dissatisfied with their conditions of service and they went there because they had such a better deal.  They are to be distinguished, with the greatest respect.\n\tTo take an extreme example, my sister was injured at the Church Street bomb and I said to myself, no I can't sit back and do this, I will go and do the same.  Or I was a soldier, instead of doing police work I went to the Angolan border, my best friend was killed next to me and I thought to myself that this is a war which SWAPO has waged and the ANC is it's ally, and I decided then that I will serve my country by committing unlawful acts, sometimes of a horrible nature and therefore this is my motivation.  \n\tNot one of these applicants, Mr Chairman, has put before you a tittle of evidence what it was in their lives that made them make this change.  Obviously the Attorney-General of the Transvaal was unhappy with the manner in which they supported some of their colleagues whom he believed were guilty of murder, he was making life difficult for them, they decided through Mr Burger's friendship with Mr Verster, to open the door for these people to transfer.  The predominance of motive was the better conditions and not patriotism.",

At that stage, at that time of the approach they don't know it's a hit squad or whatever that's moving in to assist the CCB, wouldn't most young men be tempted to join them and go and say: \"Okay, well that's good, I've got a problem where I'm working, I've got hassles, I've got a much better deal, I'll go across\"?
