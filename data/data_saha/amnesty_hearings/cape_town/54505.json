Earlier you heard me put to this witness other possibilities which he accepted as well.

The explanation of this state of affairs is somewhat weak.  Firstly, Luitingh and Louw claim to have disbelieved Barnard's alleged confession and secondly, Luitingh testified that if he had revealed Barnard's confession to Verster, he would at the same time have revealed his own breaches of security in failing to make a clean break with Barnard and that as he feared for the consequences of his breach of security, he kept his knowledge of Barnard's confession from Verster.\"",

The information that I received from Lafras was that Lafras was clearly nervous.  I cannot quote the conversation in the way in which we had it, but Lafras was worried and he told me because I was aware of the fact that Joe Verster discharged Barnard, Joe Verster's opinion of Barnard was according to what I heard, hearsay, that he believed Ferdi Barnard was a criminal and that there was no position for somebody like him in the organisation.  Lafras asked me and he said that he was worried or concerned that Ferdi Barnard told him something which would put him in a bad position, because if he would he would fire him, which is Lafras.  He then asked him about it.  He was not willing to talk about it.  I realised that he had a problem and Lafras kept quiet or told me to keep quiet and I said that I will not discuss this with anyone, and then he told me that Ferdi Barnard used the English word \"claim\", in that he floored Webster.  These are the words that he used.  And this was an attempt to prove to Joe that he was acceptable, that he can be used by the CCB and that he must not be discharged or fired.\"\nCan you recall that evidence?",

My client has a reasonably serious problem, I must state from the very beginning that he is willing to testify here but he has been approached to make an affidavit in order to facilitate the procedure, but there were two reasons why he will not be making an affidavit.  Firstly, he has reading and writing problems and I would not want him to make an affidavit which he will have to read back in the future.\n\tSecondly, it is clear from the evidence that there are certain serious incriminating answers which will be requested.  He has not applied for amnesty and he has a certain reputation in the Western Cape, which could have serious problems for his rights and it is my instruction to request, in the light of the fact that the Commission has subpoenaed him in terms of Section 29, that a Section 31 Appeal be made for consultation with the Attorney-General within this jurisdiction or the Chief Attorney-General or the Director of Public Prosecutions, before he could actually be requested to answer these questions. \n\tThe second point that I would like to offer is that we would like direction regarding who exactly has subpoenaed him as a witness.  It would not appear to be the applicants because it appears as if their cases have been dealt with.  Would it be persons on behalf of the victims or is it the Committee?  This is my respectful submission that this indication will also influence who has the right to cross-examine him, upon which occasions he may be cross-examined.  If it is the Committee that has called him, then he should testify in the final instance, as it would be in a courtroom situation.  If it is on behalf of those persons who were involved in the Athlone Early Learning Centre, then it would be them who have subpoenaed him and they may cross-examine him and then be satisfied with the answers that he will provide.\n\tSimilarly, this applies to the Committee who should be satisfied with the answers that he can provide.  It has emerged previously with this sort of application and I think specifically of Pik Botha's evidence that he gave, and this is an aspect to be clarified.",

He realises fully that whatever his evidence here, it cannot be used against him in criminal proceedings, but the broad coverage that the proceedings have enjoyed, could plant the seed for prosecution.  And the Act does not state anything specific about indemnity to be granted, but it is my submission that the only reason why there should be consultation with the A-G is for the exploration of the possibility of indemnity and that it indeed be granted.  Why else would there be consultation with the A-G?",

If my client comes forward and states under oath precisely what took place, it may have serious ramifications or could influence the final decision for the instatement of prosecution.\n\tChairperson, just to add to what my learned colleague has said, my client is not unwilling to testify, he has declared his willingness, however I would like to thank the Committee for the fact that they have obtained legal representation for him.  It is clear to me from the past week's consultation that he did not understand everything that is going on.  For example, it is my instruction that he didn't understand the meaning of the amnesty application and that he never applied, and this is due to basic ignorance.  He is one of the persons here who stands a lot to loose.  There could be very grave consequences that he may find himself in, purely because he was subpoenaed as a witness to testify here.",
