<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>MR MOOSA:   In your own words, you are talking about a person </p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a>who is not unintelligent.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a>ADV MOOSA:   I want to put it to you that your version of - </p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a>before I do that, you say you assaulted Mr Kondile, did anyone </p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a>else of the people you mention assault Mr Kondile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   I did say that at one stage he alleged that </p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a>some of the East London people assaulted him during the </p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a>interrogation, but I cannot remember the details.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a>ADV MOOSA:   And what about the Eastern Cape branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   I do not know of a single person except for </p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a>myself who assaulted him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a>ADV MOOSA:   And related to the number of interrogations how </p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a>often did you assault him?  Was it only during one interrogation </p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a>or was there more than one occasion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   If I can recall one case, I concede that there </p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a>might perhaps be two.  That was at the beginning when he was </p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a>transferred from Bloemfontein to the Eastern Cape.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a>ADV MOOSA:   Other time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   I will repeat, I can recall one case and there's </p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a>a possible second time but I don't want to be specific about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a>ADV MOOSA:   Can you be specific about the first time, how did </p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a>you assault him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   I can remember that I slapped him.  There is </p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a>a possibility that I also hit him with a fist.  You must just realise </p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a>that it happened a long time ago and I cannot remember all the </p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a>details.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a>ADV MOOSA:   I realise it happened a long time ago and I also </p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a>realise that you said anything can happen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a>ADV MOOSA:   I am putting it to you that it's most unlikely that </p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a>you would have been so gentle with Mr Kondile.  You would </p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a>more likely have resorted to the electrical shocks and the </p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a>treatment described in Mr Danster's affidavit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   I suppose that's what you would like to hear </p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a>but I can just tell you what happened.  If you have any other </p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a>information I am sorry I cannot help you any further.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a>ADV MOOSA:   In fact it's very likely that you assaulted him so </p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a>severely that the fear of another Biko case was a real one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   Definitely not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a>ADV MOOSA:   When Mr Kondile was arrested, that is in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a>Free State and up to the time he was brought to the Eastern Cape </p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a>what were your real intentions about this man if he refused to </p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a>cooperate what was going to happen to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   That did not come up as far as I can </p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a>remember, I do not want to speculate about that.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a>ADV MOOSA:   You surely speculated about it at the time.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a>There was more than an equal possibility that he would not want </p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a>to cooperate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   Well according to what is said here he </p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a>already made a good contribution.  That was already a very good </p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a>start.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a>ADV MOOSA:   Yes but according to you in any event he didn't </p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a>want to cooperate because he was writing to the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   At the end, yes, but that was only at the end.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a>ADV MOOSA:   What was your thought at the beginning about </p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a>when that possibility eventuates what would you do with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   No, I never speculated about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a>ADV DE JAGER:   Were you always under the impression that he </p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a>was co-operating and giving you the information that you </p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a>required?</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   In the beginning partially, yes, but when we </p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a>questioned him specifically about certain things it became clear to </p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a>me that he wanted to conceal things.  I cannot remember </p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a>specifically what it was but it dealt with, amongst others, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a>pointing out or identification of people in Transkei.   Thereafter </p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a>he gave his full co-operation as I believe him to have done.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a>ADV DE JAGER:   Did he identify the people in the Transkei?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   Yes, he even described at which desk they sat </p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a>in the back, and as a result of this the Transkei police went to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a>back and as a result of their mistakes the two ran away and fled </p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a>through, over the Maseru bridge, fled the country.  And one </p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a>person is Masweyako, I can still recall the surname and I also saw </p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a>it in these documents, as I explained it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a>ADV MOOSA:   Earlier on, that is before lunch time, we spoke </p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a>about the sharing of statements together and you mentioned some </p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a>of the people who could have been present, you did say that that </p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a>happened in Pretoria, could you tell me where exactly in Pretoria?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   In one or other hotel, I cannot recall the </p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a>name, we met on occasion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a>ADV MOOSA:   And were you the only policeman present or </p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a>were there other persons, policemen and ex-policemen of course?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   I cannot think of anybody else who was </p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a>present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a>ADV MOOSA:   As far as the timing of your request for the Free </p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a>State to send Mr Kondile over, having received Security reports </p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a>on a somewhat regular basis from the Free State, why exactly did </p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a>you time it after about two weeks for him to come over to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a>Eastern Cape?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   I did not time it as such.  I had to wait for </p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a>them to transfer the man to us.  The man was arrested in the Free </p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a>State.  I had to wait until they transferred him to us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a>ADV MOOSA:   You have mentioned in your evidence that Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a>Kondile was "booked out" a few times, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a>ADV MOOSA:   Do you remember plus/minus how many times it </p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a>was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   I don't know.  I tried to ascertain according </p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a>to the Occurrence Book but there is no continuity to see when he </p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a>left, when he came back and where he was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a>ADV MOOSA:   So the Occurrence Book entries were not </p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a>particularly helpful?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   Not at that stage because I do no know where </p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a>we took him, I cannot remember anymore, there were also </p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a>occasions that I spoke to him in the cell.  So I cannot help you </p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a>any more than that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a>ADV MOOSA:   You have, of course, given evidence that other </p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a>documents were falsified including details of his re-detention is </p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a>that right?  That he was released and then arrested again.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   No, no ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a>ADV MOOSA:   Well not arrested, kidnapped.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   No, what I meant by that is that according to </p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a>me he had been released.  By implication he had been released in </p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a>the book.  I did not re-arrest him, I just never released him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a>ADV MOOSA:   But a detention under Section 6 of the then </p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a>Terrorism Act had certain implications regarding for example, </p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a>visits by magistrates and doctors, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a>ADV MOOSA:   To questions from the Chairman of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a>Committee you seem to indicate that you were not certain </p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a>whether these occurred or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   I don't know, I have no documentation in </p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a>front of me after all the years, and I dealt with a great many </p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a>detainees.  I cannot say whether they were examined by the </p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a>doctor or whether they spoke to a magistrate etc.  I do want to </p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a>go as far as to say that I do believe that he was visited by an </p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a>inspector for detainees, I don't know why I recall that, that such </p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a>a report from this inspector was submitted to the Harms </p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a>Commission.  I think that the inspector for detainees at that stage </p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a>was a Mr Koekemoer or it could have been van Zyl, I am not </p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a>sure.  There were two of them, and I think that such a report was </p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a>handed in, however I cannot recall this one a hundred percent, it </p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a>is possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a>ADV MOOSA:   It is of course so that Mr Kondile did complain </p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a>about being assaulted at one stage, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   Yes he did complain to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a>ADV MOOSA:   Wouldn't it have been the easiest thing in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a>world to have him actually medically treated if he was in fact not </p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a>assaulted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   I could have taken him to a doctor but he did </p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a>not insist, and at that stage the relationship between us was so </p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a>that he would have told me that he had pain and that he wanted to </p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a>go to the doctor, but he didn't.  In short I can just tell you that </p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a>he did not request to be taken to a doctor and nor did I take him, </p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a>as far as I can remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a>ADV MOOSA:   Having reached the conclusion after intensive </p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a>discussions with Mr van Rensburg and Erasmus that Kondile had </p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a>to be eliminated, what prevented you then from confronting him </p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a>with the note that you had found and discussing that with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   I suppose I could have done that but I did not </p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a>do it because I was satisfied that he had not yet sent out a </p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a>message in the first place and I did not want to make him </p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a>suspicious.</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a>ADV MOOSA:   But how would there be any danger from him, </p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a>he's now definitely going to be eliminated, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a>ADV MOOSA:   In this trip from Jeffrey's Bay through to Port </p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a>Elizabeth and from Port Elizabeth to Komatipoort was there much </p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a>discussion with Mr Kondile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   No, not as far as I can remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a>ADV MOOSA:   On the surface, however, the two of you still got </p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a>along very well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a>ADV MOOSA:   And ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   I was just suggesting to my client that perhaps </p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a>he should slow down with the interpretation.  I think we are </p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a>going to pick up problems once again.  I wasn't suggesting how </p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a>he should answer a question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a>ADV MOOSA:   Thanks.  If I got it correct from your evidence-</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a>in-chief you were in the car with Mr Kondile, is that right, on this </p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a>trip?</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a>ADV MOOSA:   Have you any idea whether he knew what he was </p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a>in for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   No he did not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a>ADV MOOSA:   Was there any reason given by any of you for the </p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a>trip that was undertaken?</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   I can speculate as to what we told him but I </p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a>cannot recall that we said anything pertinently.  It could be that </p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a>we said that we wanted to transfer him to other people who </p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a>wanted to ask him further questions.  I do not know, I cannot </p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a>recall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a>ADV MOOSA:   You have mentioned that it happened to be a </p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a>Sergeant Otto who shot Mr Kondile, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a>ADV MOOSA:   And Sergeant Otto happens to be a person who </p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a>committed suicide, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   At a later stage I heard that he had died.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a>don't know whether he committed suicide or what.  I saw him on </p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a>that day and not again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a>ADV MOOSA:   Were you introduced to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a>ADV MOOSA:   And by whom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   I am not sure, possibly he introduced himself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a>ADV MOOSA:   Mr Coetzee has been very clear that there were a </p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a>number of policemen who were there including Archie Flemington </p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a>and other people that he's mentioned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   I don't agree.  I want to tell you this about </p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a>Archie Flemington. I am certain in my heart that I saw Archie </p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a>Flemington for the first time during the Harms Commission in </p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a>Pretoria.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a>ADV MOOSA:   Mr Coetzee certainly doesn't mention an Otto but </p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a>he refers to a person he did not know, a slender person, who took </p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a>a gun, but that he says was Archie Flemington's gun, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a>ADV MOOSA:   And that gun was used to kill the deceased. </p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a>ADV MOOSA:   Thank you.  Now is it just mere coincidence that </p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a>you happened to choose a person who is now dead to have done </p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a>the killing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   Facts are facts your Honour, I can't wish </p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a>them away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a>ADV MOOSA:   Well I will put it to you that the fact is that in </p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a>comparing your versions Mr Coetzee's version is eminently more </p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a>probable, that in fact there were other policemen present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   There were other policemen, yes, we were </p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a>there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a>ADV MOOSA:   Yes, besides the group that you have spoken </p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a>about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   I don't know about that, definitely not what I </p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a>saw.</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a>ADV MOOSA:   Wouldn't it have been protocol for Mr Coetzee </p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a>to approach the person in charge in the Komatipoort area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   I don't think it was necessary.  Perhaps he </p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a>had contacted him, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a>ADV MOOSA:   When he came to the Eastern Cape he made it his </p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a>business to contact Mr van Rensburg, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   I can't comment on that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a>ADV MOOSA:   Tell me about the fire that was made, what was </p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a>used to make the fire?</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   It was dry sticks, some wood which was lying </p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a>around and we brought bigger pieces of wood together.  I am </p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a>referring only to myself here.  I am not sure whether diesel or </p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a>petrol was used, I can't remember distinctly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a>ADV MOOSA:   Whether it was diesel or petrol was it actually </p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a>taken by somebody to the scene ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   No I think there may be a misunderstanding.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a>The witness' answer was, he cannot recall whether there was </p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a>diesel or petrol.</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a>ADV MOOSA:   Yes, the question is, whatever it was that was </p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a>used to light the fire was it already taken by somebody else to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a>scene?</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   I think so.  I can't remember that we have </p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a>taken something with.  I can't say that diesel or something was </p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a>used there.  I can remember the wood, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a>ADV DE JAGER:   I think what the witness said, is he can't </p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a>remember whether anything was used, and not whether either </p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a>diesel or petrol was used.  His answer was, "I can't remember </p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a>whether anything was used".</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a>ADV MOOSA:   You were saying earlier that it was dry wood </p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a>that was used, could you give us the time when the process began </p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a>of gathering wood?  Plus/minus are we talking about afternoon or </p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a>evening, what time was it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   We came there during late that afternoon.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a>think the arrangement was that we would meet Mr Coetzee at six </p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a>o'clock.  I think we met him round about that time.  There already </p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a>had been gathered dry wood at that stage and we gathered some </p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a>more wood afterwards, more wood was gathered afterwards.</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a>ADV MOOSA:   So if I get you correctly this process started in </p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a>the afternoon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a>ADV MOOSA:   And did it go along all evening that more wood </p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a>was gathered and put on the burning fire?</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   That's correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a>ADV MOOSA:   Were no tyres used at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   Definitely not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a>ADV MOOSA:   You see I am again going to put it that the </p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a>version that Mr Coetzee gives of wood and tyres actually being </p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a>brought on the scene is far more probable than what you are </p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a>telling us now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   I don't agree.</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a>ADV MOOSA:   You have given some evidence of how this </p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a>incident affected you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a>ADV MOOSA:   I wonder if you've spared a thought at all for </p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a>how it's affected the family of Mr Kondile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   I realise that it must have been a bitter </p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a>experience for them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a>ADV MOOSA:   You have given a list which goes as many as ten </p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a>points and you still refer to other documents after that which are </p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a>supposed to define the political object that you sought to achieve, </p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a>is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a>ADV MOOSA:   I put it to you that if we go one by one through </p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a>your list we will find that nothing will justify the murder and the </p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a>callous and inhuman way in which Mr Kondile was treated by you </p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a>and the others to justify any political objective.</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   I realise that it is difficult for any person to </p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a>accept that, but the other side of the story is also true.  We </p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a>received the same treatment from the ANC.  They had a task </p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a>which they had to fulfil, I also had a task which I had to do, just </p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a>like they believed I also believed that I was doing the right thing. </p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a> Nine out of ten cases, all of us were wrong and the politicians </p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a>did not do their jobs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a>ADV MOOSA:   Well very good, but there is something called </p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a>proportionality and whether it's from the ANC and whether it's </p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a>from you, once you exceed that line we can't talk of politics </p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a>anymore.</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   Definitely yes, I believed in any case that I </p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a>did all that in the interests of the politics and of my country to do </p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a>that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a>ADV MOOSA:   I don't think you understood me.  There is a </p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a>point we reach, even in terms of the Act in terms of which you </p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a>are applying for amnesty where we cannot even begin to talk </p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a>about politics because you've crossed the line.</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   I realise that, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a>ADV MOOSA:   As far as the family of Sizwe Kondile is </p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a>concerned Mr du Plessis, you certainly crossed the line.</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   I am sorry to hear that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a>ADV MOOSA:   And perhaps it would be best if I put it in my </p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a>client's own words, Mrs Kondile actually feels that people like </p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a>you ought not to be free in a civilised society.</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   I have no comment regarding that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY ADV MOOSA</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a>CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR NYOKA:   Thank you Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a>Chairman.  Good afternoon Mr du Plessis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   Good afternoon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a>MR NYOKA:   You basically considered two options before you </p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a>decided to kill Mr Kondile, namely to detain him further or to </p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a>charge him, those are the only options that you considered, is that </p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a>correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   That is all that I can think of.</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a>MR NYOKA:   You must have been very experienced as a security </p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a>officer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   Yes I had good experience.</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a>MR NYOKA:   Why did you not consider the following options - </p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a>firstly, testing his loyalty by giving him false information about </p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a>your informers or principal agent just to test what his direction </p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a>was going to be before trusting within only two week or three </p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a>weeks, why did you not do that?  Maybe that would have averted </p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a>his death.</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   Well in the first instance I did not do that.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a>That's point number one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a>	Secondly, if I provided him with false information regarding </p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a>a principal agent I would caused somebody else's death.</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a>MR NYOKA:   And you said that you have belief in the Western </p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a>style of democracy, and one of the basis of detaining and </p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a>interrogating a person is a criminal prosecution, why did you not </p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a>pursue that line of criminal prosecution?</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   Your Honour I don't know what you are </p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a>referring to or actually what you are asking.  If I had done that </p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a>the agent and the network would have been exposed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a>MR NYOKA:   I am saying that as a State employee you owe your </p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a>allegiance to obeying the laws of the country and you said in your </p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a>background that you believed in the Western democratic lifestyle, </p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a>why was that not your main focus of criminally prosecuting this </p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a>person, other than killing, death?</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   The fact is initially I started to charge him </p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a>but later on I saw that he was more valuable to be used as an </p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a>informer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a>MR NYOKA:   Did you regard it as your fault that he did, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a>alleged turnabout, did you regard it as your fault?</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a>MR NYOKA:   If then it was not your fault why then did you not </p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a>refer your problem further on in the command structure for better </p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a>alternatives or suggestions, because it was not your fault that he </p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a>turned-about, why did you not refer it further?</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   Your Honour I did what I felt was necessary. </p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a> I don't think one can do much.  This is how it happened.  We can </p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a>speculate for a whole week.</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a>MR NYOKA:   No I am not speculating.  Specifically I am saying </p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a>that why did you not refer this to the Regional Commissioner of </p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a>the South African Police, firstly;  secondly, to the National </p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a>Commissioner of the South African Police, and thirdly, to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a>Minister of Law and Order for better solutions, why did you not </p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a>do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   I approached General Erasmus and he </p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a>provided a solution at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a>MR NYOKA:   If you felt like not criminally prosecuting the </p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a>deceased, despite the clear evidence in front of you rather than </p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a>kill him, why could not have killed him politically by causing him </p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a>to agree on tape for working for you and then sending the tape </p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a>indirectly, or directly, to the ANC in Lesotho.  He will not have </p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a>been believed with whatever information he brought?</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   We know this does not work.</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a>MR NYOKA:   Did you consider it?  It doesn't matter whether it </p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a>viable or not, did you consider it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   No I never considered that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a>MR NYOKA:   And if you had simply released Mr Kondile he </p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a>came with an ANC person's motor vehicle for a short period, </p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a>allegedly without accomplishing the mission that he came for and </p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a>gone back unscathed, do you think that the ANC would still have </p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a>been suspicious about him even if you had released him on the </p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a>basis that you had no evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   When?</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a>MR NYOKA:   Rather than killing him, just releasing him back to </p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a>Lesotho.</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   I know which information he had access to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a>MR NYOKA:   My point is that you would not have been believed </p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a>because, precisely because of the fact that he came for a short </p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a>period with Mr Chris Hani's car but nothing happened to him.  He </p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a>didn't even accomplish his mission ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   They would have believed him, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a>MR NYOKA:   So now you are speculating yourself now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   This is the only speculation and the only </p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a>inference I can draw, and it's not the first time that this </p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a>happened, many people were murdered like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a>MR NYOKA:   And you said the deceased's main area of </p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a>operation was Transkei, which according to the laws of South </p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a>Africa was an independent state, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a>MR NYOKA:   You could not have dealt with the so-called </p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a>Kondile problem with the Transkei authorities and then denying </p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a>that you ever dealt with him and causing them to interrogate him, </p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a>prosecute him and pursue further investigation, could you not </p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a>have done that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   No, you could do anything but the fact </p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a>remained he had all the information available.</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a>MR NYOKA:   You were involved in a similar abduction and </p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a>murder of two Port Elizabeth activists, Mthimkulu and Madaka, </p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a>not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   That's correct.   </p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a>MR NYOKA:   Eight months later ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a>MR NYOKA:   In April 1982.  They were also similarly supplied </p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a>with a knockout mixture shot and burnt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a>MR NYOKA:   And their bodies were thrown at the Tele Bridge </p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a>next to Lesotho.  Similar modus operandi.  Sorry at Fish River </p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a>Sun, their car was left at the Tele Bridge, next to the Tele </p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a>Bridge, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   That's correct, ja.</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a>MR NYOKA:   This operation under consideration like the </p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a>Mthimkulu and Madaka one, why is that local Security policemen </p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a>were not used like in Mthimkulu and Madaka?  Why do you have </p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a>to ask Mr Dirk Coetzee to be involved for instance?</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   Well we perhaps have learnt from Mr Coetzee </p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a>how to do it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a>MR NYOKA:   Maybe because he was going to be the supplier or </p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a>facilitator of knockout drops from Mr Lothar Neethling.</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   No I don't know about knockout drops.</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a>MR NYOKA:   In the Mthimkulu and Madaka matter it was only </p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a>you and Mr van Rensburg and Mr Nieuwoudt who were involved?</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a>MR NYOKA:   That is for two people, that is Mthimkulu and </p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a>Madaka, but in this one there were five involved.  What role was </p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a>envisaged for each of the five people in the Kondile matter, what </p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a>role was envisaged exactly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Are you asking what role was envisaged or </p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a>what role did they in fact play?</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a>(The speakers mike is not on)</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a>MR NYOKA:   What role did they play, what role was envisaged </p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a>to be played by each of them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   I can't comment on that. We were three </p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a>people because the vehicle, Kondile's vehicle, had to be taken </p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a>from Bloemfontein to the border.</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a>MR NYOKA:   Was it not because you wanted to create a festive </p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a>atmosphere in celebration of averting another Biko scandal and </p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a>that you wanted to gain experience?</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   Definitely not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a>MR NYOKA:   Do you know of any reason why Mr Danster will </p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a>say that you assaulted the deceased if that was not the case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   I don't know ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a>ADV DE JAGER:   But it's right he did assault the deceased.</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a>MR NYOKA:   I am mentioning the specific acts Your Worship </p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a>like electric shocks etc, etc, not only those that the applicant </p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a>mentioned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a>	Do you know of any reason why he mentioned the specific </p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a>acts of assault and mentioned the people that were involved </p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a>including some that were not applicants if that is not the case, </p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a>including himself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   I don't know.  It could be that he is making a </p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a>big mistake, that he is thinking of somebody completely different.</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a>MR NYOKA:   What is strange to me is that you concede - Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a>Nieuwoudt, Mr Roelofse and the late Mr Buzane were included by </p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a>him, including himself, as people who assaulted the deceased, you </p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a>deny that they were involved, it's not because they are not </p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a>applicants?</p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   No, I deny that they were involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a>MR NYOKA:   Sorry Worship I am reminded it's tea time by the </p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a>evidence leader.</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   ...(indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a>MR NYOKA:   At one stage there are two periods of detention </p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a>and interrogation - there is the one between the 10th of July to </p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a>the 24th, that is Humansdorp.  And then the second one from the </p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a>24th of July to some time towards the end of July, beginning of </p>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a>August, at which of the two stages did he start to cooperate, Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a>du Plessis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   He already started co-operating in </p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a>Humansdorp.</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a>MR NYOKA:   And when did you make the offer to recruit him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   I don't know, I can't remember whether it was </p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a>Humansdorp or Jeffrey's Bay, I can't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a>MR NYOKA:   And can you tell us why he was conveniently </p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a>detained in relatively remote areas like Jeffrey's Bay or </p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a>Humansdorp which were 70 to 60 kilometres from PE where most </p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a>of you are based?</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   In the first instance Your Honour there was a </p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a>principled decision that he should be detained in safe cells and </p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a>that we found at Jeffrey's Bay.  Jeffrey's Bay was qualified to </p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a>keep these people.  We did not have many of those secure cells </p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a>and there was another one at Algoa Park and also Louis Le </p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a>Grange Plein, that was the one thing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a>	And there is nothing else that I can think of now why we </p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a>could not detain him there.  We could have kept him in the police </p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a>cells.  It could have been that the other police stations were full. </p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a> We had problems with Algoa Park because information was </p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a>leaked from there.  I am speculating about that, but that was the </p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a>reason why they were detained there.  We were detaining a lot of </p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a>people at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a>MR NYOKA:   Was it not because also that you do not want to be </p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a>disturbed in assaulting him and torturing him hence a remote area </p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a>like those places?</p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   Your Honour Jeffrey's Bay is not a very </p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a>remote place, Humansdorp neither.</p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Tortures have known to have taken place in </p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a>huge cities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a>MR NYOKA:   On the informer theory do you agree with me that </p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a>Mr Danster had nothing to gain by saying that Mr Kondile refused </p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a>to be an informer, despite the beatings?  As he added that he also </p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a>later on co-operated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   I don't know what Mr Danster's agenda is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a>MR NYOKA:   I don't hold any brief for him either.  If at first </p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a>you had to assault Mr Kondile and he refused to divulge certain </p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a>information surely you must have been on guard not to trust him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   No, no, no, no, let us understand one another </p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a>well.  There are people today in the government who was very </p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a>difficult to cooperate with us and today they are still loyal.  It's </p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a>not to say that if you cooperate right from the beginning you can </p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a>trust a person.  It could also be vice versa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a>MR NYOKA:   And when he had agreed to be an informer he was </p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a>still in detention, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a>MR NYOKA:   And when you gave him a full briefing on the </p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a>security network he was still in detention?</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a>MR NYOKA:   Why was he still in detention if at all he had been </p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a>asked and agreed to be an informer and on top of that he was so </p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a>trusted to be furnished with such vital information, why was he </p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a>still in detention?</p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   Well he was kept in detention, that was the </p>
<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a>decision and I can't comment on that now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   I think this ground has been covered already, </p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a>has it not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a>MR NYOKA:   Who was this unknown person to whom this note </p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a>was addressed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   I can't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a>MR NYOKA:   You did not follow it up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   No, I could possibly have followed it up but </p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a>how?</p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a>MR NYOKA:   If Mr Kondile was still in detention how would he </p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a>have managed to send the message out to this person if he didn't </p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a>even - were able to follow it up?  How was he going to be able to </p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a>let the message go out to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   No I never said that, I could not follow it up, </p>
<p class="line" id="line546"><a name="pos546"></a>I said I did not do it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a>MR NYOKA:   And this note, what was it, was it a paper or two </p>
<p class="line" id="line548"><a name="pos548"></a>papers or what, this note that you found underneath his blanket?</p>
<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   No it was not a long note, it was a short little </p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a>note on which the information was written.  I don't want to </p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a>speculate.  It was a part of a page.  It was written in small </p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a>handwriting.  This was among the other papers he had there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a>MR NYOKA:   So there were other papers underneath the </p>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a>blanket?</p>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   Yes those were notes he addressed to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a>MR NYOKA:   Why did you not confront him about this and say </p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a>Mr Kondile what are you doing to me now?  What are you doing </p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a>to me now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   I did not do it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a>MR NYOKA:   Why not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   I told you I did not know what I could expect </p>
<p class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a>at that stage, I did not know how to handle that and that is why I </p>
<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a>approached a senior officer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a>MR NYOKA:   At Bloemfontein why was the car not kept at the </p>
<p class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a>police station?</p>
<p class="line" id="line566"><a name="pos566"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   As far as I can remember it was pertinently </p>
<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a>not kept there because Hani at certain stages or at various </p>
<p class="line" id="line568"><a name="pos568"></a>instances he or some of his agents visited Bloemfontein and he </p>
<p class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a>could have had contact at the police stations.  That's why we </p>
<p class="line" id="line570"><a name="pos570"></a>decided not to keep the vehicle there, and this is what I can </p>
<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a>remember now.  It might not have been the specific reason but </p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a>that is what I remember now.  I can't tell you exactly where the </p>
<p class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a>vehicle was kept either but it was somewhere in Bloemfontein.</p>
<p class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a>MR NYOKA:   You said that your intention was to leave both the </p>
<p class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a>bodies and the car visible so that the car could be found that Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a>Kondile was trying to skip the country and the body found on the </p>
<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a>other side of the border of Mozambique not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a>MR NYOKA:   Do you agree with me that the Barberton area was </p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a>nearest to the Swaziland border rather than the Mozambique </p>
<p class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a>border?</p>
<p class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   I don't know that area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a>MR NYOKA:   I've got a map if you want to see it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   I accept what you say.  I did not decide to </p>
<p class="line" id="line585"><a name="pos585"></a>leave the vehicle there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line586"><a name="pos586"></a>MR NYOKA:   Do you further agree with me that had you gone </p>
<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a>on with the plan of not burning Mr Kondile the car would have </p>
<p class="line" id="line588"><a name="pos588"></a>been next to Swaziland and the body in Mozambique, there would </p>
<p class="line" id="line589"><a name="pos589"></a>have been no logic for the body and the car to be in such different </p>
<p class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a>places, do you agree with me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a>MR NYOKA:   And how is it that the vehicle was never found </p>
<p class="line" id="line593"><a name="pos593"></a>despite the fact that it was left in such an area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line594"><a name="pos594"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a>MR NYOKA:   And your team was in charge of the operation and </p>
<p class="line" id="line596"><a name="pos596"></a>the task team, why do you have to be persuaded by Mr Dirk </p>
<p class="line" id="line597"><a name="pos597"></a>Coetzee to change your plans of leaving the body on the other </p>
<p class="line" id="line598"><a name="pos598"></a>side of the border?</p>
<p class="line" id="line599"><a name="pos599"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   Ag Your Honour I don't want to speculate </p>
<p class="line" id="line600"><a name="pos600"></a>about that.  This was a discussion which took place between him </p>
<p class="line" id="line601"><a name="pos601"></a>and van Rensburg and I just abide by that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line602"><a name="pos602"></a>MR NYOKA:   I put it to you that you knew all along how you </p>
<p class="line" id="line603"><a name="pos603"></a>were going to kill Mr Kondile.  That you were going to supply </p>
<p class="line" id="line604"><a name="pos604"></a>him with knockout drops or sleeping mixture, kill him and burn </p>
<p class="line" id="line605"><a name="pos605"></a>him.  You are ascribing to him because he came forward publicly </p>
<p class="line" id="line606"><a name="pos606"></a>to the world in 1989, out of bitterness you are ascribing that to </p>
<p class="line" id="line607"><a name="pos607"></a>him, any comment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line608"><a name="pos608"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   I planned, I was part of the plan to kill this </p>
<p class="line" id="line609"><a name="pos609"></a>person but definitely not with the so-called knockout drops, or to </p>
<p class="line" id="line610"><a name="pos610"></a>burn him.  I did not have any knowledge of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line611"><a name="pos611"></a>MR NYOKA:   The place that was selected for the killing was a </p>
<p class="line" id="line612"><a name="pos612"></a>remote one so that it could not be seen, you also could not be </p>
<p class="line" id="line613"><a name="pos613"></a>seen, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line614"><a name="pos614"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   Yes that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line615"><a name="pos615"></a>MR NYOKA:   What steps did you take to ensure that you were </p>
<p class="line" id="line616"><a name="pos616"></a>not seen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line617"><a name="pos617"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   Well we were always present ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line618"><a name="pos618"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Is that really pertinent now, because the event </p>
<p class="line" id="line619"><a name="pos619"></a>has occurred, he was killed, what purpose is there to ask </p>
<p class="line" id="line620"><a name="pos620"></a>questions like this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line621"><a name="pos621"></a>MR NYOKA:   My learned friend there are two purposes.  The </p>
<p class="line" id="line622"><a name="pos622"></a>first one is that I did not hear the witness saying that the </p>
<p class="line" id="line623"><a name="pos623"></a>cartridge was taken after the shot was fired.  Secondly, I did not </p>
<p class="line" id="line624"><a name="pos624"></a>hear him saying that the blood was cleared so that </p>
<p class="line" id="line625"><a name="pos625"></a>...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line626"><a name="pos626"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   He hasn't been questioned about the cartridge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line627"><a name="pos627"></a>MR NYOKA:   I was going to that Your Worship but you cut me, </p>
<p class="line" id="line628"><a name="pos628"></a>I was going to ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line629"><a name="pos629"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   No I thought you were talking about the </p>
<p class="line" id="line630"><a name="pos630"></a>position where the execution took place ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line631"><a name="pos631"></a>MR NYOKA:   No I was wrapping up, I was coming to that Your </p>
<p class="line" id="line632"><a name="pos632"></a>Worship ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line633"><a name="pos633"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Well come to that please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line634"><a name="pos634"></a>MR NYOKA:   The cartridge, did anyone take the cartridge away?</p>
<p class="line" id="line635"><a name="pos635"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   I can't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line636"><a name="pos636"></a>MR NYOKA:   Did you clear the blood at the spot where he was </p>
<p class="line" id="line637"><a name="pos637"></a>shot before he was placed on the pyre?</p>
<p class="line" id="line638"><a name="pos638"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   I think it was done, I did not do it personally.</p>
<p class="line" id="line639"><a name="pos639"></a>MR NYOKA:   But you don't know for a fact whether it was </p>
<p class="line" id="line640"><a name="pos640"></a>done?</p>
<p class="line" id="line641"><a name="pos641"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   No I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line642"><a name="pos642"></a>MR NYOKA:   You say that the body was completely burnt to </p>
<p class="line" id="line643"><a name="pos643"></a>ashes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line644"><a name="pos644"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line645"><a name="pos645"></a>MR NYOKA:   Without tyres being used?</p>
<p class="line" id="line646"><a name="pos646"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   That's my recollection, ja.</p>
<p class="line" id="line647"><a name="pos647"></a>MR NYOKA:   Bones did not remain?</p>
<p class="line" id="line648"><a name="pos648"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   I can't remember that anything was left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line649"><a name="pos649"></a>MR NYOKA:   We have expert evidence that if a body is burnt </p>
<p class="line" id="line650"><a name="pos650"></a>bones will remain and if bones do remain and they were thrown </p>
<p class="line" id="line651"><a name="pos651"></a>wherever they should still be there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line652"><a name="pos652"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   I can't help you in that respect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line653"><a name="pos653"></a>MR NYOKA:   Finally Mr du Plessis your affidavit in response in </p>
<p class="line" id="line654"><a name="pos654"></a>response to Mr Coetzee's averments I think through the Harms </p>
<p class="line" id="line655"><a name="pos655"></a>Commission you said that briefly Mr Kondile co-operated, why </p>
<p class="line" id="line656"><a name="pos656"></a>did you not go further and say that he was an informer and we </p>
<p class="line" id="line657"><a name="pos657"></a>furnished him with information, that is why he may have </p>
<p class="line" id="line658"><a name="pos658"></a>absconded, that wouldn't have done your case down, it will have </p>
<p class="line" id="line659"><a name="pos659"></a>strengthened your claim that Mr Kondile absconded? Why did you </p>
<p class="line" id="line660"><a name="pos660"></a>not add that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line661"><a name="pos661"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   I don't know Your Honour.  This is what is in </p>
<p class="line" id="line662"><a name="pos662"></a>my statement, I can't even remember what is there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line663"><a name="pos663"></a>MR NYOKA:   And it was under oath that you said that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line664"><a name="pos664"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line665"><a name="pos665"></a>MR NYOKA:   And today you are also under oath?</p>
<p class="line" id="line666"><a name="pos666"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line667"><a name="pos667"></a>MR NYOKA:   Why do you think you should be believed now </p>
<p class="line" id="line668"><a name="pos668"></a>when you lied then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line669"><a name="pos669"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   No, in the first place I came to the fore.</p>
<p class="line" id="line670"><a name="pos670"></a>MR NYOKA:   From 28th of April 1994 to November 1996 after </p>
<p class="line" id="line671"><a name="pos671"></a>you had resigned from the SAP in 1993 and after the National </p>
<p class="line" id="line672"><a name="pos672"></a>Party Government was no longer in power, that is for two years </p>
<p class="line" id="line673"><a name="pos673"></a>before you applied, why did you not come forward with the truth </p>
<p class="line" id="line674"><a name="pos674"></a>if you are so remorseful?</p>
<p class="line" id="line675"><a name="pos675"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   I've said previously that the opportunity was </p>
<p class="line" id="line676"><a name="pos676"></a>created by this Committee and I've said it earlier that initially we </p>
<p class="line" id="line677"><a name="pos677"></a>did not trust this Commission and we were influenced by, for </p>
<p class="line" id="line678"><a name="pos678"></a>example, Colonel Erasmus and we came to the fore, and I am not </p>
<p class="line" id="line679"><a name="pos679"></a>sorry about that today.</p>
<p class="line" id="line680"><a name="pos680"></a>MR NYOKA:   And if you say you had eternal pain after that </p>
<p class="line" id="line681"><a name="pos681"></a>incident why did you jump from one murder to another within </p>
<p class="line" id="line682"><a name="pos682"></a>eight months or nine months from Kondile to Mthimkulu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line683"><a name="pos683"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   What I refer to is that I am still suffering this </p>
<p class="line" id="line684"><a name="pos684"></a>pain.  A job had to be done and there is nothing you can do about </p>
<p class="line" id="line685"><a name="pos685"></a>that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line686"><a name="pos686"></a>MR NYOKA:   My instructions from my client is that you have </p>
<p class="line" id="line687"><a name="pos687"></a>robbed him of a role model and a father and you have not told the </p>
<p class="line" id="line688"><a name="pos688"></a>truth today, the son, Bantu, the son of the deceased.  You have </p>
<p class="line" id="line689"><a name="pos689"></a>robbed him of a role model and a father and you have not told us </p>
<p class="line" id="line690"><a name="pos690"></a>the whole truth today, any comment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line691"><a name="pos691"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   I am very sorry that this happened, but the </p>
<p class="line" id="line692"><a name="pos692"></a>fact that I am sitting here today I can assure you that I am telling </p>
<p class="line" id="line693"><a name="pos693"></a>the truth and I am telling what I can remember and what I know </p>
<p class="line" id="line694"><a name="pos694"></a>of.</p>
<p class="line" id="line695"><a name="pos695"></a>MR NYOKA:   In conclusion have you approached him to </p>
<p class="line" id="line696"><a name="pos696"></a>apologise personally, he's a young man?</p>
<p class="line" id="line697"><a name="pos697"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   I have not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line698"><a name="pos698"></a>MR NYOKA:   Why not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line699"><a name="pos699"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   I did not do that because my legal counsel </p>
<p class="line" id="line700"><a name="pos700"></a>told me not to do that at this stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line701"><a name="pos701"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR NYOKA</p>
<p class="line" id="line702"><a name="pos702"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Are there any questions you wish to put to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line703"><a name="pos703"></a>applicant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line704"><a name="pos704"></a>ADV STEENKAMP:   Mr Chairman just two or three questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line705"><a name="pos705"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line706"><a name="pos706"></a>ADV STEENKAMP:   Thank you Sir.  The question I want to put </p>
<p class="line" id="line707"><a name="pos707"></a>to you which I do not understand, you were in control of this </p>
<p class="line" id="line708"><a name="pos708"></a>investigation from the start, you went out of your way with </p>
<p class="line" id="line709"><a name="pos709"></a>thorough planning to cover up the matter.  Nine years after this in </p>
<p class="line" id="line710"><a name="pos710"></a>1990 you told lies to the Harms Commission, what I find </p>
<p class="line" id="line711"><a name="pos711"></a>interesting is that all the applicants have filled in the same </p>
<p class="line" id="line712"><a name="pos712"></a>application once again, what is the possibility that by means - we </p>
<p class="line" id="line713"><a name="pos713"></a>have the possibility again that you can mislead the Truth </p>
<p class="line" id="line714"><a name="pos714"></a>Commission again.  The same modus operandi that you used with </p>
<p class="line" id="line715"><a name="pos715"></a>the Harms Commission as well as with the initial investigation.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line716"><a name="pos716"></a>The fact that you are leaving out certain important information, </p>
<p class="line" id="line717"><a name="pos717"></a>you left out the name Danster from your amnesty application.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line718"><a name="pos718"></a>The fact that this person was assaulted it's not even mentioned, </p>
<p class="line" id="line719"><a name="pos719"></a>can you comment on this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line720"><a name="pos720"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Can you - you make a long statement and now </p>
<p class="line" id="line721"><a name="pos721"></a>you are asking him to comment on all the points that you've made </p>
<p class="line" id="line722"><a name="pos722"></a>in that statement ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line723"><a name="pos723"></a>ADV STEENKAMP:   I'll break it down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line724"><a name="pos724"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   What about be a little more specific and put </p>
<p class="line" id="line725"><a name="pos725"></a>them one by one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line726"><a name="pos726"></a>ADV STEENKAMP:   Right Mr Chairman.  My question to him is </p>
<p class="line" id="line727"><a name="pos727"></a>the following.  It seems to me that when it came to filling in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line728"><a name="pos728"></a>amnesty applications which appear to me to be duplicates, that </p>
<p class="line" id="line729"><a name="pos729"></a>the same modus operandi was followed, as you did in the Harms </p>
<p class="line" id="line730"><a name="pos730"></a>Commission as well as during the investigation of the matter.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line731"><a name="pos731"></a>ADV DE JAGER:   Let him just reply to the one first as you </p>
<p class="line" id="line732"><a name="pos732"></a>asked him.  The question to you is that you misled the Harms </p>
<p class="line" id="line733"><a name="pos733"></a>Commission, you are now following the same modus operandi in </p>
<p class="line" id="line734"><a name="pos734"></a>this case.  What is your comment on this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line735"><a name="pos735"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   I can just deny it.  I am now speaking the </p>
<p class="line" id="line736"><a name="pos736"></a>truth.  I do not believe that one makes these mistakes more than </p>
<p class="line" id="line737"><a name="pos737"></a>once.</p>
<p class="line" id="line738"><a name="pos738"></a>ADV STEENKAMP:   The question I want to put to you is that </p>
<p class="line" id="line739"><a name="pos739"></a>Danster and Coetzee both say the deceased was badly assaulted.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line740"><a name="pos740"></a>Can you give any reason as to why they would say that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line741"><a name="pos741"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   With respect on that question regarding Dirk </p>
<p class="line" id="line742"><a name="pos742"></a>Coetzee, where does Dirk Coetzee say that? If my learned friend </p>
<p class="line" id="line743"><a name="pos743"></a>can just point out where he said that the deceased was assaulted </p>
<p class="line" id="line744"><a name="pos744"></a>seriously otherwise I must object.  His evidence was that General </p>
<p class="line" id="line745"><a name="pos745"></a>van Rensburg told him that the man jumped through the window </p>
<p class="line" id="line746"><a name="pos746"></a>and landed on his head during interrogation.  I cannot recall him </p>
<p class="line" id="line747"><a name="pos747"></a>saying that he was seriously assaulted.  Dirk alleges that he only </p>
<p class="line" id="line748"><a name="pos748"></a>saw him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line749"><a name="pos749"></a>ADV STEENKAMP:   Good.  Can I then ask you, is there any </p>
<p class="line" id="line750"><a name="pos750"></a>reason why a person such as Danster will lie about this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line751"><a name="pos751"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   Lie about what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line752"><a name="pos752"></a>ADV STEENKAMP:   That Kondile was assaulted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line753"><a name="pos753"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   But I said that he was assaulted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line754"><a name="pos754"></a>ADV STEENKAMP:   That you assaulted him seriously, why </p>
<p class="line" id="line755"><a name="pos755"></a>would he lie about this, can you give a reason?</p>
<p class="line" id="line756"><a name="pos756"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   No I acknowledge that I assaulted him </p>
<p class="line" id="line757"><a name="pos757"></a>...(intervention)  Can I just reply please, can you just give me a </p>
<p class="line" id="line758"><a name="pos758"></a>chance to reply.</p>
<p class="line" id="line759"><a name="pos759"></a>	I am saying that I did assault him.  I know of no case where </p>
<p class="line" id="line760"><a name="pos760"></a>Danster was present during his interrogation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line761"><a name="pos761"></a>ADV STEENKAMP:   Do you know a person by the name of </p>
<p class="line" id="line762"><a name="pos762"></a>Sergeant N N Batsane, the person who is mentioned by Danster, </p>
<p class="line" id="line763"><a name="pos763"></a>was he ever present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line764"><a name="pos764"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   It's most probably Bezane, he died quite a </p>
<p class="line" id="line765"><a name="pos765"></a>few years ago, I think it's '81 or '82.</p>
<p class="line" id="line766"><a name="pos766"></a>ADV STEENKAMP:   Was he ever present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line767"><a name="pos767"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   No he was not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line768"><a name="pos768"></a>ADV STEENKAMP:   Did he ever refer to the deceased as </p>
<p class="line" id="line769"><a name="pos769"></a>Kwezi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line770"><a name="pos770"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   No, not as far as I know.  I called him by the </p>
<p class="line" id="line771"><a name="pos771"></a>name of Kondile.</p>
<p class="line" id="line772"><a name="pos772"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY ADV STEENKAMP</p>
<p class="line" id="line773"><a name="pos773"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   How well did you know this man Danster?</p>
<p class="line" id="line774"><a name="pos774"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   It's very difficult.  I do not know how long </p>
<p class="line" id="line775"><a name="pos775"></a>he had been with the Security Branch at that stage so it's difficult </p>
<p class="line" id="line776"><a name="pos776"></a>for me to say as to whether I knew him for a year or two years.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line777"><a name="pos777"></a>knew him quite well, he worked under me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line778"><a name="pos778"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   During the time that you had Kondile under </p>
<p class="line" id="line779"><a name="pos779"></a>interrogation was Danster at the same police station or the same </p>
<p class="line" id="line780"><a name="pos780"></a>unit that you were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line781"><a name="pos781"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line782"><a name="pos782"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Danster knew that Kondile was being </p>
<p class="line" id="line783"><a name="pos783"></a>interrogated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line784"><a name="pos784"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   I do not think that he knew, I think it's a case </p>
<p class="line" id="line785"><a name="pos785"></a>of him hearing a bit, and at a later stage he was used by myself </p>
<p class="line" id="line786"><a name="pos786"></a>and Mr Raath in the single quarters at Jeffrey's Bay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line787"><a name="pos787"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   You've no doubt read the statement made by </p>
<p class="line" id="line788"><a name="pos788"></a>Mr Danster?</p>
<p class="line" id="line789"><a name="pos789"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line790"><a name="pos790"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Among other things he says "there were </p>
<p class="line" id="line791"><a name="pos791"></a>occasions when Kondile was kept without sleep for several nights, </p>
<p class="line" id="line792"><a name="pos792"></a>his torture would extend for days", have you anything to say </p>
<p class="line" id="line793"><a name="pos793"></a>about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line794"><a name="pos794"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   I can deny this categorically, really.</p>
<p class="line" id="line795"><a name="pos795"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   He also says, among other things, that Kondile </p>
<p class="line" id="line796"><a name="pos796"></a>was suffocated with a tube, an electric shock was administered to </p>
<p class="line" id="line797"><a name="pos797"></a>him for lengthy periods.</p>
<p class="line" id="line798"><a name="pos798"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   I deny that.  I can only speak for myself.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line799"><a name="pos799"></a>have no knowledge of this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line800"><a name="pos800"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   He doesn't say that you applied electric shock </p>
<p class="line" id="line801"><a name="pos801"></a>to him, he says that this was what was done to Kondile and all </p>
<p class="line" id="line802"><a name="pos802"></a>you are saying is you don't know about it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line803"><a name="pos803"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   I do not know about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line804"><a name="pos804"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   That might have been done by somebody else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line805"><a name="pos805"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   If that had happened I believe that he would </p>
<p class="line" id="line806"><a name="pos806"></a>have complained in the first place.  In the second place one would </p>
<p class="line" id="line807"><a name="pos807"></a>have seen the scars.  That is what I would like to believe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line808"><a name="pos808"></a>ADV DE JAGER:   Were those methods not followed exactly for </p>
<p class="line" id="line809"><a name="pos809"></a>that reason so that there were to be no scars?</p>
<p class="line" id="line810"><a name="pos810"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   I do not know if one is assaulted so seriously </p>
<p class="line" id="line811"><a name="pos811"></a>or suffocated with tubes then I think there would have been scars.</p>
<p class="line" id="line812"><a name="pos812"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   If one is kept without sleep for long periods of </p>
<p class="line" id="line813"><a name="pos813"></a>time during interrogation then there would be no scars.</p>
<p class="line" id="line814"><a name="pos814"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   That is correct but I would have realised </p>
<p class="line" id="line815"><a name="pos815"></a>that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line816"><a name="pos816"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   How?</p>
<p class="line" id="line817"><a name="pos817"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   By seeing that he was sleepy and exhausted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line818"><a name="pos818"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  That means only that you were there at </p>
<p class="line" id="line819"><a name="pos819"></a>the time.  I understand you were not 24 hours a day with Kondile.</p>
<p class="line" id="line820"><a name="pos820"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line821"><a name="pos821"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   In your absence this might have been done to </p>
<p class="line" id="line822"><a name="pos822"></a>him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line823"><a name="pos823"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   Yes I think that anything is always possible, </p>
<p class="line" id="line824"><a name="pos824"></a>but I have no knowledge of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line825"><a name="pos825"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   You have heard of people being kept awake </p>
<p class="line" id="line826"><a name="pos826"></a>for long periods of time during interrogation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line827"><a name="pos827"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line828"><a name="pos828"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   So that's not such a strange thought?</p>
<p class="line" id="line829"><a name="pos829"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   That's correct.  I also want to tell you that I </p>
<p class="line" id="line830"><a name="pos830"></a>do not know why, why in this case it would have been necessary.</p>
<p class="line" id="line831"><a name="pos831"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   It may be necessary because they were seeking </p>
<p class="line" id="line832"><a name="pos832"></a>to extract information from him and he was apparently not willing </p>
<p class="line" id="line833"><a name="pos833"></a>to give that information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line834"><a name="pos834"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   I must differ there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line835"><a name="pos835"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   There can be no other reason why this was </p>
<p class="line" id="line836"><a name="pos836"></a>done.  I mean if he was very, very willing in giving information </p>
<p class="line" id="line837"><a name="pos837"></a>there would be no need for anybody to do that, to keep the man </p>
<p class="line" id="line838"><a name="pos838"></a>awake for several hours.</p>
<p class="line" id="line839"><a name="pos839"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   That's why I am denying this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line840"><a name="pos840"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Well you are denying that you did it, and I am </p>
<p class="line" id="line841"><a name="pos841"></a>putting it to you that there is a possibility that that was done </p>
<p class="line" id="line842"><a name="pos842"></a>because you weren't there 24 hours a day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line843"><a name="pos843"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   That's correct but I am telling you that it </p>
<p class="line" id="line844"><a name="pos844"></a>might be possible but it is highly improbable that a person whom I </p>
<p class="line" id="line845"><a name="pos845"></a>was satisfied had given the information would have been treated </p>
<p class="line" id="line846"><a name="pos846"></a>in this way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line847"><a name="pos847"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   May this not have been done before he gave </p>
<p class="line" id="line848"><a name="pos848"></a>the information?</p>
<p class="line" id="line849"><a name="pos849"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line850"><a name="pos850"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   There was no point in doing this when he had </p>
<p class="line" id="line851"><a name="pos851"></a>already given information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line852"><a name="pos852"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line853"><a name="pos853"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   So when it's suggested that this was done it </p>
<p class="line" id="line854"><a name="pos854"></a>could only be before he volunteered information if he did </p>
<p class="line" id="line855"><a name="pos855"></a>volunteer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line856"><a name="pos856"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   He started in Bloemfontein by giving us </p>
<p class="line" id="line857"><a name="pos857"></a>information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line858"><a name="pos858"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Well nobody from Bloemfontein has come to </p>
<p class="line" id="line859"><a name="pos859"></a>tell us that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line860"><a name="pos860"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   I am now dealing with the report that I </p>
<p class="line" id="line861"><a name="pos861"></a>received and I am satisfied in my heart that this comes from </p>
<p class="line" id="line862"><a name="pos862"></a>Bloemfontein and I am satisfied that they only received this from </p>
<p class="line" id="line863"><a name="pos863"></a>one source and that was from Kondile.</p>
<p class="line" id="line864"><a name="pos864"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   What dealings have you had with Mr Danster </p>
<p class="line" id="line865"><a name="pos865"></a>after the death of Kondile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line866"><a name="pos866"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   I cannot remember.  He was still at the </p>
<p class="line" id="line867"><a name="pos867"></a>Security Branch and they charged him with one or other criminal </p>
<p class="line" id="line868"><a name="pos868"></a>offence and I really do not know anything more about the path </p>
<p class="line" id="line869"><a name="pos869"></a>that he followed.  It's a long time ago since I've seen him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line870"><a name="pos870"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Is he still in the police force?</p>
<p class="line" id="line871"><a name="pos871"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   No, not as far as I know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line872"><a name="pos872"></a>JUDGE PILLAY:   Mr du Plessis tell me, I've not doubt that you </p>
<p class="line" id="line873"><a name="pos873"></a>read the statement starting on page 13 of the record before you </p>
<p class="line" id="line874"><a name="pos874"></a>signed it.  That's your statement, your application for indemnity.</p>
<p class="line" id="line875"><a name="pos875"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line876"><a name="pos876"></a>JUDGE PILLAY:   You were absolutely satisfied with all the </p>
<p class="line" id="line877"><a name="pos877"></a>facts as contained in there before you signed it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line878"><a name="pos878"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   I believe that to be true, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line879"><a name="pos879"></a>JUDGE PILLAY:   That the question of sleeping agencies were </p>
<p class="line" id="line880"><a name="pos880"></a>possibly used on Mr Kondile before he was shot, was it only </p>
<p class="line" id="line881"><a name="pos881"></a>today or some time before?</p>
<p class="line" id="line882"><a name="pos882"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   I'm speaking under correction but the record </p>
<p class="line" id="line883"><a name="pos883"></a>can speak for itself. I think that in the Harms Commission it was </p>
<p class="line" id="line884"><a name="pos884"></a>mentioned, or in the first statement from Mr Coetzee which he </p>
<p class="line" id="line885"><a name="pos885"></a>made, I think he mentioned  it there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line886"><a name="pos886"></a>JUDGE PILLAY:    Did you accept that as the truth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line887"><a name="pos887"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:    No I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line888"><a name="pos888"></a>JUDGE PILLAY:    On  page 17, page 5 of your statement, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line889"><a name="pos889"></a>top line, your statement reads as follows:</p>
<p class="line" id="line890"><a name="pos890"></a>		"On that particular evening Mr Kondile was given a </p>
<p class="line" id="line891"><a name="pos891"></a>sleeping drug without his  knowledge."</p>
<p class="line" id="line892"><a name="pos892"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:    That's correct.  This fact I heard from </p>
<p class="line" id="line893"><a name="pos893"></a>Colonel van Rensburg after the incident that he had been given a </p>
<p class="line" id="line894"><a name="pos894"></a>sleeping drug.  However I did not see what had happened.  I did </p>
<p class="line" id="line895"><a name="pos895"></a>see that he had something to drink but I did not know that there </p>
<p class="line" id="line896"><a name="pos896"></a>was something in the drink.</p>
<p class="line" id="line897"><a name="pos897"></a>JUDGE PILLAY:   That fact was not within your personal </p>
<p class="line" id="line898"><a name="pos898"></a>knowledge as such?</p>
<p class="line" id="line899"><a name="pos899"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   No.  I did make the deduction and that is why </p>
<p class="line" id="line900"><a name="pos900"></a>it was discussed with us because from where he sat he just fell </p>
<p class="line" id="line901"><a name="pos901"></a>over.</p>
<p class="line" id="line902"><a name="pos902"></a>JUDGE PILLAY:   I see in one of the introductory questions you </p>
<p class="line" id="line903"><a name="pos903"></a>were also asked whether you were an official or member or </p>
<p class="line" id="line904"><a name="pos904"></a>supporter of any political organisation and so forth, if so name it </p>
<p class="line" id="line905"><a name="pos905"></a>and you said it's not applicable.</p>
<p class="line" id="line906"><a name="pos906"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   I think that we rectified this at a later stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line907"><a name="pos907"></a>JUDGE PILLAY:   I am sorry, because then the version I've got, </p>
<p class="line" id="line908"><a name="pos908"></a>the copy I've got say it's (...intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line909"><a name="pos909"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Mr Chairman with your permission, the copy </p>
<p class="line" id="line910"><a name="pos910"></a>I've got here, 7A is National Party member, if I can perhaps just </p>
<p class="line" id="line911"><a name="pos911"></a>show it to you, there may have been some logistic problems </p>
<p class="line" id="line912"><a name="pos912"></a>somewhere. But the NVP's(?) have definitely been corrected.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line913"><a name="pos913"></a>With the Commission's permission perhaps, no we haven't got </p>
<p class="line" id="line914"><a name="pos914"></a>typing logistics but if we could perhaps then just replace page 1 </p>
<p class="line" id="line915"><a name="pos915"></a>there, if it hasn't been done on the Commission's papers. I think </p>
<p class="line" id="line916"><a name="pos916"></a>we've got.....</p>
<p class="line" id="line917"><a name="pos917"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   The copy that we have does not include that.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line918"><a name="pos918"></a>I apologise, I don't know how this happened; may I ask, my </p>
<p class="line" id="line919"><a name="pos919"></a>lawyer still has two copies here, may  I just ask permission, we </p>
<p class="line" id="line920"><a name="pos920"></a>don't have any more but the others have been sent.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line921"><a name="pos921"></a>ADV DE JAGER:   Perhaps you must just ensure that the correct </p>
<p class="line" id="line922"><a name="pos922"></a>copies are in front of  us if there are amendments, because it may </p>
<p class="line" id="line923"><a name="pos923"></a>be that we will deal with documents which aren't the correct </p>
<p class="line" id="line924"><a name="pos924"></a>documents.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line925"><a name="pos925"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   We will definitely ensure that that is the case. </p>
<p class="line" id="line926"><a name="pos926"></a> I will ask my lawyer to look at the committee member's </p>
<p class="line" id="line927"><a name="pos927"></a>documents and to ensure that they're correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line928"><a name="pos928"></a>ADV STEENKAMP:    I can just say that the documents that you </p>
<p class="line" id="line929"><a name="pos929"></a>have in front of you was the copies of the latest amnesty </p>
<p class="line" id="line930"><a name="pos930"></a>applications that we had in our possession.</p>
<p class="line" id="line931"><a name="pos931"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   However you'll have these made, you'll have </p>
<p class="line" id="line932"><a name="pos932"></a>copies made for everybody and make that available to all of us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line933"><a name="pos933"></a>JUDGE PILLAY:    Then Mr du Plessis, I understand that </p>
<p class="line" id="line934"><a name="pos934"></a>Humansdorp was perceived, or the police cells in Humansdorp </p>
<p class="line" id="line935"><a name="pos935"></a>was perceived to be as you put it, a safe cell?</p>
<p class="line" id="line936"><a name="pos936"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:    Actually Jeffrey's Bay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line937"><a name="pos937"></a>JUDGE PILLAY:    Was Humansdorp Police Station not as </p>
<p class="line" id="line938"><a name="pos938"></a>appropriate as you would have wanted it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line939"><a name="pos939"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:    That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line940"><a name="pos940"></a>JUDGE PILLAY:    Why was he then sent to Humansdorp in  the </p>
<p class="line" id="line941"><a name="pos941"></a>first  place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line942"><a name="pos942"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   Because other detainees were being detained </p>
<p class="line" id="line943"><a name="pos943"></a>at Jeffrey's Bay at that stage and we could not get any other </p>
<p class="line" id="line944"><a name="pos944"></a>accommodation for them at that stage as far as I can remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line945"><a name="pos945"></a>JUDGE PILLAY:    Now how long after  you first met him did </p>
<p class="line" id="line946"><a name="pos946"></a>you make this offer to become an informer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line947"><a name="pos947"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   At this stage I must speculate, possibly </p>
<p class="line" id="line948"><a name="pos948"></a>fourteen days after that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line949"><a name="pos949"></a>JUDGE PILLAY:   Did you assault him as you described before </p>
<p class="line" id="line950"><a name="pos950"></a>then or after then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line951"><a name="pos951"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   No, before that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line952"><a name="pos952"></a>JUDGE PILLAY:   And how long after your offer did he accept </p>
<p class="line" id="line953"><a name="pos953"></a>the offer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line954"><a name="pos954"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:    His co-operation was so good that it is </p>
<p class="line" id="line955"><a name="pos955"></a>difficult to say.   A day or two or three thereafter he said that he </p>
<p class="line" id="line956"><a name="pos956"></a>was prepared to cooperate.  There were still questions that posed </p>
<p class="line" id="line957"><a name="pos957"></a>a problem and one was as to how he was going to be transferred </p>
<p class="line" id="line958"><a name="pos958"></a>and he made suggestions himself as to how he could be taken up </p>
<p class="line" id="line959"><a name="pos959"></a>into this stream again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line960"><a name="pos960"></a>JUDGE PILLAY:    And did you only assault him on one day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line961"><a name="pos961"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:    I can recall one day specifically but if </p>
<p class="line" id="line962"><a name="pos962"></a>someone tells me that it was twice then I would believe it to be </p>
<p class="line" id="line963"><a name="pos963"></a>true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line964"><a name="pos964"></a>JUDGE PILLAY:    How long after you first met him and started </p>
<p class="line" id="line965"><a name="pos965"></a>to interrogate  him did you find it necessary to assault him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line966"><a name="pos966"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:    It was not very long thereafter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line967"><a name="pos967"></a>JUDGE PILLAY:    And then over two weeks of interrogation and </p>
<p class="line" id="line968"><a name="pos968"></a>perhaps assault if I can include it, you then decided that he'd been </p>
<p class="line" id="line969"><a name="pos969"></a>broken down sufficiently to make him the offer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line970"><a name="pos970"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:    No we did not break him down.  In the </p>
<p class="line" id="line971"><a name="pos971"></a>beginning we did.  I did that personally, but thereafter he gave his </p>
<p class="line" id="line972"><a name="pos972"></a>co-operation and we started building him up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line973"><a name="pos973"></a>JUDGE PILLAY:    Now tell me,  after the decision, as you put it </p>
<p class="line" id="line974"><a name="pos974"></a>in your statement, it was an agreement between the top three </p>
<p class="line" id="line975"><a name="pos975"></a>members of the Security Police in Port Elizabeth, it was decided </p>
<p class="line" id="line976"><a name="pos976"></a>that Mr Kondile should be assassinated.   You then asked </p>
<p class="line" id="line977"><a name="pos977"></a>someone whether he'd participate in it. Who was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line978"><a name="pos978"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:    Mr Raath.</p>
<p class="line" id="line979"><a name="pos979"></a>JUDGE PILLAY:    And he took some time to consider the issue </p>
<p class="line" id="line980"><a name="pos980"></a>and then came back to you and said he was willing to participate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line981"><a name="pos981"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:    Yes it could have been the same day or the </p>
<p class="line" id="line982"><a name="pos982"></a>next day, I cannot remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line983"><a name="pos983"></a>JUDGE PILLAY:    Did you explain to him the whole history </p>
<p class="line" id="line984"><a name="pos984"></a>behind the decision and what was going to happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line985"><a name="pos985"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:    In general yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line986"><a name="pos986"></a>JUDGE PILLAY:    What would have been his position had he </p>
<p class="line" id="line987"><a name="pos987"></a>refused to cooperate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line988"><a name="pos988"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:    Nothing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line989"><a name="pos989"></a>JUDGE PILLAY:    He would have known all this information?</p>
<p class="line" id="line990"><a name="pos990"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:    No no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line991"><a name="pos991"></a>JUDGE PILLAY:    Would he not have been a danger to certain </p>
<p class="line" id="line992"><a name="pos992"></a>members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line993"><a name="pos993"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   No Mr Raath was never present where we </p>
<p class="line" id="line994"><a name="pos994"></a>dealt with the briefing and the informer story.  I did this on my </p>
<p class="line" id="line995"><a name="pos995"></a>own.  I made mistakes with Kondile but I did not make that </p>
<p class="line" id="line996"><a name="pos996"></a>mistake.</p>
<p class="line" id="line997"><a name="pos997"></a>ADV DE JAGER:   Is he not asking you as to you informed Raath </p>
<p class="line" id="line998"><a name="pos998"></a>that you were going to murder this man, so Raath knew that you </p>
<p class="line" id="line999"><a name="pos999"></a>were going to murder him?  And what would have happened if he </p>
<p class="line" id="line1000"><a name="pos1000"></a>had said that he was not going to cooperate?  Surely then he </p>
<p class="line" id="line1001"><a name="pos1001"></a>could have laid charges against you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1002"><a name="pos1002"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   I trusted him, I had the confidence in him to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1003"><a name="pos1003"></a>say voluntarily whether he wanted to go with or not and that he </p>
<p class="line" id="line1004"><a name="pos1004"></a>would have left it at that.  That's a chance that we took.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1005"><a name="pos1005"></a>JUDGE PILLAY:   You testified that whatever you did to Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line1006"><a name="pos1006"></a>Kondile and your participation whatever occurred to him,  you </p>
<p class="line" id="line1007"><a name="pos1007"></a>did not on a personal basis but rather as part of your duty as a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1008"><a name="pos1008"></a>policeman.   What duty would that be?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1009"><a name="pos1009"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   Well in the first instance my task was to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1010"><a name="pos1010"></a>protect the government against enemy forces; we were in a state </p>
<p class="line" id="line1011"><a name="pos1011"></a>of war at that stage with the ANC and I was sent by the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1012"><a name="pos1012"></a>government to Rhodesia to Zimbabwe or as it was then called, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1013"><a name="pos1013"></a>Rhodesia, where we did the same and all that happened there was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1014"><a name="pos1014"></a>that it was across our border and this inside our border; so it </p>
<p class="line" id="line1015"><a name="pos1015"></a>remains the same.  If one ran into one another and shot one </p>
<p class="line" id="line1016"><a name="pos1016"></a>another, it remained the same.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1017"><a name="pos1017"></a>JUDGE PILLAY:   Members of the South African Police even </p>
<p class="line" id="line1018"><a name="pos1018"></a>now have the power to shoot, even to kill under certain precise </p>
<p class="line" id="line1019"><a name="pos1019"></a>guide lines, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1020"><a name="pos1020"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:    That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1021"><a name="pos1021"></a>JUDGE PILLAY:   Would you agree that this would not fall under </p>
<p class="line" id="line1022"><a name="pos1022"></a>that,  would not be covered by the Act?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1023"><a name="pos1023"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1024"><a name="pos1024"></a>ADV GCABASHE:   Mr Du Plessis, if you can help me with one </p>
<p class="line" id="line1025"><a name="pos1025"></a>point. Sizwe Kondile agreed to work for you.  He then turned on </p>
<p class="line" id="line1026"><a name="pos1026"></a>you.  You drove to Barberton and he was in shackles if I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1027"><a name="pos1027"></a>understood the translation correctly. Is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1028"><a name="pos1028"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:    I do not believe that he was handcuffed, I do </p>
<p class="line" id="line1029"><a name="pos1029"></a>not recall saying that.  Nor can I remember, it's possible but I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1030"><a name="pos1030"></a>cannot remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1031"><a name="pos1031"></a>ADV GCABASHE:   He was then shackled or tied to the tree, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1032"><a name="pos1032"></a>that was your evidence if I understood you correctly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1033"><a name="pos1033"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:    Yes there he was bound or shackled.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1034"><a name="pos1034"></a>ADV GCABASHE:   Now if this man became a comrade of yours </p>
<p class="line" id="line1035"><a name="pos1035"></a>because he had agreed to work for you,  why was he shackled to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1036"><a name="pos1036"></a>the tree?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1037"><a name="pos1037"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:    He leant against the tree, he wasn't tied to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1038"><a name="pos1038"></a>the tree, his hands were just cuffed and we had just told one </p>
<p class="line" id="line1039"><a name="pos1039"></a>another that at that stage it had already been decided as to what </p>
<p class="line" id="line1040"><a name="pos1040"></a>his end would be.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1041"><a name="pos1041"></a>ADV GCABASHE:   So he wasn't shackled to the tree but his </p>
<p class="line" id="line1042"><a name="pos1042"></a>hands were cuffed at that stage, yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1043"><a name="pos1043"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:    Yes that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1044"><a name="pos1044"></a>ADV GCABASHE:   And when you gave him his drinks he had </p>
<p class="line" id="line1045"><a name="pos1045"></a>these with his hands cuffed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1046"><a name="pos1046"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:    I did not give him his drink.  I do not recall </p>
<p class="line" id="line1047"><a name="pos1047"></a>if anybody untied him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1048"><a name="pos1048"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   But you did say that he was given something </p>
<p class="line" id="line1049"><a name="pos1049"></a>to eat and drink.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1050"><a name="pos1050"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:    That's correct but I cannot remember in </p>
<p class="line" id="line1051"><a name="pos1051"></a>detail whether he was cuffed while he was eating or drinking.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1052"><a name="pos1052"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   But you do remember that he was cuffed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1053"><a name="pos1053"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1054"><a name="pos1054"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   You do remember that he was given something </p>
<p class="line" id="line1055"><a name="pos1055"></a>to eat and drink.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1056"><a name="pos1056"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1057"><a name="pos1057"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Well the question is this, what is the only </p>
<p class="line" id="line1058"><a name="pos1058"></a>inference you can draw from that?  That somebody else took the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1059"><a name="pos1059"></a>cuffs off?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1060"><a name="pos1060"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   He could have eaten with his handcuffs on, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1061"><a name="pos1061"></a>that's the other deduction you can make, that he could have been </p>
<p class="line" id="line1062"><a name="pos1062"></a>eating and drinking with his cuffs on but I cannot recall this </p>
<p class="line" id="line1063"><a name="pos1063"></a>specifically.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1064"><a name="pos1064"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   And I trust nobody told him why he was being </p>
<p class="line" id="line1065"><a name="pos1065"></a>cuffed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1066"><a name="pos1066"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:    I don't believe so.  It could also be that we </p>
<p class="line" id="line1067"><a name="pos1067"></a>told him, but I really don't know.  It's too long ago.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1068"><a name="pos1068"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   This is a very dramatic situation isn't it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1069"><a name="pos1069"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:    That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1070"><a name="pos1070"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, now here is a man who co-operates with </p>
<p class="line" id="line1071"><a name="pos1071"></a>you, you know that he is not a true co-operator, he does not </p>
<p class="line" id="line1072"><a name="pos1072"></a>know that you have found out his duplicity towards you.  You </p>
<p class="line" id="line1073"><a name="pos1073"></a>take him in the car travelling a long distance.  As far as  you are </p>
<p class="line" id="line1074"><a name="pos1074"></a>concerned, at no stage he's told that you have found him out and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1075"><a name="pos1075"></a>you haven't told us what his attitude was, whether he asked you </p>
<p class="line" id="line1076"><a name="pos1076"></a>where he was being taken, why he was being taken and so on.  All </p>
<p class="line" id="line1077"><a name="pos1077"></a>I gather from your information is at various stages you say you </p>
<p class="line" id="line1078"><a name="pos1078"></a>can't remember.  Now these are important facets of the case and I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1079"><a name="pos1079"></a>would like you to to try and remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1080"><a name="pos1080"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:  On several occasions I have tried to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1081"><a name="pos1081"></a>remember, I cannot remember.  We transported many people from </p>
<p class="line" id="line1082"><a name="pos1082"></a>one place to another, it can be that we gave them a reason and I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1083"><a name="pos1083"></a>can think of quite a few if I must speculate, but I do not believe </p>
<p class="line" id="line1084"><a name="pos1084"></a>that that's what you expect of me.  I can think of no way or of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1085"><a name="pos1085"></a>anything that I can recall as to what happened between the two of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1086"><a name="pos1086"></a>us at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1087"><a name="pos1087"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   You must recall whether at any stage you </p>
<p class="line" id="line1088"><a name="pos1088"></a>communicated to Kondile that he is an enemy of the state and you </p>
<p class="line" id="line1089"><a name="pos1089"></a>are going to kill him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1090"><a name="pos1090"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:  I doubt whether I ever did that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1091"><a name="pos1091"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   And what about your colleagues?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1092"><a name="pos1092"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   Well not what I heard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1093"><a name="pos1093"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Whose idea was it that his drink should be </p>
<p class="line" id="line1094"><a name="pos1094"></a>laced?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1095"><a name="pos1095"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   I don't know. I've heard from General van </p>
<p class="line" id="line1096"><a name="pos1096"></a>Rensburg that this was done by Dirk.  But I did not see that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1097"><a name="pos1097"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  You didn't see all this, was it because it was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1098"><a name="pos1098"></a>dark or was there some other reason?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1099"><a name="pos1099"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   In the first instance, I wanted to see as little </p>
<p class="line" id="line1100"><a name="pos1100"></a>as possible about what was happening there.  That I could say in </p>
<p class="line" id="line1101"><a name="pos1101"></a>all honesty today.  This was not something I wished to be </p>
<p class="line" id="line1102"><a name="pos1102"></a>involved in and psychologically one tries to get this out of your </p>
<p class="line" id="line1103"><a name="pos1103"></a>system as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1104"><a name="pos1104"></a>ADV DE JAGER:   This sleeping drug, would it have been </p>
<p class="line" id="line1105"><a name="pos1105"></a>possible if he saw that that he did not want to drink that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1106"><a name="pos1106"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   Well I think so, yes. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1107"><a name="pos1107"></a>ADV DE JAGER:   So as far as you know it was not thrown in so </p>
<p class="line" id="line1108"><a name="pos1108"></a>that he could see it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1109"><a name="pos1109"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:  It was possible that this was put into </p>
<p class="line" id="line1110"><a name="pos1110"></a>something to drink because Dirk said that and van Rensburg said </p>
<p class="line" id="line1111"><a name="pos1111"></a>that, and I've asked them pertinently, why did this man fall over? </p>
<p class="line" id="line1112"><a name="pos1112"></a> It was strange at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1113"><a name="pos1113"></a>ADV DE JAGER:   You say it was not necessary to assault this </p>
<p class="line" id="line1114"><a name="pos1114"></a>person because he did give his co-operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1115"><a name="pos1115"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:  That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1116"><a name="pos1116"></a>ADV DE JAGER:   But let's suppose I come from East London </p>
<p class="line" id="line1117"><a name="pos1117"></a>and I ask him questions, he does not answer, and the reason is not </p>
<p class="line" id="line1118"><a name="pos1118"></a>that he doesn't want to answer, but that  he doesn't have the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1119"><a name="pos1119"></a>information and he says I don't know. Is that not a probability </p>
<p class="line" id="line1120"><a name="pos1120"></a>that I am convinced or I think he knows that he could be </p>
<p class="line" id="line1121"><a name="pos1121"></a>assaulted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1122"><a name="pos1122"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:  That's a probability yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1123"><a name="pos1123"></a>ADV DE JAGER:   Because we think that he's hiding something </p>
<p class="line" id="line1124"><a name="pos1124"></a>while he indeed does not know, he's not hiding anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1125"><a name="pos1125"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:    That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1126"><a name="pos1126"></a>ADV DE JAGER:   And did it happen to you that you assault a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1127"><a name="pos1127"></a>person while you think that he knows, whereas he did not know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1128"><a name="pos1128"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   Yes it did happen before.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1129"><a name="pos1129"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Any questions you wish to put to this witness </p>
<p class="line" id="line1130"><a name="pos1130"></a>in re-examination?                   </p>
<p class="line" id="line1131"><a name="pos1131"></a>ADV VISSER:   Well Mr Chairman before you get to Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line1132"><a name="pos1132"></a>Booyens, I believe I've been skipped.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1133"><a name="pos1133"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry - to the extent that your client has been </p>
<p class="line" id="line1134"><a name="pos1134"></a>implicated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1135"><a name="pos1135"></a>ADV VISSER:    Yes of course Mr Chairman.   I've only got two </p>
<p class="line" id="line1136"><a name="pos1136"></a>points which I think should be addressed very briefly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1137"><a name="pos1137"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Yes put them Mr Visser.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1138"><a name="pos1138"></a>EXAMINATION BY ADV VISSER:   Mr du Plessis, you </p>
<p class="line" id="line1139"><a name="pos1139"></a>explained to the Committee what the danger was that you foresaw </p>
<p class="line" id="line1140"><a name="pos1140"></a>what could happen to your network should Mr Kondile be charged </p>
<p class="line" id="line1141"><a name="pos1141"></a>or came into contact with other people or should he be released.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1142"><a name="pos1142"></a>You remember that evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1143"><a name="pos1143"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:    That is correct yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1144"><a name="pos1144"></a>ADV VISSER:   You did not say anything about what, according </p>
<p class="line" id="line1145"><a name="pos1145"></a>to your experience, would happen to the principal agent.  From </p>
<p class="line" id="line1146"><a name="pos1146"></a>your experience could you give any evidence to the Committee </p>
<p class="line" id="line1147"><a name="pos1147"></a>regarding that.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1148"><a name="pos1148"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:    If that were exposed he would have been </p>
<p class="line" id="line1149"><a name="pos1149"></a>murdered and he would have been forced to expose his other </p>
<p class="line" id="line1150"><a name="pos1150"></a>informers and they would have been in the same danger.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1151"><a name="pos1151"></a>ADV VISSER:   A second aspect which I just want to touch upon </p>
<p class="line" id="line1152"><a name="pos1152"></a>(...intervention) </p>
<p class="line" id="line1153"><a name="pos1153"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Unless they converted him into an ANC </p>
<p class="line" id="line1154"><a name="pos1154"></a>informer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1155"><a name="pos1155"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:   If you want to take that chance, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1156"><a name="pos1156"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1157"><a name="pos1157"></a>ADV VISSER:   A second aspect referring to a question asked by </p>
<p class="line" id="line1158"><a name="pos1158"></a>Mr Nyoka, my learned friend, which you should expand upon.  As </p>
<p class="line" id="line1159"><a name="pos1159"></a>I've understood the question; when you were thinking about who </p>
<p class="line" id="line1160"><a name="pos1160"></a>should participate, who from PE should participate in this </p>
<p class="line" id="line1161"><a name="pos1161"></a>undertaking, the question was posed, which role did you envisage </p>
<p class="line" id="line1162"><a name="pos1162"></a>for each of these persons? And perhaps you did not think the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1163"><a name="pos1163"></a>same as I think my learned friend wanted it to achieve.  Thinking </p>
<p class="line" id="line1164"><a name="pos1164"></a>back and if you can't remember, say so, think back, there  were </p>
<p class="line" id="line1165"><a name="pos1165"></a>three of you; it was van Rensburg, you and Raath who went there. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1166"><a name="pos1166"></a> If you can start, why did Raath have to go with? </p>
<p class="line" id="line1167"><a name="pos1167"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:    He had to drive the vehicle from </p>
<p class="line" id="line1168"><a name="pos1168"></a>Bloemfontein to Komatipoort.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1169"><a name="pos1169"></a>ADV VISSER:   This will also be Raath's evidence that this was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1170"><a name="pos1170"></a>what was put to him.  The next question is and I'm trying to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1171"><a name="pos1171"></a>refresh your memory, in those circumstances would you inform </p>
<p class="line" id="line1172"><a name="pos1172"></a>Raath fully what you intended to do with Kondile or can't you </p>
<p class="line" id="line1173"><a name="pos1173"></a>remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1174"><a name="pos1174"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:    I can't remember but I think I did inform him </p>
<p class="line" id="line1175"><a name="pos1175"></a>fully.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1176"><a name="pos1176"></a>ADV VISSER:   You and Mr van Rensburg, why was it necessary </p>
<p class="line" id="line1177"><a name="pos1177"></a>that the two of you had to travel with Mr Kondile in the vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1178"><a name="pos1178"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:    In the first place the negotiations with </p>
<p class="line" id="line1179"><a name="pos1179"></a>Coetzee was not done by myself but by Mr van Rensburg and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1180"><a name="pos1180"></a>there was somebody who still needed protection.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1181"><a name="pos1181"></a>ADV VISSER:   Did you think there was the danger that he would </p>
<p class="line" id="line1182"><a name="pos1182"></a>try to escape along the road?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1183"><a name="pos1183"></a>MR DU PLESSIS:    No but he could start suspecting something, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1184"><a name="pos1184"></a>that was a possibility yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1185"><a name="pos1185"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Any re-examination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1186"><a name="pos1186"></a>MR JANSEN:   Mr Chairman may I interrupt prior to re-</p>
<p class="line" id="line1187"><a name="pos1187"></a>examination.  I know the issue was mooted this morning as to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1188"><a name="pos1188"></a>what the position of the other parties were here.  Mr Chairman </p>
<p class="line" id="line1189"><a name="pos1189"></a>representing Mr Coetzee, may I just place myself on record, I'm R </p>
<p class="line" id="line1190"><a name="pos1190"></a>Jansen, instructed by Mr Knight on behalf of Mr Coetzee.  Our </p>
<p class="line" id="line1191"><a name="pos1191"></a>position is still that we would like to cross-examine the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1192"><a name="pos1192"></a>applicants, most certainly if it is intended to call Mr Coetzee as a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1193"><a name="pos1193"></a>witness and we would like the Committee to make a ruling on </p>
<p class="line" id="line1194"><a name="pos1194"></a>that.  There are a couple of reasons Mr Chairman why I submit  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1195"><a name="pos1195"></a>cross-examination should be allowed. Firstly the version of Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line1196"><a name="pos1196"></a>Coetzee has never been tested in a scenario where any other </p>
<p class="line" id="line1197"><a name="pos1197"></a>person has admitted any involvement in the murder of Kondile and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1198"><a name="pos1198"></a>that in itself makes these hearings completely different to any of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1199"><a name="pos1199"></a>the other hearings that have taken place relating to this incident </p>
<p class="line" id="line1200"><a name="pos1200"></a>and I submit that there are various aspects on which Mr Coetzee's </p>
<p class="line" id="line1201"><a name="pos1201"></a>evidence at this stage, considering the new allegations or the new </p>
<p class="line" id="line1202"><a name="pos1202"></a>facts presented by these applicants can assist this committee to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1203"><a name="pos1203"></a>come to the truth.  I may just mention one fact for instance is the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1204"><a name="pos1204"></a>incrimination of a Mr Roy Otto, that's the first time that we hear </p>
<p class="line" id="line1205"><a name="pos1205"></a>of his involvement.  Now other than the fact that this person is </p>
<p class="line" id="line1206"><a name="pos1206"></a>deceased, Mr Chairman, the facts of the matter are that there is </p>
<p class="line" id="line1207"><a name="pos1207"></a>documentation available which suggested that Mr Otto was on </p>
<p class="line" id="line1208"><a name="pos1208"></a>leave at the time, in fact had been on leave for a month and a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1209"><a name="pos1209"></a>half, which gives credence to the suggestion that there is </p>
<p class="line" id="line1210"><a name="pos1210"></a>something sinister in the choice of a dead person to be the person </p>
<p class="line" id="line1211"><a name="pos1211"></a>shooting or committing the actual killing.  It's this type of thing </p>
<p class="line" id="line1212"><a name="pos1212"></a>which I submit has to be considered.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1213"><a name="pos1213"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Well no that's totally unrelated to your client, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1214"><a name="pos1214"></a>because your client doesn't mention any names of the persons that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1215"><a name="pos1215"></a>did the shooting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1216"><a name="pos1216"></a>MR JANSEN:    No but he men (...intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1217"><a name="pos1217"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   He doesn't implicate Otto.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1218"><a name="pos1218"></a>No Mr Chairman, but what he does do is he mentions, Flemington, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1219"><a name="pos1219"></a>he mentions a person on Flemington's staff which he describes as </p>
<p class="line" id="line1220"><a name="pos1220"></a>being a tall slender, blond-haired person whereas Roy Otto, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1221"><a name="pos1221"></a>evidence will be, fits the opposite description, fairly short, stocky </p>
<p class="line" id="line1222"><a name="pos1222"></a>and not blond at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1223"><a name="pos1223"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Whether you're client's evidence </p>
<p class="line" id="line1224"><a name="pos1224"></a>becomes relevant or not in these hearings is a matter which this </p>
<p class="line" id="line1225"><a name="pos1225"></a>Committee would like to consider.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1226"><a name="pos1226"></a>ADV VISSER:   Yes Mr Chairman.  The only problem is, that's </p>
<p class="line" id="line1227"><a name="pos1227"></a>why I say that that ruling must be made now for the simple reason </p>
<p class="line" id="line1228"><a name="pos1228"></a>that should his evidence become relevant, comments that he will </p>
<p class="line" id="line1229"><a name="pos1229"></a>be making on this new evidence which he's never had the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1230"><a name="pos1230"></a>opportunity of making comments on will then be placed on record </p>
<p class="line" id="line1231"><a name="pos1231"></a>and these applicants would never have had the opportunity to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1232"><a name="pos1232"></a>respond to what he said there.  Now it may work unfairly both </p>
<p class="line" id="line1233"><a name="pos1233"></a>ways, it may work unfairly against Mr Coetzee, it may work </p>
<p class="line" id="line1234"><a name="pos1234"></a>unfairly against these applicants.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1235"><a name="pos1235"></a>ADV DE JAGER:   Well on the other hand, if he's not giving </p>
<p class="line" id="line1236"><a name="pos1236"></a>evidence here and he's not cross-examined, Mr Coetzee for </p>
<p class="line" id="line1237"><a name="pos1237"></a>instance, then his evidence cannot be used against the present </p>
<p class="line" id="line1238"><a name="pos1238"></a>applicants.  If the present applicants do not give evidence against </p>
<p class="line" id="line1239"><a name="pos1239"></a>Mr Coetzee in his application and he hasn't had the opportunity to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1240"><a name="pos1240"></a>cross-examine them, then we as a committee can't use their </p>
<p class="line" id="line1241"><a name="pos1241"></a>evidence in motivating a refusal of his amnesty application </p>
<p class="line" id="line1242"><a name="pos1242"></a>because he didn't have the opportunity to cross-examine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1243"><a name="pos1243"></a>ADV VISSER:   Yes honourable member, that was in fact our </p>
<p class="line" id="line1244"><a name="pos1244"></a>position right at the outset in October last year that we merely </p>
<p class="line" id="line1245"><a name="pos1245"></a>intended placing our version on record because we do not have a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1246"><a name="pos1246"></a>ruling as to what other further evidence may affect Mr Coetzee's </p>
<p class="line" id="line1247"><a name="pos1247"></a>amnesty application.  I think it's quite clear that the Committees </p>
<p class="line" id="line1248"><a name="pos1248"></a>are waiting to hear all the evidence before bringing out some </p>
<p class="line" id="line1249"><a name="pos1249"></a>findings.  Now if there is a ruling that the evidence led here will </p>
<p class="line" id="line1250"><a name="pos1250"></a>not  affect that application, then you are completely correct and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1251"><a name="pos1251"></a>that was in fact our position right at the start.  However there </p>
<p class="line" id="line1252"><a name="pos1252"></a>was a very clear indication last time and I accept that the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1253"><a name="pos1253"></a>Committee is comprised differently this time, but there was a very </p>
<p class="line" id="line1254"><a name="pos1254"></a>clear indication that his evidence is very necessary and that these </p>
<p class="line" id="line1255"><a name="pos1255"></a>issues are considered, the differences are considered as material </p>
<p class="line" id="line1256"><a name="pos1256"></a>disputes and would have to be canvassed.  -  As it pleases.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1257"><a name="pos1257"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Jansen the Committee has considered your </p>
<p class="line" id="line1258"><a name="pos1258"></a>request to put questions to this witness and the Committee is of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1259"><a name="pos1259"></a>the view that you should be afforded the opportunity to do so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1260"><a name="pos1260"></a>MR JANSEN:   Thank you Mr Chairman.   </p>
<p class="line" id="line1261"><a name="pos1261"></a>ADV VISSER:   Mr Chairman with great respect we have an </p>
<p class="line" id="line1262"><a name="pos1262"></a>interest in what is going on here.  There has been an argument </p>
<p class="line" id="line1263"><a name="pos1263"></a>addressed to you.  My learned friend Mr Booyens hasn't been </p>
<p class="line" id="line1264"><a name="pos1264"></a>given an opportunity, nor have I or been asked whether we have </p>
<p class="line" id="line1265"><a name="pos1265"></a>any contribution to make Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1266"><a name="pos1266"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   No the Committee has decided that we would </p>
<p class="line" id="line1267"><a name="pos1267"></a>like to hear this.  It doesn't depend upon what counsel in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1268"><a name="pos1268"></a>matter have to say.  The Committee is of the view that this is an </p>
<p class="line" id="line1269"><a name="pos1269"></a>enquiry.  We would like to hear the evidence and it may be when </p>
<p class="line" id="line1270"><a name="pos1270"></a>the time comes, that you will have the right to question Dirk </p>
<p class="line" id="line1271"><a name="pos1271"></a>Coetzee when he gives evidence</p>
<p class="line" id="line1272"><a name="pos1272"></a>	Mr Booyens I am allowing the questioning of your witness </p>
<p class="line" id="line1273"><a name="pos1273"></a>by counsel for Dirk Coetzee.  The Committee hasn't made up its </p>
<p class="line" id="line1274"><a name="pos1274"></a>mind on Dirk Coetzee's evidence on this Kondile matter, and in </p>
<p class="line" id="line1275"><a name="pos1275"></a>order that justice may be done, it does seem that your client </p>
<p class="line" id="line1276"><a name="pos1276"></a>should be afforded the opportunity wherever his evidence varies </p>
<p class="line" id="line1277"><a name="pos1277"></a>with the evidence of Dirk Coetzee to put that to Dirk Coetzee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1278"><a name="pos1278"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Yes Mr Chairman I hear the Committee's </p>
<p class="line" id="line1279"><a name="pos1279"></a>ruling.  Of course it seems to me that if the decision is only made </p>
<p class="line" id="line1280"><a name="pos1280"></a>at the end of the day then whether or not to call Mr Coetzee then </p>
<p class="line" id="line1281"><a name="pos1281"></a>the Committee may find itself in an extremely difficult position if </p>
<p class="line" id="line1282"><a name="pos1282"></a>Coetzee then is not called then what value, if any, do you attach </p>
<p class="line" id="line1283"><a name="pos1283"></a>to the questions and to the answers because then - at the moment </p>
<p class="line" id="line1284"><a name="pos1284"></a>you've got to answer it like you would for a witness that would </p>
<p class="line" id="line1285"><a name="pos1285"></a>be called.  But the moment, if he's not called, then the answers </p>
<p class="line" id="line1286"><a name="pos1286"></a>became answers to a collateral issue and is his first answer would </p>
<p class="line" id="line1287"><a name="pos1287"></a>be relevant ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1288"><a name="pos1288"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   No the only reason why we think that Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line1289"><a name="pos1289"></a>Swart should be allowed to put questions to Dirk Coetzee </p>
<p class="line" id="line1290"><a name="pos1290"></a>...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1291"><a name="pos1291"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   No to du Plessis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1292"><a name="pos1292"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, on behalf of Dirk Coetzee, so that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1293"><a name="pos1293"></a>Dirk Coetzee be made available.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1294"><a name="pos1294"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Oh, yes no, then we understand each other Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line1295"><a name="pos1295"></a>Chairman.  Mr Chairman but may I suggest that Mr Jansen depart </p>
<p class="line" id="line1296"><a name="pos1296"></a>on his excursion tomorrow.  I see it's already four o'clock, or </p>
<p class="line" id="line1297"><a name="pos1297"></a>otherwise could I perhaps just ask for a short adjournment.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1298"><a name="pos1298"></a>received a S.O.S. message from my right-hand side </p>
<p class="line" id="line1299"><a name="pos1299"></a>...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1300"><a name="pos1300"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   I understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1301"><a name="pos1301"></a>MR MARAIS:   Mr Chairman before the adjournment, Marais here </p>
<p class="line" id="line1302"><a name="pos1302"></a>representing Nofomela and Tshikalanga.  I would submit that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1303"><a name="pos1303"></a>since both my clients received notices in terms of Section 29 that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1304"><a name="pos1304"></a>they have to appear here and that they may be required to provide </p>
<p class="line" id="line1305"><a name="pos1305"></a>statements or to answer questions and since the credibility of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1306"><a name="pos1306"></a>either Dirk Coetzee in this matter or the credibility of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1307"><a name="pos1307"></a>applicants in this matter may affect the outcome of the amnesty </p>
<p class="line" id="line1308"><a name="pos1308"></a>application of either of those two, and insofar as the amnesty </p>
<p class="line" id="line1309"><a name="pos1309"></a>application of Coetzee is linked in general to the amnesty </p>
<p class="line" id="line1310"><a name="pos1310"></a>application of both Nofomela and Tshikalanga that I should also </p>
<p class="line" id="line1311"><a name="pos1311"></a>be afforded the opportunity to cross-examine, inasfar as it may be </p>
<p class="line" id="line1312"><a name="pos1312"></a>necessary after Mr Jansen, for Mr Coetzee, has dealt with the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1313"><a name="pos1313"></a>matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1314"><a name="pos1314"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   I have not understood the reason why your </p>
<p class="line" id="line1315"><a name="pos1315"></a>client has been served with a notice in the first place.  It's </p>
<p class="line" id="line1316"><a name="pos1316"></a>unfortunate that they have been asked to come here and make </p>
<p class="line" id="line1317"><a name="pos1317"></a>themselves available.  They have not been implicated by anybody </p>
<p class="line" id="line1318"><a name="pos1318"></a>in these proceedings.  They have not been implicated by Dirk </p>
<p class="line" id="line1319"><a name="pos1319"></a>Coetzee and so I don't know what purpose will be served by </p>
<p class="line" id="line1320"><a name="pos1320"></a>asking your two clients to be here.  And as far as I see at present </p>
<p class="line" id="line1321"><a name="pos1321"></a>it seems that we will not require your clients to be here.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1322"><a name="pos1322"></a>Whatever the Committee may find in respect of Dirk Coetzee's </p>
<p class="line" id="line1323"><a name="pos1323"></a>evidence cannot impact on your client because your client is not </p>
<p class="line" id="line1324"><a name="pos1324"></a>touched by these proceedings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1325"><a name="pos1325"></a>MR MARAIS:   Not in this incident specifically but in general </p>
<p class="line" id="line1326"><a name="pos1326"></a>with regard to the credibility ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1327"><a name="pos1327"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   No it won't be, the credibility of Dirk Coetzee </p>
<p class="line" id="line1328"><a name="pos1328"></a>in this matter he has applied for 30, 40 applications and I am of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1329"><a name="pos1329"></a>the view that your clients are not involved in this application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1330"><a name="pos1330"></a>MR MARAIS:   As it pleases you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1331"><a name="pos1331"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Now I propose commencing at nine </p>
<p class="line" id="line1332"><a name="pos1332"></a>o'clock tomorrow morning.  Is there anybody who is against the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1333"><a name="pos1333"></a>idea?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1334"><a name="pos1334"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Mr Chairman the area where we live we have a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1335"><a name="pos1335"></a>problem, if we commence at 9:30 there will be lighter traffic.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1336"><a name="pos1336"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   I would suggest that we try and be here at nine </p>
<p class="line" id="line1337"><a name="pos1337"></a>o'clock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1338"><a name="pos1338"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   Certainly Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1339"><a name="pos1339"></a>ADV DE JAGER:   The heavy traffic before seven Mr Booyens.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1340"><a name="pos1340"></a>ADV BOOYENS:   No Mr Chairman that's not what I suggested.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1341"><a name="pos1341"></a>Words are being put in my mouth again which I haven't uttered.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1342"><a name="pos1342"></a>ADV VALUS:   I have not addressed you.  I am representing </p>
<p class="line" id="line1343"><a name="pos1343"></a>Ginotry Danster.  This is a very important witness and it's my </p>
<p class="line" id="line1344"><a name="pos1344"></a>submission, and I understand that Mr Jansen has the authorisation </p>
<p class="line" id="line1345"><a name="pos1345"></a>to cross-examine the applicant Mr du Plessis, and my submission </p>
<p class="line" id="line1346"><a name="pos1346"></a>is that there is no difference between Danster and Coetzee's </p>
<p class="line" id="line1347"><a name="pos1347"></a>position and if he has the opportunity to cross-examine the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1348"><a name="pos1348"></a>applicant I also want to be afforded the opportunity.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1349"><a name="pos1349"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Why did you not place yourself on record.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1350"><a name="pos1350"></a>ADV VALUS:   Mr Chairman everybody had an opportunity to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1351"><a name="pos1351"></a>speak and I did not want to intervene.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1352"><a name="pos1352"></a>ADV DE JAGER:   Did Danster apply for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1353"><a name="pos1353"></a>ADV VALUS:   No he did not apply for amnesty, no he did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1354"><a name="pos1354"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   On what basis do you want to put questions, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1355"><a name="pos1355"></a>your client hasn't applied for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1356"><a name="pos1356"></a>ADV VALUS:   Mr Chairman if Mr Coetzee will testify evidence </p>
<p class="line" id="line1357"><a name="pos1357"></a>will be led which will incriminate my client and the purpose of my </p>
<p class="line" id="line1358"><a name="pos1358"></a>cross-examination will be to test the value of the incriminating </p>
<p class="line" id="line1359"><a name="pos1359"></a>evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1360"><a name="pos1360"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Well if that happens then we will allow you to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1361"><a name="pos1361"></a>put questions at that stage.  If Mr Coetzee implicates your client </p>
<p class="line" id="line1362"><a name="pos1362"></a>then you will be afforded an opportunity to put questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1363"><a name="pos1363"></a>ADV VALUS:   Will that be only for Mr Coetzee then or will the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1364"><a name="pos1364"></a>other applicants be recalled.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1365"><a name="pos1365"></a>ADV DE JAGER:   The point is did any of these people or nobody </p>
<p class="line" id="line1366"><a name="pos1366"></a>said anything that prejudices your client.  He did not say Danster </p>
<p class="line" id="line1367"><a name="pos1367"></a>assaulted, he did not say your client did anything wrong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1368"><a name="pos1368"></a>ADV VALUS:   It was said by way of indication that my client is </p>

<p class="line" id="line1370"><a name="pos1370"></a>ADV DE JAGER:   Mr Roux our problem is that we have a role to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1371"><a name="pos1371"></a>fulfil or a task to complete before the 30th of June, and if we call </p>
<p class="line" id="line1372"><a name="pos1372"></a>everybody who says somebody else has told a lie we will never </p>
<p class="line" id="line1373"><a name="pos1373"></a>finish in time.  We will determine whether your client's role was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1374"><a name="pos1374"></a>so large or big that it's necessary that he's represented here and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1375"><a name="pos1375"></a>that he should be cross-examined.  We should reconsider this </p>
<p class="line" id="line1376"><a name="pos1376"></a>before we decide upon that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1377"><a name="pos1377"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Yes we will tell you that if your client had </p>
<p class="line" id="line1378"><a name="pos1378"></a>applied for amnesty obviously he has locus standi.  If your client </p>
<p class="line" id="line1379"><a name="pos1379"></a>was implicated by the applicants then you would have had a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1380"><a name="pos1380"></a>chance, on behalf of your client to show that your client was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1381"><a name="pos1381"></a>wrongly implicated.  You understand?  If Dirk Coetzee gives </p>
<p class="line" id="line1382"><a name="pos1382"></a>evidence, or if any other applicants give evidence and if they </p>
<p class="line" id="line1383"><a name="pos1383"></a>implicate your client then to the extent that your client may be </p>
<p class="line" id="line1384"><a name="pos1384"></a>implicated you may put questions but only to that extent.  You </p>
<p class="line" id="line1385"><a name="pos1385"></a>will not be allowed to traverse the entire spectrum of evidence </p>
<p class="line" id="line1386"><a name="pos1386"></a>that has been given.  It is only to the extent that your client may </p>
<p class="line" id="line1387"><a name="pos1387"></a>be implicated.  Do you understand?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1388"><a name="pos1388"></a>ADV VALUS:   As it pleases you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1389"><a name="pos1389"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   I forgot to take your name down, what is your </p>
