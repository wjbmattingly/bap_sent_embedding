<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> Mr Chairman, the Interpreter missed ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, I didn't hear that, he said he used to be Branch Chairman, then he was an Organiser and then he went on to say something else.  What was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> I am in the Region of PAC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What Region?</p>

<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And what position do you hold, if any?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> I am just an additional member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When did you stop being Branch Chairman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> That was the year before last.</p>

<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> I know him as a member of PAC who is in my Branch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> When did he become a member?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> He started in 1991, it was in June.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> Can you please tell ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How many people became members in June 1991?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> Many people, there are more than 500.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In June 1991?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And how many in July 1991?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> If I had books in front of me, I would be able to answer that question, if I had the data base with me.  I won't be able to estimate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How do you know that he became a member in June 1991?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> We do have a data base, we record each time a person is joining.  We write that in our roll book.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How do you know that he became a member in 1991?  Who told you that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> I looked at the data base, where there is an entry of each and every member's date of joining the Organisation.  There is even a card there that has got all the information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, do carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> During the time you were in office as the Branch Chairperson, as you were in office as Branch Chairperson, do you know whether there was any conflict in the area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> Yes, there was a conflict.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> Can you please very shortly and briefly, inform the Members of the Committee about that conflict?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> The conflict in the area, it started as if it was a domestic problem, but we realised that it was actually targeting the members of the PAC and they were hitting their houses also.  Hitting the houses of the PAC members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> Yes, can you please continue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Sorry Ms Goso, can I ask him, I think he was too fast for the Interpreter to pick up everything.  Can he repeat what he has just said, how this conflict started?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> This conflict started as a community problem, but after some time, it changed, the whole thing changed now because the members of PAC were being attacked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Attacked by who?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> We won't know because we used to say there were gangsters, because we couldn't see those people.  The only thing that was happening, our people were being attacked.  We couldn't see the people who were attacking them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Sorry Ms Goso, without interrupting you, can you recall who was attacked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> The people who were attacked there, the first person Elsie Mkumbusi's house was attacked and Mr Nyangweni's house was attacked.  Mr Makoeto's house was also attacked.  A gentleman from Siko family who was shot in the eye, he was from number 1749.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> And it is quite correct to assume that the members of the organisation were quite concerned about these attacks?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> From the very first day when these houses were attacked, I woke up in the morning, I phoned the Region.  I wanted to call the people there, I wanted them to come and see the damage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a>	The person from the Region came and I told Mr Deo also that our members were being attacked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Give me the name of this person, who was it that you talked to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> It was Deo Mabusela who was the Chairman of the Region at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did he come and see the damage that was done?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> The Organiser Michael Siolo came to check the damage on the very same day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I am sorry about that, I am not very familiar, give me the name again please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> Michael Siolo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What was he, what was his position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> He was the Organiser in the Region.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, he came to see the damage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> What about Mr Mabusela, did he come?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> He came later.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, do carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> When that happened, we submitted a report.  The Regional Chairman said he will try and look for people who will be able to handle that problem of our members who were being attacked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, do carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> He said he was going to meet with the High Commander of the Security, TF.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> Mr Sityodama, can you please explain to the Members of the Committee what you mean by TF, what does that acronym stand for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> That is a Task Force.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">DR TSOTSI:</span> Did you report to the Police at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">DR TSOTSI:</span> And what was the result?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> The Police came and inspected the damage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Which Police station was this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> Nyanga Police station.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Do you know the Police Officer who was investigating the matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> The Police that I knew there, was Carolus who was in the lower, he knows that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Tell us when was this.  When was this matter reported to this Policeman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> We reported the incident on the very same day, it was on a Sunday.  We were attacked on a Saturday evening, we woke up and reported the case the following day, that was on a Sunday morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, I want to know what month are we talking about, and what year.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> I can't remember the month.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you can't remember the year?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> If I am not mistaken, it was in 1991 because I became a Chairman in 1991.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> When did this incident that you are referring to, take place?  Can you remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Which incident are you talking about now Ms Goso?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> When this attack took place, that you have referred to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The one that was reported to the Police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> The one that was reported to the Police, can you remember when it took place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> I cannot remember the month, I cannot remember the month when this took place, but I think the Policeman who was handling the case, has got the date.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> How long after the incident had taken place, did you report it to the Police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> This took place on a Saturday evening.  We reported it the following day in the morning, it took place Saturday evening, and the following day, that was on a Sunday, we went to the Police station.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> Do you remember or can you, are you able to explain whether the Regional structure after you had reported to them, took any steps about this matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">DR TSOTSI:</span> Just before that, I think we took him off the trend.  He told us that they reported the matter to the TF, can he go along and tell us what happened as a result of that report?</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think that is the question, isn't it Ms Goso?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> If I can put it to him like that Mr Chairman.  Before we took you off the track and asked you about reporting to the Police, you were informing us that the members of the Regional structure to whom you had reported, undertook to report this to the Task Force.  Can you then continue to tell us what happened from there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> They said it is okay, he was going to refer the letter to the Task Force.  We were never involved thereafter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> What was the Task Force going to do about this matter, according to Mr Mabusela?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He said he would just refer it to the Task Force.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> To refer it to the Task Force so that the Task Force can do what about the matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> It is the Regional structure who knew what was going to happen, because all we knew was that the Task Force was there to protect the people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> I am not so sure Mr Chairman, if the Members of the Committee heard the last reply.  Perhaps the, if they haven't, perhaps the Interpreter can repeat it for the benefit of the Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, please repeat that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> After reporting the matter to the Regional structure, the Regional structure said they were going to refer the matter to the Task Force.  They never came back to us to tell us what happened to the letter, we don't know anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">DR TSOTSI:</span> You said that the Task Force was there to protect the people, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> I am saying the Task Force was protecting the people, so we did not have any idea of what was going to happen.  It is only the Regional structure who knew what was happening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, do carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> Did you at any later stage, come to hear what happened then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> I never heard anything concerning the party, but there were no accidents.  There were no attacks, it was quiet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When he said there were no accidents, he probably meant there were no incidents?  Is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> At that time, but after some time, there were some incidents, but just after that incident, it became quiet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> Do you know a man by the name of Depoutch Elese?</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> We know him.  I know him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> Do you know about an attack that took place in his house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> I heard that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> Do you know who attacked the house and why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When was this attack, do you know when the house was attacked in the first place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> I don't know when was the house attacked.  I don't even know the people who attacked the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What year?</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> I am just forgetting, I can't remember the year.  I am so forgetful.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> All right, I understand that.  You say that you don't know who attacked the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, do carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> Do you think there is any possible link between the attack in Depoutch's house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I don't think you should put that question, when he doesn't even know when it happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> He does not even know for that matter, who carried out the attack.  How is he going to drive the link?</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, I don't think you should put a question like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> The question is withdrawn Mr Chairman and Members of the Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> That is the end of the examination.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS GOSO:</span> .</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Mr Fortuin, have you any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR FORTUIN:</span> Yes Mr Chairperson.  Can you tell the Commission when you became a member of the PAC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> I started in 1960 when I was in the Gauteng Region, in the Gauteng Province.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> You then arrived in 1975 and I assume that you were always then a member of the PAC, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> In 1991, what position did you hold in the PAC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> I was a Branch Chairman at Crossroads.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> Excuse me, you initially indicated that you first became an Organiser of the PAC and then only you became a member of the, then you became Chairperson of the PAC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, my notes say that he used to be Branch Chairperson, in 1997 he became Organiser.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> That is correct.  Mr Chairperson, he indicated that in 1996, round about 1996 he became Chairperson of the Branch of the PAC.  He said the year before last, I became Chairperson of the PAC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Out it to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> Sir, in your evidence you said ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ask him when, because there seems to be some doubt as to whether he said it was in 1996.</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> When did you become Chairperson of the PAC Branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> I started in 1991, I became the Chairperson of the PAC.  The year before last, I became an Organiser of the Branch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> Excuse me sir, so I assume that since 1991 you were Chairperson of the PAC Branch of Crossroads and the surrounding areas, is that correct and then thereafter you became Organiser of the PAC, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You shake your head, what is the answer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> I agree, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That you were Chairperson from 1991 to 1996?</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> Sir, do you perhaps know Vuyisile Mketsu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> Yes, I know Vuyisile Mketsu.  He was a Treasurer of PAC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> And he was never a Chairperson as far as you know, from 1991 to 1996?  He was never Chairperson of the PAC, of that Branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> Yes, he became a Chairperson when we were renewing the Committee, he became a Chairperson after being a Treasurer, when they were renewing the Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> And do you know what year he became Chairperson of the PAC, of that Branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> Vuyisile Mketsu became the Chairman in 1996 because when he left the PAC, he was still a Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> I see.  So, it is not completely correct then that you were Chairperson of the PAC Branch from 1991 up to 1996?  There was a period that Mr Mketsu was also Chairperson of the PAC Branch, is that correct and you say from 1994?</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think in fairness, it could have happened during the year, isn't it?  It could have happened during the year in 1996, both Mketsu, he became Chairman, he ceased being a Chairman in 1996.</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> Mr Chairperson, if I understand his evidence correct, he became Chairperson of the PAC in 1991 up to 1996.</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> So for two years he also indicates that Mr Mketsu was Chairperson from 1994 to 1996.  So there were two Chairpersons in the Branch then for that two years, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did he say that Mketsu was Chairperson from 1994?</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> I can pose the same question to him again sir, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> All I heard is that he said he became a Chairperson in 1996.  Just clear that up please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> Firstly, in the PAC organisation, the Executive Committee sits for only 12 months and after that, it is renewed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The question is when did Mr Mketsu become Chairperson of the Branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> He started in 1996.  He used to be a Treasurer, he used to be elected as Treasurer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That is cleared up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> That is correct Mr Chairperson.  You say that you became a member of the PAC Region as well and now you were an additional member of the PAC Region, is that correct, the Western Cape?</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> In the Region, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> Sir, it is also very clear that you know exactly when the applicant, Mr Maduna became a member of the PAC because you clearly state it was 1991, June and you also say you know this because you had a look at the data of the Organisation, is that correct?  The data base?</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> Yes, that is correct.  Each and every year you've got to take a look at the data base.</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> I see.  When were you asked to do a search as to whether Mr Maduna was a member of the PAC or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> I was not requested, I was doing that because it was the end of the year, we wanted to check the members of the Organisation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> And do you know how many members joined the Organisation in 1991?</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> I responded to that question that I cannot estimate, not unless I have a data base in front of me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> Is it possible that you would be able to bring the data base to the Commission, if you are asked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> If that was required, I could have brought it here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> When you were asked to come and testify today, was it explained to you that the reason why you must come and testify today was to the membership of Mr Maduna, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> I was requested this morning at work, I didn't even know that I was to come here.  I am from work now.  They requested me from my work to come here as a person who was the then Chairperson of the Branch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> Do you know when you went through the data base, when was that, the end of last year you say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> Firstly, PAC's year ends in March.  Each and every April is the beginning of our new year, that is why we have to check on membership.</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> And you are quite sure, when you looked in March of this year, you saw that Mr Maduna became a member in June 1991, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> Yes, we look at all members.  Those who have renewed and those who have not.  Starting from 1991 when we started that Branch up to now, to check whether all our members are still renewing their membership and those who have failed to do so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, I think that the real question is that you last checked this in April this year, is that when you checked whether Mr Maduna was a member?</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> I checked all the members who have renewed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, no I am just saying that you checked this in April, that is the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> Yes, in April.</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> Do you know where the data base or the records of your members of the Branch here in Cape Town, is kept?</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> Our data base when we have done and finished, we send it to our Regional Office who sends it to the National Office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a>	We only are left with our roll book.  The data base when finished, is sent to the Regional Office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> And you are quite sure that the application forms and details and the information regarding Mr Maduna was sent to the National Office.  Where is your National Office?</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> The PAC National Office is in Johannesburg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> I see.  Now could you explain why - or let me rather rephrase the question, and you are sure all the details of the membership of Mr Maduna was recorded in the Cape Town Region and from the Cape Town Region all the details were sent to the National Office, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> It is the same with all members of the PAC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> Now, excuse me sir, can you explain a letter that was handed in on Tuesday, it comes from your Organisation, it is signed by Mr Louis Ngwenya and it says and maybe if my colleague can just, if she still has a copy of the  letter of the PAC, just ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you referring to Exhibit A?</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> That is correct, and it reads the Eastern Cape Provincial Executive Council has managed to retrieve from its files records confirming his party membership and as such assured me that he was a fully complacent member of the party.</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a>	Can you explain how it ends up that his membership and his details is in the Eastern Cape?</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> Firstly, as Mr Maduna is a member of the Task Force, any member of the Task Force in terms of the Organisation, joins and does not have a Branch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> You see sir, you have testified he became a member in 1991 in the Western Cape and I specifically asked you where is the details, where is his records, where is his membership and you said it is in the Western Cape and from here, it goes to the National Office, I assume in Johannesburg.  Why would the Eastern Cape now suddenly come up with his party membership?</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a>	We are not talking about the Task Force here, we are talking about his party membership.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> Mr Maduna joined here in the Western Cape at the Crossroads Branch and he was a member there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a>	But in terms of his duties under the Task Force, he has no Branch.  He attaches to any Branch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I don't think that we are talking about his position as a Task Force, you see, you might not be able to explain this letter, because you didn't write it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a>	We have a letter written by somebody called Mr Ngwenya, you see, and that letter says that the Eastern Cape Provincial Executive Council has managed to retrieve from their file, records confirming his party membership and has assured me that he was fully complacent member of the party.</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a>	You are being asked whether you can explain how it is that they say that he was a member of the Eastern Cape?  If you don't know the answer, then you just say I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> I do not know the answer to this question because I too know him as having joined at the Crossroads Branch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">DR TSOTSI:</span> Do new members of the PAC, are they issued with cards, membership cards?</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> As a new member, he gets a new card.  If he renews, he renews on that same card.</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Do those membership cards have numbers Mr Sityodama?</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> Yes, they have numbers ending with 2002.</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> When you checked your records in April, were you able to see what is his membership card number?</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> No, I did not see the number of his membership card.</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Just as a member of interest, are you able to say what your membership card number is?</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> His membership?</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Your membership card number, are you able to recall that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> No, I cannot remember it off hand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, do carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> So if you checked in April and you saw that Mr Maduna became a member in June 1991, you say those records are available, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> Correct, we do have a data base.</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> So, if Mr Maduna wanted to prove his membership to this Commission, it was the easiest thing to do to simply ask him family members to visit the Branch where the data is kept and get a copy of, or the original of that details which you have just spoken about, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> If the Committee thinks so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> Excuse me, that is not my question.  What I am asking you sir, is if it is so easily available that you were able to check in April and March and establish that Mr Maduna became a member in 1991, in June 1991, in fact to be specific, it means that that records are easily attainable, which means that Mr Maduna could have asked his Counsel or his family members or friends, to go to the PAC Branch and get a copy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I don't think it is fair to ask the question of him.  He doesn't take those decisions.  What his Counsel does or what he decides should be done, is hardly a matter for him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a>	That is a matter for argument.</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> I withdraw Mr Chairperson.  Just maybe just to say that if somebody wants to get detail of his membership, if he is a member of the PAC, and he wants to confirm that he is a member of the PAC, is it very easy for that person to go to the Branch and get the detail of his membership or is it a difficult process?</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> It is easy if you want to ensure that it proves that you are a member, to get those details from the Branch Executive.</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> Now coming to the conflict sir, you say the conflict started, the domestic problem which eventually became a problem that the PAC and its members were being attacked, started in 1991, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> Do you know of - was that the period as was commonly known in the Western Cape where the Witdoeke and the comrades were in conflict with one another, 1991?</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> The Witdoeke's period was in 1986, not 1991.</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> You say that the conflict started in 1991, and then PAC members were attacked.  Did these attacks take place from 1991 up till what year?</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> After the attacks stopped, the attacks resurfaced again in, now as they have now again been established, as we now have this problem of PAC members being attacked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When was that, when did they resurface?</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> The present ones started as the community problems being referred to by residents to the Council, but now what is happening is that we currently have four members of the PAC who have been killed, as I am speaking.</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> My question was, you see, there were these attacks which took place in 1991, you say then there was a period of quiet and you said that they resurfaced.  I want to know from you when did they resurface?</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a>	I am not talking about the day, I am talking about after 1991 they ceased, when did they commence again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> I think they started there around 1993, by the time Yster and Hlaheta were being shot at.</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> So you say the attacks first took place in 1991 and it resurfaced in 1993, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> So you are quite sure it is now 1993 and you are not thinking any more, but you are quite certain it is 1993?</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> You see, the reason why I think it was in 1993, I am just calculating the time we had the lull from 1991 and the time when the killings started again.  I think and become certain kind of, that it was 1993 the time that they resurfaced.</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> Do you perhaps know when the Task Team was formed of the PAC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The Task Force?</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> The Task Force, sorry?</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> No, I would not be able to know anything about that, I am not connected to those.</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> When did you report the incident, was it in 1991 when the Organiser said he would refer that to the Task Team, the Task Force, sorry?  So the Task Force was established in 1991, is that correct?  Or it was in existence in 1991, the Task Force?</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> I do not know when the Task Force was first established, but I know it is a long time that we had the Task Force around.</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> I just want to confirm that the Task Force was in existence in 1991, is that correct?  When you spoke to your Organiser, he said he was going to refer that to the Task Force, so in 1991 the Task Force was established already, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> It was yes, in existence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> Do you perhaps know if anything happened with the report that you gave the Police about the attacks in 1991?</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> Like what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> Do you know whether the people that were caught, or rather let me say do you know whether people were caught and arrested or prosecuted or do you know anything that happened of the incident that you reported to the Police, I assume in 1991?</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> I heard around about that, but I cannot tell myself.  I do not know directly as to that did happen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> May I ask you what did you hear?</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> That there were members who had been arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> Did that members belong to a political organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> Mr Chairman, if I may come in.  I am not so sure if there is not a misunderstanding.  If the question can be repeated to the witness to make sure that the reply that we get, relates to the same incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just clear that up.  Please listen to me.  After the house was attacked, the matter was reported to the Police, you reported it to your Branch.  The question is, did the Police do anything at all about it after it was reported?</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> On the side of the Police, nobody was ever arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> As far as you are concerned, nothing further happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> Can you tell the Commission when in 1993 did these attacks start again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> I would not be able to remember the month.</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> Excuse me sir, can we make it easier, was it in the beginning of the year, the middle of the year or the end of 1993?  You don't have to mention the month.</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> I think in the middle of the year.</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> Are you quite certain of that sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He just said he thinks.  There is hardly anything about certainty.  He doesn't know the month.  You asked him whether it was the beginning or the middle.  He thinks it was in the middle of the year, now how much further can you take that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> Did you also in 1993 report the attacks to the Police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> We did so.  We reported the matter to the Police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> Do you know who was responsible for the attack on Mr Depoutch Elese's house or his uncle's house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> I do not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> Can you tell the Commission where Mr Maduna lived before he was arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> As far as I know him, he used to stay at Nyanga.</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> And does Nyanga have a separate PAC Branch to the one of Crossroads?</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> Nyanga attaches to Crossroads because they do not have many members at Nyanga.</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> You also testified that you could not identify the people that was responsible for the attacks on PAC members, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You know it is not a question of identifying people, he does not know who attacked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> Maybe I can just rephrase Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> Do you perhaps know or was the group who attacked PAC members, identified as a specific group?  Do you know of any individuals that were identified that was involved in the attacks.  Do you know whether it was ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Too many questions.  One question at a time.  Just answer this.  Do you know who attacked the PAC members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That is the end of the matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> Lastly sir, when you - do the PAC support the application of Mr Maduna for amnesty and is there any statement as regards to the application of Mr Maduna that the PAC has produced regarding his application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> I would not know about the National Office because everything emanates from the National Office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> Therefore sir, do you have a mandate to testify on behalf of the PAC as to regards to the membership of Mr Maduna if everything emanates from the National Office?</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He was approached yesterday by the lawyer of Mr Maduna as a witness.  He says he has come from work, here and I can't imagine any formal decisions being taken at an organisational level for him to come and give evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a>	Now, if you are saying that he has no authority to talk on behalf of the PAC, then you must put it on that basis, no formal authority.  If that is what you are trying to say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> I take your point Mr Chairperson.  Maybe I should just rephrase that question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> Do you know whether in the National Office or in the Regional Office ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, let's put it this way, were you authorised, have you been authorised by the PAC to come and give evidence today?  Isn't that what you are trying to get?</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> Members of the PAC came, that is where I am going to go and give a report to when I leave here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  So were you, the question is have you been authorised and asked by the PAC to come and give evidence?  I think the lawyer wishes to know whether you are authorised by the PAC to come and give evidence, either yes or no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> I have no further questions, thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR FORTUIN:</span> .</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Have you got any questions to ask?</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Yes, just a few Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, certainly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> When did you as the PAC Branch have the data base?</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> We started to establish our data base in 1992.</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> And I take it that each and every Executive member of the Branch had access to the data base, is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> Yes, all Executive members have a right to look at the data base.</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Thank you, no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What work do you do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> At the Medical Centre at Elsies.</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> When you say in 1993 you reported, you say we reported the attacks to the Police.  Who is we who did that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> It was myself and other members of the Executive of the Branch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> You reported at the same Police station as the one you reported in 1991?</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> Yes, at Nyanga.</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> You mentioned some name of an Investigating Officer, was it the same Investigating Officer in 1993 who looked into these attacks?</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> We got a new Policeman to whom we then reported.</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Do you recall his name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> No, I do not know the new one.  I only know Mr Carolus.</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> You mentioned two names, I think you said it was Yster and Hlaheta who were shot.  Where were they shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> Yster and Hlaheta were shot inside Hlaheta's house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> What that at night, during the day?  Are you able to say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> It could have been about seven o'clock, after I had left them.  After they had gone inside the house, they were shot inside.  It was not late, it was not too late, it was about eightish, seven or eight at night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Was there any suspicion as to who could have shot them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is the use of that evidence if it is just a suspicion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> No, we had no suspicions as to who may have been responsible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> The people who were shot at the house of the Elese family, did you know them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> I know the mother whom I know for a long time.  The others I do not know very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> I take it that you will not be able to say whether those people had anything to do with the attacks on members of the PAC, would you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> I would not be able to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ms Goso, any re-examination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">RE-EXAMINATION BY MS GOSO:</span> Yes Mr Chairman, just two questions.  Do you know whether members of the PAC would support this application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> I am certain that members of the PAC would support his application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS GOSO:</span> .</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Why do you say that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> Because they know him as a member and would like him to be released and be amongst them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Is that the only reason for which you think they would support his application for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> That is the only reason that I can think of.</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">DR TSOTSI:</span> Apart from Mr Maduna, do you know any other members of the Task Force?</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> Yes, there are other Task Force members, though we do not know their real names.</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">DR TSOTSI:</span> Do you know Victor Sam?  I think I am correct, that is the name isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> I know him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">DR TSOTSI:</span> Was he a member of the PAC or of the ANC, do you know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> PAC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">DR TSOTSI:</span> PAC?  Do you know a man called Tinage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">DR TSOTSI:</span> Is he a member of the ANC or PAC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> He was a member of the PAC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">DR TSOTSI:</span> Until when or what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">MR SITYODAMA:</span> Tinage was later arrested in Transkei where he is currently serving his service.  Victor Sam is still a member and has just recently renewed his membership, two months back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">DR TSOTSI:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you very much, you are excused from further attendance.</p>

<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> We call Mr Vuyisile Mketsu to testify on behalf of the victims.</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Will you please stand.  Will you just spell your full names please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">VUYISILE MKETSU:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR FORTUIN:</span> Mr Mketsu, where do you live?</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> Crossroads, Unati area, number 1690.</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> When did you join the PAC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> In 1990.</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> Was there a Branch in 1990 in Crossroads?</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> No.  I was the man who tried to gather people around the PAC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> So is it correct then if I assume that you were one of the founder members of the Branch of Crossroads, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> Yes, I was the one who was a founder member of the Crossroads Branch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> What was your position which you held in 1990 with the establishment of the PAC Branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> I had no position.  I simply gathered people for the PAC.  I used cards or I was the one who was recruiting members into the PAC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> When the Branch was established, the PAC Branch in Crossroads, and the Executive of the PAC Branch was elected, what position were you given or elected in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> A Branch was elected in 1991, but because I was in possession of money as the original person who recruited members, I was made the Treasurer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> When people wanted to join the Organisation, would you be the person that they would first speak to and pay the membership fees and fill in the forms as Treasurer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> Yes, they came to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> And how long did you hold this position as Treasurer of the PAC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> I was Treasurer from 1991, 1992 and 1993.</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> Could you tell the Court who was Chairperson in 1991, 1992 and 1993?  Chairperson of the PAC Branch in Crossroads?</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> The Chairperson was Mr Sityodama and his vice was Mr Sdjale.</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> For my benefit please spell the names of the people that you have mentioned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> Sityda ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> Was that the Chairperson of the Branch in 1991 and is that the same person that testified just before this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> Not both names were spelt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> Sityodama was the first Chairperson of the PAC and then Galine later.</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> And the previous witness testified that he made sure of the fact that the applicant Mr Maduna, became a member in June 1991.  Do you know the applicant, Mr Maduna?</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> You see, the name Mr Maduna is very new to me.  I do not know who Maduna was as to how he looked even.  I do not know Maduna.</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> Are you quite sure that Mr Maduna was not a member of the PAC in 1991, 1992 or even in 1993 while you were Treasurer of the Branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> No, I never heard the name Maduna.  It is the first time that I get to know a person called Maduna.</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> Mr Mketsu, the previous person also testified that the PAC has got a data base.  Can you explain to the Commission how the collection, or what the data base is as you understand it and what happens to the data base or the numbers in terms of membership and monies and so on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> It is a roll call, kept by the Treasurer and the issuing of cards, and also the Secretary of the Branch who had the roll call.  That is the list of new members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a>	This data base word is new to me, I don't know its meaning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> If the data base was established in 1992, would you have known about it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> I am very unclear about the word data base, to me it is very new.  I do not know what it means.</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> Do you know when the Task Force of the PAC was established?</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where?</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> When?</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where?</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> No, I do not know much about, I don't know anything about the Task Force.</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> In the Western Cape I meant Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> The conflict of 1991, can you explain to the Commission what the conflict of 1991 in Crossroads was all about?  What was the reason for the conflict?</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> It was houses that Mr Nongwe was attacking.  He was the person who led people to attack houses to prevent people from going into those houses and using them as their own, that is occupying, as new occupiers of those houses, that was Mr Nongwe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> Was that also the case in 1992, 1993 and onwards?</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> It was the same, or the similar problem.</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> Do you know whether the PAC blamed gangsters for the attacks on the people in Crossroads?</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> I don't know anything about gangsters.  What I knew was that everybody who occupied a house at that place, was being attacked, regardless so that they could be driven out.  It was Mr Nongwe who did that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> When an attack occurred in Unati, who did the people suspect as being the perpetrators of the deed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> The suspicions of the people was that the attack at Unati must have been planned and executed from Section 4, that was what people believed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> The house of Mr Elese that was attacked in 1993, could we assume that the people also were under the impression that it was done by Mr Nongwe or the squatters in Crossroads?</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> People thought it was Mr Nongwe who initiated the attack or who instructed people to go and attack that house, and those who he led.</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> Do you know whether a person by the name of Tinage is a member of the PAC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, first of all does he know whether there is a person by that name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> Excuse me Mr Chairperson.  Do you know a person by the name of Tinage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> I only hear about the name Tinage, but I cannot point that person out.  I only hear about a person called Tinage, but my knowing Tinage, I take it that he is a taxi driver, he is a person who drives taxi's, but I won't be able to point him out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a>	In the PAC, no, I never heard of a person like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> Do you know whether Mr Victor Sam was a member of the PAC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> I know it is so that he was a member of the PAC from 1974.  I heard from them that he was a PAC member.  We used to hold meetings with him, general meetings.  He was not usually there, even when we went for elections, he was there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> Can I just repeat.  Did you say that Mr Victor Sam became a member in 1974 or 1994?</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> I am sorry in 1994.</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> Do you know whether Mr Victor Sam is still a member of the PAC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> I know that he is no more a member of the PAC.  I now know that he has joined the UDM, that is what I heard.  I have never met him, but that is what I got to know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> Do you know these attacks that took place in 1991 and 1993, if these attacks were ever reported to the Police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> What happened was that meetings, community meetings were held, Policemen were not involved.  People would sit down as the community to discuss as to what must be done as a community, as to how they can defend themselves.  That is all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> Just lastly, Mr Mketsu, do you know if there was any talk or rumours of gangsters attacking the PAC in 1991, 1992, 1993 for that three years?</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> No, I never heard such rumours about gangsters, that gangsters were attacking PAC members.  I never got to hear about such a thing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a>	I did not hear anything like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> I've got no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR FORTUIN</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you still a member of the PAC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> No.  I left them in 1996.</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ms Goso?</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a><span class="speaker">DR TSOTSI:</span> To what Organisation do you belong now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> I joined the ANC at the community, I am a Chairman of the Unit SANCO at Unati, SANCO Unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a><span class="speaker">DR TSOTSI:</span> When did you join the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> Then, 1996.  When I left the PAC, what happened that I left the PAC, I was at the rural areas at home, Emacoseni, I saw that I as the Deputy Chairperson of the PAC, I was elected as the vice and Goco was a Chairman and when we got the report, what made me to leave the PAC, it was RDP that was elected.</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a>	I was at the funeral, at my father's funeral at home and when I came back, I heard those news.  I told them that I agree with the decision about development, that development in Crossroads should go on just like in other places.</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a>	That actually caused a misunderstanding between myself and the members, and what actually, the thing that made me to be unsatisfied is because Mr Nongwe is not the member of the PAC, but he was there.  At the meeting I asked why was Mr Nongwe there, because he was not a member of PAC, then other members of the PAC disagreed with me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a>	Mr Nongwe ordered me to go out.  I left.  That is what made me to leave PAC as an Organisation.  PAC was not for development.</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> All right, right now we are concerned with other issues.  Can you proceed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS GOSO:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.  Mr Mketsu, you have proved yourself not to be, not to have been a loyal member of the PAC, haven't you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He showed you the reason for his disagreement with the PAC, if that makes him disloyal, he has a difference of opinion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> Can I rephrase Mr Chair?</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Please do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> Mr Mketsu, you are the sort of member who when you do not agree with policy, would break away from the Organisation, aren't you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> Yes, but with due respect ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> I am not that type of a member, I sat down, I called three meetings, trying to discuss with the members of the PAC.  Three times, discussing with the members of PAC because we would go to Site C and Langa and the PAC members in Langa and Site C and Harare, we used to visit them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a>	We would find them meeting, talking the same language, speaking the same language about dissatisfaction.  I sat in about three meetings with the PAC members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> And therefore Mr Mketsu, you are not happy with what the PAC did to you, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> I was not satisfied by what the PAC Branch did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> Here you were, you had dedicated so much time of your life, and here they are, they do not allow you to go and join the RDP, and that made you feel disgruntled, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> Yes, that is correct.  Certainly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> And in fact, you went and you aired your disgruntlement on air, is that not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> Where?</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> You spoke on air about your unhappiness about the decision of the PAC not to allow you to go and sit at the RDP, isn't it, on radio?</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> Are you talking about myself, yes, I did that.  But I started, I didn't go straight to the radio, I started discussing the matter with the PAC members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> In fact, these people so much made you angry, they suspended you, didn't they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> They made me very angry, because what I didn't like was the conflicts in our society being one nation, black people.  That made me very angry.  Most especially Mr Nongwe burnt down my house during those conflicts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a>	That actually made me very angry, that is why I took a decision that I would never sit with Mr Nongwe in a meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> Of course you have every right to be still angry with them.  Isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> I was forced because of the way I saw the whole situation, I looked at the whole situation because if we are discussing our own matters, there is no need to have another member from another Organisation.  I asked the PAC members why was Mr Nongwe there, I never got any answer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a>	Instead Mr Nongwe responded and he actually ordered me to go out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> These are all the things, a combination of all these factors that make you still feel quite angry with the Organisation, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> Yes, certainly.  Yes, that is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> Can we pass on.  Do you, what do you understand to be meant by a roll call?</p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> The roll call is for people who are at a meeting, it records how many members attended, how many members in a Unit and it also counts how many people who have joined the Organisation from the receipt book.  The receipt book and the roll call goes together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> And a roll call is some kind of document, yes or no?</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> It is a book.</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> And a book is a document, yes or no?</p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I don't think you should worry about that.  Nobody can disagree with that.  It is recorded in writing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> I take the point Mr Chairman, I am passing on to another point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> Now that you have since left the Organisation, you have no knowledge who keeps their documents containing membership, do you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> I had knowledge, when I became the vice Chairman, I handed over some of the things to the Committee, to Mr Goco who became the Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> I will repeat what I am putting to you.  Now that you are no longer within the Organisation, you have no knowledge who keeps this information containing names of members, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> I don't have any knowledge, I handed over to Goco.  I gave him everything about the membership because he was a Chairman at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a>	I left everything with him.  I was not handling anything because I became the vice Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> Mr Mketsu, when I consulted I was given names of houses of members of PAC that were attacked during the conflict and your name is amongst those people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a>	You were one of the people whose houses were attacked during that time, yes or no?</p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SANDI:</span> But he also said he believes his house was burnt by Mr Nongwe, Mr Nongwe attacked his house.  That was part of his evidence of that aspect?</p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> I am building up towards canvassing that point Mr Member.  There were other members of the PAC whose houses were attacked during that time, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> This seems to have been an attack not just on your house alone, but on a number of PAC members by people and my instructions are, these people were not known who they were, that is what the last witness has said.  Do you agree with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a>	A number of members of the PAC, their houses were attacked by - there was a combined attack during more or less the same time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> I agree with the statement that says that the houses were being attacked, but the attack was not directed to PAC.  I knew in my heart that the person behind these attacks, was Mr Jeffrey Nongwe and whatever was happening at the time, I knew very well that it was Mr Nongwe who was behind this whole thing of attacking the houses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you saying that the houses of people other than PAC were also attacked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> I am certain that it was not only, the attack was not directed to PAC members only.  Everyone at Unati area was attacked, everyone was being attacked, not only the PAC members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> Can you give us names of other houses?  I am sorry Mr Chairman, maybe the Interpreter is not finished yet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> Finished.</p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> Can you give us names of people that you know, whose houses were attacked during that time, who were not PAC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> I will talk about something that happened at that time.  I didn't take it as if it is happening to me because I was a member of the PAC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a>	I was the first person to be attacked, it was late in the night.  I can't recall the time, I phoned Mr Mageduka and I told him that my toilet window was hit.  Mr Mageduka came to my house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a>	While he was still inspecting this window, Mrs Mkumbusi phoned and she told us that she was being attacked in her house, but I didn't take this as the attack that was directed to PAC members.  I took this attack as if they were attacking the houses in general.</p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> My question was asking for just one thing, the names of other people, other than PAC members whose houses were attacked during that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> There were a number of people whose houses - I understand a number of people's houses were attacked.  Do you know the names of all the people, or do you just know that people's houses were attacked?  Do you know the names of all the people whose houses were attacked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> All I knew was that the houses were being attacked.  I don't know all the names of the people whose houses were being attacked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a>	All I knew was that there was a general attack on houses, on people's houses, not directed only to PAC members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> The majority of the names that you have mentioned in your evidence today, happens to be PAC members, yes or no?</p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> No.  I don't look at it that way, because there were a lot of people's houses that were being attacked.  I don't see it that way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> I am just saying in your evidence in court here, not in court, during this hearing here today, you have mentioned names of people whose houses were attacked during that time, and in the names that you have mentioned, the majority of those names are PAC members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> It was myself and Mangwanya, but I didn't see it as the attack that was directed at PAC people, because they were just hitting the houses randomly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a>	The reason for me to mention Mkumbisi's name, it is because she phoned me and she said she was also being attacked, just after my house was attacked.  I knew very well that she was a member of the PAC but I knew that she was not being attacked because she was a member of the PAC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a>	She was being attacked because she happened to be in the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> Do you know Ms Nyangweni?</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> I know Ms Nyangweni, but I didn't get her story in full, but I know her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> Do you know Noluyolo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can you spell that for me please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> Noluyolo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> I know her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> Do you know whether her house was attacked during that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> I am not sure, I did not hear anything like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> Do you know Mr Makoeto's sister, do you know that her house was attacked during that time?  She was attacked during that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> I won't say at that time, because the battle of the houses started in 1991 and it was quiet in 1992 and then it started again in 1993, but I can't actually specify what period it was, but I heard something like that, but I am not sure whether it happened during the first conflict or the second one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a>	Because even then they were just attacking randomly, they were not selecting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> And of course you know that she was a PAC member?</p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> I know that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You are not suggesting that PAC houses exclusively were attacked, are you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> My instructions are that there was an attack on PAC members' houses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Exclusively?</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> Yes, a concerted effort.</p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I am not talking about concerted, I am talking about exclusively?  In other words only PAC members' houses were attacked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> Those are the instructions that I have.</p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That is what I want to know, whether that is what you are putting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> Yes, that is what I am putting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, do carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> Now, when you were Treasurer in your Branch, how many members did the Organisation have?</p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> We used to appoint the Branch, we used to hold election when we had 50 members.  We never have elections if we had something less than 50.  That was the policy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, that is not the question.  Please answer the question.  When you were the Treasurer, how many members were there in your Branch?  If you can answer the question, please tell us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> I had 50 members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> Exactly 50 and this was in 1996?</p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> In 1996 there were 50 members, there were 50 members.  The number was 50.</p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> How do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> I remember that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> What makes you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> We wouldn't have elections if we don't have 50 people, if we didn't have 50 people, we wouldn't have elections.</p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> You are ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You are not very helpful.  It is not how many members you have to have before you have elections.  The question is did you not have more than 50 members, or is it just 50 members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> Those that I noticed in 1996, 50 members, it is only 50 members that we had.</p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> There maybe others which you do not remember, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line546"><a name="pos546"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How do you answer a question like that?  There may be others, but you haven't mentioned any names, so how would he know if there were others?  He has just mentioned the number.</p>
<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> He has mentioned in his reply, I don't know because I have not been listening to the translation, but in Xhosa, what he was saying was that he only remembers 50 and my question followed as a result of his response to an otherwise simple question of how many members were there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line548"><a name="pos548"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were there not more than 50 members in 1996?</p>
<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> I can't be so sure about that, but the only thing that I know is that the number had reached 50.</p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a>	There were not less than 50, that I am sure about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> Do you have a good recollection who those members were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> No.  I cannot recall but I used to know them, because I was staying with them at Crossroads.</p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> Mr Mketsu, I don't think you are really doing justice to my question.  I want to know if you, out of the 50 members that you know that were there, you have a good recollection of who they were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you want to know whether he knows the name of the 50 people, is that what you are asking?</p>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> Yes Mr Chairman, in order to be able to say X couldn't have been amongst that 50.</p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Let's ask him, do you know the names of all the 50 people, or did you just know them by sight?</p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> I used to know them by sight.  I knew their names also by seeing them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is this relevant, because this is talking about 1996?</p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> That was a mistake.  I want to put the same question in relation to 1993, that was a slip on my part.  I aimed at 1993.</p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ask him that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  How many members did your Branch have in 1993?</p>
<p class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> In 1993 my Branch had 50 members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> So, Mr Mketsu, this membership was not growing.  In 1993 the members were 50, 1994, 1995, even in 1996, the number of the membership was 50?  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> The number was growing, but I can't tell you now how many members were there, but there were above 50.  The only thing that I noticed was that the number had reached 50.  That is the only thing I could notice.</p>
<p class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> In 1993 in particular, it could have been more?</p>
<p class="line" id="line566"><a name="pos566"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> That might be the case, but all I know is that all that was on my mind was that at least we had 50 members, and if we had 50 members, at the end of the year we change them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a>	We wouldn't change the members if we didn't have 50.</p>
<p class="line" id="line568"><a name="pos568"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> And amongst these members, who could have added up to this 50 - these are people that you have no independent recollection of who they were, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a><span class="speaker">DR TSOTSI:</span> Ms Goso, do you want to know really who, whether so and so was there as a member.  Why don't you go straight to it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line570"><a name="pos570"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> Mr Mketsu, you have said that Mr Maduna was not a member in 1993.  If you did not have an independent recollection of all the members, how can you be sure that he was not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> What made me to be sure of that is because today it is the first time that I hear that name here.  I used to take note of people's names and I knew their faces also.</p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a>	I can even tell you that that was so and so.  The people, all the people who were in my Branch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> Finally ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a><span class="speaker">DR TSOTSI:</span> Have you seen Mr Maduna today, the man called Mr Maduna?  Is he here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> I won't tell anything about Mr Maduna.</p>
<p class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a><span class="speaker">DR TSOTSI:</span> Well, you might know him by another name.  Can he stand up?  Is he here?  Do you know that man?</p>
<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> This is my first time to see that face.</p>
<p class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> Finally Mr Mketsu, I just want to ask one question, were you told in whose matter you were going to come and testify here today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> No.  I was not told about Maduna's application, but I got a message from a child that I am being requested to come to the Truth Commission.  It is a child who brought that message to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> Finally and in conclusion, I want to put it to you that not only do you have an independent recollection whether Mr Maduna was a member or not, but also you are also a disgruntled ex-member of the PAC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That is argument, isn't it?  That is hardly evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> I beg your pardon Mr Chairman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I say that is argument, that is not evidence.  You can make that submission when the time comes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line585"><a name="pos585"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> No further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line586"><a name="pos586"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think what you are really trying to say is Mr Maduna, I am sorry the evidence you are giving here today is because you are disgruntled with the PAC and you are giving evidence against it.  That is what you are trying to say, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> Yes, if I can put that to him and get what his response is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line588"><a name="pos588"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  You see, it is being put to you that you are not impartial, you are giving evidence because you are unhappy, you are disgruntled with the PAC and that is the only reason why you are giving the evidence you give.</p>
<p class="line" id="line589"><a name="pos589"></a>	That is what Counsel is trying to put to you.  Have you anything to say about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKETSU:</span> I can't even comment on Mr Maduna's case.  I don't know Maduna.  I don't even know that name, it is for the very first time that I hear about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay.  Anything else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> No further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line593"><a name="pos593"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS GOSO</p>
<p class="line" id="line594"><a name="pos594"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Have you any questions to ask?</p>
<p class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Thank you Chairperson, no questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line596"><a name="pos596"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Fortuin, any re-examination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line597"><a name="pos597"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> None at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line598"><a name="pos598"></a>NO RE-EXAMINATION BY MR FORTUIN</p>
<p class="line" id="line599"><a name="pos599"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Have you any questions?  Yes, thank you very much, you are excused from further attendance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line600"><a name="pos600"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line601"><a name="pos601"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you calling any further witnesses?</p>
<p class="line" id="line602"><a name="pos602"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> No further witnesses Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line603"><a name="pos603"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you calling any witnesses?</p>
<p class="line" id="line604"><a name="pos604"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> No sir, there is no further evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line605"><a name="pos605"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> My Committee has been thinking about whether a man whose name has been mentioned here in connection with the murders that took place, Tinage, apparently it is known, it seems, that he is serving a term of imprisonment at some place or the other, his name - we are told what his name is, it may not be the same Tinage, it may be somebody else, but assuming it is the same person, is he not an implicated person and ought notice not to be served on him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line606"><a name="pos606"></a>	Have you any views on that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line607"><a name="pos607"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> He definitely qualifies as an implicated person Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line608"><a name="pos608"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, in terms of the Act I think, I think in terms of the Act, we are obliged to serve a notice on him, don't you think so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line609"><a name="pos609"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> I am not so sure whether that is a discretionary matter or an obligation matter.  Maybe the leader of evidence can assist in that regard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line610"><a name="pos610"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Yes Chairperson, in terms of Section 19(4) of the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act, the Commission, we are enjoined to notify him as an implicated person.  In fact Chairperson, had we known beforehand what his uncoded name is, we would have notified him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line611"><a name="pos611"></a>	The problem that led us in not notifying him was that at that moment sir, we did not know his uncoded name, we only knew the name Tinage.  But now that we had the benefit of knowing who actually Tinage's full names are, I think we are obliged to notify him sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line612"><a name="pos612"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Fortuin, have you any views on that matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line613"><a name="pos613"></a><span class="speaker">MR FORTUIN:</span> I would go along with my colleagues Mr Chairperson, that certainly Tinage is being implicated, and therefore I think he is entitled also to respond or to the audi alteram partem rule should apply here, that he be given an opportunity also to say whether he is part of this conspiracy or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line614"><a name="pos614"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> If I can come in Mr Chairman.   Tinage qualifying as he may be as an implicated person, I do not know whether there is an obligation on the Committee to hear his matter jointly, together with ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line615"><a name="pos615"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, implicated means he is afforded an opportunity to clear his name, if he chooses to.  In other words we are not calling upon him to apply for amnesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line616"><a name="pos616"></a>	No man can be compelled to apply for amnesty.  If Tinage did not apply for amnesty, it is too late in any case at this stage for him to apply.  It is merely to afford him an opportunity as an implicated person, to clear his name or to comment on it if he chooses to.  That is the, as I understand it, the provisions of that Section.</p>
<p class="line" id="line617"><a name="pos617"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> Yes Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line618"><a name="pos618"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, okay.  Yes?  My colleague tells me that even on your affidavit the name Victor Sam appears.</p>
<p class="line" id="line619"><a name="pos619"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> Yes, it does Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line620"><a name="pos620"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Not your affidavit, the affidavit of the applicant, as a person who came with a bag which contained weapons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line621"><a name="pos621"></a><span class="speaker">MS GOSO:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line622"><a name="pos622"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And to that extent he may be an implicated person as well.  The Committee will take an appropriate decision in the matter, after having given it due consideration.	If it comes to the conclusion that there is no need to serve this notice, if it does come to that conclusion, then we will proceed with considering the evidence and coming to a decision on this application. 	If we come to the conclusion that we are obliged to serve notices on implicated persons, we will hold back our decision and in due course, you will be informed and you Mr Fortuin, you will be informed of our decision.</p>
<p class="line" id="line623"><a name="pos623"></a>	Is there anything else that you wish to add at this stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line624"><a name="pos624"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> No sir, there is nothing more.</p>
<p class="line" id="line625"><a name="pos625"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Very well, the Committee will now adjourn.  We have come to the end of these proceedings, for the time being at any rate.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line626"><a name="pos626"></a>HEARING ADJOURNS</p>
