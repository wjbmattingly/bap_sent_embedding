Drie van die Swart mans is na 'n polisie optrede hier geskiet.  By hierdie Swart man kan ook 'n handgrenaad by sy linker arm gesien word.  Een van die ander Swart mans kan gesien word by 'n wit Kombi voertuig.  Die voertuig waarin Kaptein Brazelle en Sersant Andrich Grobbelaar gery het, daar was op hulle gevuur met 'n AK47 geweer.  Die koelgate kan hier baie duidelik in die voorruit van die voertuig gesien word.\n\t\tDie Swart man met die AK47 geweer, kon gesien hoe hy magasyne het wat aanmekaar vasgesit is sodat hy 'n redelike groot hoeveelheid rondtes by hom gereed kan he.  Die persoon le ook op die oomblik met 'n handgrenaad onder hom.  Daar is altesaam agt AK47's magasyne.  Dit is ook die persoon wat, na beweering, op die polisie voertuig geskiet het.  Daar kan gesien dat daar nog steeds in een van die magasyne AK47 rondtes is.  Die person het vanuit die rigting van die brug afgehardloop en op een van die voertuie begin skiet.  Hy het in die hardloop gevur en daar is vanuit die bosse deur die polisie op hom gevuur.  \n\t\tSersant Andrich (...indistinct) wys nou hier van die AK47 se doppies waar dit hier in die pad le.  Die persoon het alskietende oor die pad gehardloop.  \n\t\tNog een van die Swart mans by die voertuig waarmee hulle gery het.  Hulle voertuig leier oop hierdie oomblik nog steeds.  \n\t\tDie voertuig waarmee hulle gery het, die registrasie nommer tans op hierdie voertuig, Charlie Alpha 439417.  Die voertuig wat deur die lede van die Veiligheidspolisie bestuur was, jy kan duidelik gesien word hoe daar ook op hierdie voertuig gevuur is.  Selfs die knip van die regter voordeur is afgeskiet in die proses.  Die veiligheidsvoertuig uit 'n ander hoek afgeneem.  Daar was ook 'n handgrenaad na hierdie voertuig geslinger.  Die handgrenaad het ontplof.  \n\t\t'n Vierdie Swart man wat deur Adjudant-Offisier Moggee geskiet is nadat hy hierdie vuurwapen op hom getrek het.  Die Swart man net uit 'n ander hoek geneem met die punt 38 revolver nog steeds op sy maag.  \n\t\tNog een van die Swart mans, sowat 200 meter van die toneel van die handgrenaad gegooi is hier in die veld in die rigting van die spoorwegstasie.  \n\t\tWaar die twee lede nou aangestap kom is die plek waar die hangrenaad gegooi was.  Alhowel hierdie voorval om omgeveer 07H20 na 07H25 gebeur het en die tyd nou 07:56 is, word daar nog steeds uit die bosse op die polisie gevuur.  \n\t\tDit is nog een van die Swartes wat die bosse ingehardloop het en net deur die polisie aangekeer is.  Op die oomblik is die optog nog aan die gang en lede van die SAP besig om die bos te vee.  \n\t\tDit kan gesien word dat hierdie bosse reedelike ruig is.  Nog een van die Swartes.  Die Tokarev Pistool le nog stees lanks hierdie Swarte.  Swarte nou veereens duidelike deur die bosse se pad.  Kan nog steeds baie duidelik gesien word, bloed aan die takkie voor die boom soos hy deurgeval het en die Russiese 7,62 Tokarev Pistool langs hom.  Nog steeds hier met hierdie bosse reedelik ruig is.  Hierdie bos is sowat drie na 400 meter vanaf die eintlike toneel waar die meeste skietery plaasgevind het.  Op die oomblik is hier 'n totaal van sewe Swartes wat gedood is.  \n\t\tKasper voertuig kan hier gesien word waar hy bykans versteek is in die bos.  Die plek waar die handgrenaad ontplof het kan 'n baie duidelike wit kol op hierdie sementagtige oppervlak gesien word.  \n\t\tDie ondersoek beamptes het nou aan ons hierdie gat uitgewys en gese dat dit nou die gat is waar die handgrenaad geval het.  Die hefboom van die handgrenaad sowat twee en 'n half meter vanaf die gat waar die grenaad ontplof het.  Van die AK doppies nou hier in die pad nou uitgemerk.  Nog van die AK47 rondtes wat hier in die pad afle.  Die pad, in hierdie geval, NY1, Guguletu.  \n\t\tDie lede van die Veiligheidspolisie gaan nou probeer om die Swart man wat voor ons le om te rol deur van 'n tou gebruk te maak aangesien daar vermoed word dat hy op 'n handgrenaad le.  \n\t\tOns staan hier by Sersant Bellingan wat ook by hierdie operasie betrooke was.
