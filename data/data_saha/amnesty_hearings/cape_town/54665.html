<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   You are reminded that you are still under your </p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a>formal oath.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a>FRANCISCO CERQUEIRA:	(s.u.o)</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Arendse?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a>CROSS-EXAMINATION BY ADV ARENDSE:   (cont)  </p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a>	Thank you Mr Chairman.  Good Morning Mr Cerqueira.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Good morning Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Mr Cerqueira, yesterday at the outset I said to </p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a>you and I just want to repeat that today, that what happened that </p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a>evening, cannot be defended, it is indefensible, the killings of </p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a>everybody in that Tavern and the killing of your brother, constitutes </p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a>a gross human rights violation, there is no argument about that, so I </p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a>don't have any fight with you about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a>	So, just in terms of the necessary sensitivity which this matter </p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a>and which this process warrants, I just want to assure you of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   I appreciate that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   But you will also appreciate that we need to get </p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a>as full a picture as possible of what happened there and at times, </p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a>you know, I am going to put things to you which you know, which </p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a>obviously you may not agree with and which you may not like, but </p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a>like with everyone else, I've got a job to do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Now one of the things I put to you yesterday, </p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a>which may have caused some consternation or which may have upset </p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a>you, is the suggestion that you may not have been there.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a>	Now, none of us and I am sure Mr Prior will also tell you </p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a>that, we as lawyers we cannot make suggestions to you if we don't </p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a>have some basis for making them.  If they are purely speculative or </p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a>unfounded, then we are out of order and I am sure that the Chairman </p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a>will come to your assistance or will rebuke me if I do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a>	So yesterday's suggestion from me comes out of the summary </p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a>of the evidence that the Judge made in the criminal trial.  And that </p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a>comes from Mr Brode's evidence.  Mr Brode, I read back to you that </p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a>he said he was there, Mr Cerqueira's wife was there I think and some </p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a>other waiter, he never mentioned your name.  That is where it comes </p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a>from.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Did he mention Mr Cerqueira's wife was there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Sorry, let me just get it.   It is on page 46.    He </p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a>said and you understand Afrikaans - from line 22 Mr Chairman - he, </p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a>with Jose Cerqueira and his wife as well as another waiter stayed </p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a>behind after all the guests left the restaurant at about quarter past </p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a>eleven.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Well, Sir, there seems to be a little bit of a </p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a>misunderstanding.  Whoever gave you that statement, my brother's </p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a>wife was not in the restaurant at the time of the shooting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Okay, so Mr Brode made a mistake, it is not </p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a>Jose's wife, it was you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   I don't know how he made that mistake, but I </p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a>don't want to sound funny, but I don't look like a woman for </p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a>starters, and she is definitely very much a woman.   She was </p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a>definitely not there, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   So, you know, as far as we are concerned, we </p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a>accept that you were there, we don't have a problem with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a>MR PRIOR:   Mr Chairman, may I be of some assistance.  I don't </p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a>want to interject unnecessary, but the statement of Brode or </p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a>submissions of Brode on page 73 of the witness' bundle, which was </p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a>supplied to the legal representative where he describes the incident </p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a>in that statement, maybe that may assist my learned friend.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a>	The middle paragraph, under the heading "The incident".  </p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Thank you.  I have just indicated that it was not </p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a>in issue that Mr Cerqueira was at the scene.  Mr Cerqueira, just </p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a>going back to what you said then yesterday, all this happened very </p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a>quickly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   We are talking about the matter of a couple of </p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a>minutes at most?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   The time seemed like an hour to me, but it was </p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a>very quick.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Yes, yes.  When you came out of the restaurant </p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a>the first time, did you observe anyone else or anything else in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a>vicinity of the corner there where you were at, at the corner of </p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a>Lower Main Road and Station Road or in Station Road itself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   No, when I came out, Mr Brode was standing </p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a>on the corner in front of me and then the other waiter that worked </p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a>for us, came and stood with us.  That is the first observation of any </p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a>person around me, if you are talking about people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   And the second time you came out, did you </p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a>observe anything or anyone?</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   There was no second time.  It was the first time </p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a>I came out before the shots had been fired at us.  I came out onto </p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a>the pavement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   The two gentlemen I mentioned was standing </p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a>there, we looked up and the car was coming down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   But didn't you say you went back in after that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   When they started shooting at us, yes, I ran </p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a>back in, I dragged Mr Brode in.  We struggled through the door and </p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a>then I came out.  After - like I mentioned to you yesterday - after </p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a>going over the counter, looking for the gun, shouting for my </p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a>brother, then I came out and he was lying on the pavement.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Okay, that is the second time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   That is the second time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Okay, now the first time, apart from seeing Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a>Brode and the other waiter there on the pavement, and you dragging </p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a>Mr Brode in, you didn't see anything else or anyone else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   I am not sure what you are asking me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   No, I mean did you see another vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Are you talking about when I was inside the </p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a>restaurant or outside or ... (intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   No, when you came out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   When I came out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Yes, you came out now twice, okay, we know </p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a>that. </p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   I came out once first, I saw the two gentlemen </p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a>standing there.  I looked up and I saw one vehicle coming down.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a>didn't notice any other vehicle.  And when the shots were being fired </p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a>at me, believe you me, I didn't notice anything else, I  just noticed </p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a>to get out of there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   I understood you to say yesterday, that you came </p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a>out a first time and you saw what you called a heavy laden vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   No Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Move up against the one way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Mr Arendse, I think you are a little bit mistaken </p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a>there.  What I said yesterday was that when I was inside the </p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a>restaurant, the car - I noticed the car, if I turned to the door, I </p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a>noticed a car driving, slow down.  While I was sitting in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a>restaurant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Okay, okay, that is fine.  Then I was mistaken.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Okay, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   But you then only came out twice?  Once ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Once to find out what the popping sounds were </p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a>about and then when I ran in, then I came out - looking for my </p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a>brother.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   And then when you observed this vehicle again, </p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a>it was now coming in your direction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Whereas when you were sitting ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   In the opposite direction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Yes, when you were sitting in the restaurant, you </p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a>saw it going that way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Going up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   And that was a matter of minutes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   The interim?</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Now, when you came out the second time, did </p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a>you observe any other vehicle or any other persons in the street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   No, Sir.  At the time there was so much fear </p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a>and so much confusion, I was only concerned for my brother and I </p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a>went straight onto the pavement where my brother was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   He was actually in the gutter, not on the </p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a>pavement.  That is the second time when I came out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Okay.  Now, the first time you went out and you </p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a>pulled Mr Brode in, what did you see?</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   The first time when I went out and pulled Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a>Brode in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   When you went out and pulled Brode in, yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   I went out, I saw Mr Brode standing there with </p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a>the waiter and then the gunshots were being fired at us.  I looked </p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a>up, it was the same vehicle.  It looked to me like the same vehicle, </p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a>the same dark vehicle, I can't put a colour to it, it was coming down </p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a>in the opposite direction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a>	The same type of vehicle, the nose was up in the air, like this </p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a>and the people were firing at us.  That is the second time I went out. </p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a> I dragged Mr Brode in because he froze in the doorway, he had </p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a>been shot in the leg and against the wall, the first shots hit the wall. </p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a> That's when I dragged him in with fear, I went through.</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Did you see anyone in front of the Tavern?</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   In front of my Tavern?</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   No, in front of the Heidelberg Tavern when you </p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a>... (intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Did I see anybody?</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   I can't say I did.  I can't say I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   You were looking at the car because shots were </p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a>coming from the car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Correct Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   You were focused on the car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   I was focused on the car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Okay.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Mr Arendse, in circumstances like that when </p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a>you are being shot at, there is not many things that you can observe, </p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a>other than look out for your safety.  And I was looking out for Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a>Brode's safety as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Yes.  No, I understand.  Now, so at which point </p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a>then did you, you said yesterday that you saw someone at - it </p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a>sounded to me that someone sitting at the back, firing at that side of </p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a>the road, or firing towards the opposite side of the Heidelberg </p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a>Tavern and Machados?</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   When I came out and stood with Mr Brode </p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a>before they started shooting at us, the shots of gun and I saw the </p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a>one barrel being stuck out, sort of out of the roof like this, and the </p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a>person's head from the back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a>	And then another guy on the right hand side of the car, sorry </p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a>the left hand side of the car, shooting towards us.  They weren't </p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a>shooting direct at us at first, they were shooting like sort of at an </p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a>angle straight at the wall.  And then the guy turned the gun on us </p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a>and started shooting, that is when I grabbed and ran inside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Yes.   </p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   The car was travelling very, very slowly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Yes.  Maybe I can tell you that there was </p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a>someone on the corner of Lower Main Road and Station Road.  It </p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a>seems that more or less the same time that you observed what </p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a>happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a>	I will read to you from page 45 of the record and page 46 Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a>Chairman, from lines 22 onwards.  An employee of the Cape Town </p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a>City Council, John Jacobs, was on duty that Thursday evening of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a>30th of December 1993.  He was patrolling the streets to see </p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a>whether all the street lights were burning.  He and a colleague were </p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a>driving alone Lower Main Road in Observatory from north to south. </p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a> As they arrived at the corner of Lower Main Road and Station </p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a>Road, they heard sounds like gun fire or fire crackers and saw three </p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a>men emerge.  Since they wanted to turn into Station Road, they saw </p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a>three men in a car, against the one way, in Station Road, driving in </p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a>their direction.  They were then forced to wait for this motor </p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a>vehicle.  Mr Jacobs heard gun shots at the very moment when </p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a>someone emerged from the door of the facility on the corner of </p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a>Station Road and Lower Main Road.  He saw the end of a rifle </p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a>sticking slightly out of the back passenger window of the vehicle.  It </p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a>was clear to him that someone was firing from the motor vehicle at </p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a>this person.  He had fallen flat in his motor vehicle and then when he </p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a>lifted his head again, he saw the person who had emerged from the </p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a>door of the corner facility lying in the storm water drain in Station </p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a>Road.</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a>	Now, that version doesn't exactly correspond with what you </p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a>observed, do you agree with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a>MR PRIOR:   With respect, that is not so and I must object.  In the </p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a>summary given by the learned Judge it is connected by the witness </p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a>Jacobs to the firearm he sees protruding, or the barrel he sees </p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a>protruding out of the vehicle.  He links that firing with that firearm. </p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a> He doesn't say that the man who was shot at, was in fact firing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Is that so, Mr Arendse?</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Mr Chairman, can the witness just comment.  It </p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a>is not a trick question.  I have just read to him what Mr Jacobs said </p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a>and I am asking him whether that corresponds with what he has told </p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a>us.  That is all, I have made no suggestions or allegations that shots </p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a>may have been fired from the person on the corner, and this would </p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a>have been your brother Mr Cerqueira.  I made no suggestions.  I am </p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a>just asking for your comment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   I want you to know that what Counsel has read </p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a>out to you, is the Judge's summary of the evidence that was led </p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a>before him on this aspect of the matter.  Do you understand?</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   And you are invited to comment on that passage </p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a>that has been read to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   I have got no comment Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Thank you.  Now, just on the issue of the gun, </p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a>your brother's gun in this case.  Is it correct, you can't tell us apart </p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a>from saying to us that the Police, or a policeman looked at the gun </p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a>and said that no shots were fired out of the gun, you cannot say </p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a>under oath whether or not your brother fired a shot or shots at any </p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a>of the Heidelberg attackers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   He has said under oath that his brother didn't </p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a>have a gun.  That he went to where his brother's body was, and he </p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a>didn't have a gun.  Hasn't he, isn't that the evidence he gave </p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a>yesterday?</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   No, I didn't understand it to be that clear Judge, </p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a>with respect.  What we heard yesterday and Mr Cerqueira is here to </p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a>correct me, is that some time afterwards, it may have been five to </p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a>ten minutes after the late Mr Cerqueira was picked up from the </p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a>pavement, Mr Brode produced the gun to the Police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   No Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   His evidence was that he picked up this bag on </p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a>the pavement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   His evidence was he went to his brother how </p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a>was shot under the left arm.  He had no firearm, he had a bag in his </p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a>hand.  Wasn't that your evidence yesterday?</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Mr Cerqueira, did you see a gun?  Did you see </p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a>your brother's gun?</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Mr Arendse, like I've just told you, like the </p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a>Judge has told you, I didn't see no gun.  When I got to my brother's </p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a>body, he was lying there, he was choking in his blood.  I found the </p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a>pouch that I produced yesterday next to his body and there was no </p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a>gun there.  The gun was later given to me by Mr Brode, to my hand. </p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a> I held it in my hand.  The Police arrived, asked me if there was </p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a>shots being fired by the same gun, I said no, please check it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a>	The Policeman checked it, took it, gave it to another </p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a>Policeman, he made a statement which I didn't.  I didn't make any </p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a>statement, he made some sort of statement.  He wrote on the thing </p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a>and they took the gun.  I don't know what happened to the gun </p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a>afterwards to be quite honest with you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Yesterday I read Mr Brode's, the summary of his </p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a>evidence to you.  Do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   I do remember Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   And he mentioned nothing about the pouch or </p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a>the bag which you produced here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Or the gun?</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Well, he spoke about the gun and I recall saying </p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a>it is unfortunate that it is just left at where he said and I quote on </p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a>page 47 on the top.  "He called to Cerqueira to take his firearm in </p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a>hand which he kept behind the bar counter.  He then realised that </p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a>Cerqueira was not in the restaurant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a>	That is all he says about the gun.</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   He is quite correct, that is what he did.  He </p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a>went in shouting with me, we were both shouting for the gun.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a>shouted at Mr Brode, get Joe, get my brother and he was shouting </p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a>for my brother as well.  That is quite correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   So is it unreasonable to infer from what one </p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a>reads there, that your brother may have left with the gun or that </p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a>when he looked under the counter, there was no gun, you brother </p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a>wasn't there and he had run out with the gun?</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Mr Arendse, isn't it also reasonable to believe if </p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a>one had a gun in his hand and he is being shot and he is dying on the </p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a>pavement, that the gun would be lying next to him?  I found no gun </p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a>next to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Someone else may have picked up the gun?  Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a>Brode may have picked up the gun.  How do you know that he didn't </p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a>pick up the gun?</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Mr Brode got to the body after me, I was there </p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a>first.  I got to the body, my brother was lying there, choking in his </p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a>blood.  Mr Brode came up to me and asked me is he gone?  What's </p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a>wrong and he sat on the pavement, put his head in his hands and he </p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a>started crying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Now, unfortunately Mr Brode had already made a </p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a>mistake by mentioning Mr Jose Cerqueira's wife, but is he also </p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a>making a mistake by not - if obviously assuming the Judge's </p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a>summary is correct - is he making another mistake by not mentioning </p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a>that you were there first - by not mentioning you at all? </p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a>	One gets the impression from reading this that he was the only </p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a>one who got to your brother, picked him up, held his head in his </p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a>arms.  He doesn't mention you at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Sir, with due respect to the statement you've </p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a>got there.  That you will have to ask Mr Brode.  Like I mentioned to </p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a>you, I was there first and Mr Brode came afterwards.</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Yes.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   And my sister in law was definitely not in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a>restaurant at any time during the shooting, or before the shooting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Yes.   You see, I am referring to page 73 Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a>Chairman, of the second bundle where we have Mr Brode's </p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a>statement.  I am not sure what day it was made, but it seems to be </p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a>the 22nd of October 1997.  And I will just read to you again what he </p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a>says.</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a>	I am reading from paragraph three, the sub-heading "the </p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a>incident".  I had been on duty at Machados restaurant on the night </p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a>of 30 December 1993, when the incident in question took place.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a>The restaurant had been quite full that evening, being the festive </p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a>season and everyone was in a jolly mood.</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a>	After the restaurant had closed, the owner Joe Cerqueira, his </p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a>brother and another colleague whose name I can't remember, had </p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a>been clearing the restaurant and set about preparing the restaurant </p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a>for the next day's business when we heard what we assumed was a </p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a>car backfiring in the road outside.   This sound continued and we </p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a>thought it may also be the sound of fireworks thrown by some </p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a>partygoers outside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a>	I was the first to walk out of the restaurant to investigate and </p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a>was followed by my colleagues.  I saw individuals coming out of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a>Heidelberg Tavern, which is located next to Machados restaurant.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a>They were making their way to a dark coloured car.  I saw what I </p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a>again thought was flares or fireworks and then noticed these </p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a>individuals were firing automatic machine gun fire in all directions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a>	Once they spotted me and my colleagues, they fired in our </p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a>direction.  In the resulting confusion, we pushed our way back into </p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a>the restaurant and took cover as best we could.  I remember lying </p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a>flat on the floor of the restaurant.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a>	On page 74 at the top - once the firing had stopped, I ran out </p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a>of the restaurant, it was at this stage that I saw the deceased, Joe </p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a>Cerqueira lying, dying in the gutter.  He had been shot in the chest.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a>The result was complete mayhem as people ran around in shock, </p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a>shouting for help.  It was only at this stage, when I knelt down next </p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a>to the deceased, that I realised that I had been shot in the leg. </p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a>	My thoughts at that stage were about Joe Cerqueira and I </p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a>remember thinking Joe, you can't die now.  The exact details of what </p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a>happened after that, are not clear to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a>	So, in that statement too, he doesn't mention you specifically, </p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a>although he may have meant when he said once they, that is now the </p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a>... (intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   What about his brother?  Is that not this </p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a>witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   If you can't just give me a chance to finish, I am </p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a>just going to clear that up now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   You started by saying he does not mention you </p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a>specifically.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   That is right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   You don't think that is correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   That is right, he doesn't mention him specifically </p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a>and I am trying to clear that up by saying that he must mean that his </p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a>colleagues, he was clearly referring to the people who were with him </p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a>- his brother and another colleague.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a>	So he must have meant that you were in that same group when </p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a>he says the firing was at you and his colleagues?</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Well, he mentions brother, so I am his brother </p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a>and colleagues.  There were other colleagues, which was Michael, </p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a>which was the waiter that I mentioned before.  Yes, I would say so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Well, it is just that from what you are saying, </p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a>you appear to play a leading role, you went outside, you pulled Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a>Brode in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   You went back outside, you went to your brother </p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a>first?</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Now, I am just asking, one would have thought </p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a>that Brode would mention these things.</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   I don't know Sir, you would have to ask Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a>Brode.  I am telling you like it is, you are asking me the questions, I </p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a>am giving it to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Fine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   And if Mr Brode's statement seems wrong to </p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a>you, you would have to ask Mr Brode.</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Yes, now do you respect what I am just putting </p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a>to you, it is not what I am saying because clearly I wasn't there.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a>am just reading to you what is in the documents before us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Sure, I do that, but you seem to be battering me </p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a>all the time about Mr Brode's statement.  I am not here about Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a>Brode, I am here about my brother and I am giving you, like you've </p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a>asked the truth, I am telling you how I saw it.  I am telling you that </p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a>is the story.</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a>	If Mr Brode has got something different in that statement, I </p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a>am sorry Sir, but you would have to ask Mr Brode.  I wasn't there </p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a>when Mr Brode gave the statement, I am telling you like it is when I </p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a>was there, and I was definitely there.  Because as you've mentioned </p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a>in your statement, I am glad you brought it up about the brother and </p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a>colleagues, because I am very much his brother.</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a>MR PRIOR:   Mr Chairman, with respect, it is difficult - the way in </p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a>which my learned friend asks the questions, he wants the witness to </p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a>answer a question how another witness or why another witness said </p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a>certain things in his statement and that is within the peculiar </p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a>knowledge of that other witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a>	Mr Brode will be called and he obviously will answer </p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a>questions on the differences between the evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Unless Mr Arendse is going to suggest that this </p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a>witness was not there, you see.</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a>MR PRIOR:   Yes, Mr Chairman and or fabricating his evidence I </p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a>don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Well, fabricating or not but unless Mr Arendse is </p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a>going to suggest to him, look you were not there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a>MR PRIOR:   Well, then that is a valid question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Well, it must also surely be valid if there are two </p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a>people who said they were at a particular scene, that you can put the </p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a>one person's version to a witness.  I mean, am I not doing that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   You can put that to him, but you can't ask him </p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a>why did the other chap not mention your name, that is going too far.</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Mr Cerqueira, you were not here from the </p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a>beginning of these proceedings and you were not here when Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a>Gqomfa, that is the applicant on your far right, was giving his </p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a>evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   No, I was not here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Okay.  Now, I am not sure whether Mr Brode </p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a>was here all the time.  But Mr Gqomfa said that after he got into the </p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a>vehicle, he was one of the attackers, he heard shots fired in his </p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a>direction and he responded by shooting in the direction where the </p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a>shots came from and at no stage was he challenged on that </p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a>statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a>MR PRIOR:   With respect, Mr Chairman, I have a recollection that </p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a>it was put to the applicant that he wasn't fired at.  And I speak </p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a>under correction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   I think we need to find that, it was never put to </p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a>Mr Gqomfa that ... (intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   You can find that, but put your question </p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a>nevertheless.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   I am just putting it, I think it is important then to </p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a>clear this up because Mr Brode, I am just putting it to you Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a>Cerqueira, Mr Brode, if he was here, and if he was with you and saw </p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a>more or less given detail here and there, that he saw more or less </p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a>what you saw and heard what you heard, it was never as far as Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a>Gqomfa's statement is concerned, as far as his evidence is </p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a>concerned, it was never put to him that shots were not fired and that </p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a>he is either mistaken or that he is lying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Sir, like you say I wasn't here so I don't know.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a>I don't know, but I would also like to at some stage to ask Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a>Gqomfa, is it, is that the gentleman's name, is it Mr Gqomfa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Mr Gqomfa, if the three of us, which one of us </p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a>was shooting at him, because we were being shot at.  I had nothing </p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a>in my hand, Mr Brode had nothing in his hand, why was he shooting </p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a>at Mr Brode and myself? </p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a>	There were four of us standing there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   But we know from your evidence ... </p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a>(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   If he says that my brother was shooting at him, </p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a>how come did he shoot at us in the first place?  Does he also say </p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a>that I had something in my hand or that Mr Brode or that Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a>Michael had something in his hand?</p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Mr Cerqueira, we also know from your evidence </p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a>and from what Mr Brode said that your brother had run out, even </p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a>before the two of you got to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Sorry, could you repeat that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   That was after the three of them had been out, </p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a>they had been shot at, they have gone back into the restaurant.  It </p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a>was then that they started looking for the brother, they had not seen </p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a>the brother outside when the three of them were outside.  Is that not </p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a>quite clear from  his evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   I am not sure whether that is so clear Judge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Well, that is what he said and up to now, you </p>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a>haven't challenged it Mr Arendse.  He said Brode went out first, he </p>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a>came out and the other colleague came out.  They then started </p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a>shooting at them, and he pulled Brode back into the restaurant.  You </p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a>put that to him a moment ago that he pulled Brode back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   I also put it to him that Brode said he ran inside, </p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a>looked for his brother, this is on page 47 he called at Cerqueira to </p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a>take his firearm held behind the bar counter into his hand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   That's after he had been shot at, start at the </p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a>bottom of page 46 "as fire was aimed at him, he realised that they </p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a>were shooting at him from the motor vehicle, he swung around to </p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a>run inside."</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Then he runs inside and he realises that </p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a>Cerqueira is not inside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   He has spoken throughout and this witness has, </p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a>of being shot at while the three of them were outside.  They were </p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a>not shooting at that stage.  You can't ignore that Mr Arendse.</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Arendse, I think in fairness to you, you are </p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a>putting to this witness what Gqomfa said.  Gqomfa said that he saw </p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a>somebody or he heard somebody firing at him, whereupon he fired at </p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a>that person, he shot at that person.  You are putting that question to </p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a>this witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   That is correct Mr Chairman, there is no basis </p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a>for Judge Wilson intervening in this matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   No, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   What I am suggesting Mr Arendse, you were </p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a>putting it on the basis that that is why Gqomfa began shooting, </p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a>because somebody was shooting at him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a>	But there is the evidence of this witness that Gqomfa had </p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a>already shot at them even if the brother went out afterwards with a </p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a>gun.</p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   I don't propose taking this point any further.</p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Cerqueira, in fairness to the applicants, </p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a>Counsel says that this is what the applicant said.  Now, I don't want </p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a>you to argue back, you are given a chance to admit or deny whether </p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a>that is what happened and that he, Mr Gqomfa, fired only after </p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a>somebody else had fired at him.  That somebody else was your </p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a>brother, that is what he is putting to you because that is what Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a>Gqomfa had said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a>	Now, from the answer you had given, it seems that you </p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a>disagree with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   I do Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Well, just say that you disagree with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   I disagree.</p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Carry on, Mr Arendse.</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Did you say yesterday Mr Cerqueira, that you </p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a>made a statement to the Police or that you don't understand why </p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a>they didn't take a statement from you at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   No, I said they took a statement from me the </p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a>following day and the gentleman wrote it down.  It was Mr Lennon </p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a>Knipe was there and some other Police Officer was there in civilian </p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a>clothes and he took me to the counter and I said what I saw, and he </p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a>wrote it down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   And you made that statement, you know they </p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a>usually ask you to take the oath and so on, and you signed the </p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a>statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   If you are asking me if I took the oath, I can't </p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a>remember, but he did definitely take the statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Can you remember signing the statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   I think so.  I could be under correction, but I </p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a>think so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Let me just read to you what Mr Gqomfa said in </p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a>his written statement.  Unfortunately we don't have a transcript </p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a>available of what he said when he was giving evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a>	He says the attack lasted for about two to three minutes.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a>then withdrew last.  The others were already in the car which was </p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a>idling and was moving very, very slowly in the direction of the robot </p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a>against the one way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a>	After I got into the car, when we approached the robot, some </p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a>shots were fired in my direction.  I rolled down the window and </p>
<p class="line" id="line546"><a name="pos546"></a>opened fire.  I now know that the fire which I had returned, had hit </p>
<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a>one Jose Cerqueira and had fatally wounded him.  That is what he </p>
<p class="line" id="line548"><a name="pos548"></a>said.  Do you want to comment on that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   You have already put that to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Mr Arendse, Mr Gqomfa can say what he likes. </p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a> There was no shots fired at him, certainly not from myself or Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a>Brode or Mike or for that matter, from my point of view, from my </p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a>brother, because if he had fired shots with a gun, the gun would </p>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a>have been lying next to his body.  And when I came out, the only </p>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a>thing that was lying next to his body was the pouch, a whole lot of </p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a>blood and nothing else.  So I don't see how he could have shot with </p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a>a pouch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a>	So I think Mr Gqomfa is not telling the truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Is it possible that the gun could have been in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a>pouch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   No, I don't think so because if we take a similar </p>
<p class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a>gun and try and fit it in that pouch, I don't think it could fit in there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Tell, us then, what gun are we talking about </p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a>here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   We are talking about a long barrel 45.</p>
<p class="line" id="line566"><a name="pos566"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Yes, we are talking about a pistol?</p>
<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line568"><a name="pos568"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Semi automatic pistol.</p>
<p class="line" id="line570"><a name="pos570"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   And my instructions are that the shots that came </p>
<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a>from the direction of where Machados is, came from a pistol.</p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   I don't know Sir, that is what you are telling </p>
<p class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a>me, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Yes, now you told us earlier, and I understand </p>
<p class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a>and I agree with you, everything happened very quickly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   When you came out and you saw your brother </p>
<p class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a>lying there, surely your focus was on your brother, trying to retrieve </p>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a>his body, trying to see whether he was alive?</p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Yes, the focus was on my brother, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   You weren't looking out for a gun or for any </p>
<p class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a>other item for that matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   You are quite correct, I wasn't looking for any </p>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a>other item.  It just so happened, that when I lifted my brother's </p>
<p class="line" id="line585"><a name="pos585"></a>head, the pouch was lying next to his head and I noticed the pouch </p>
<p class="line" id="line586"><a name="pos586"></a>lying next to his head.</p>
<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   And the gun might have been lying somewhere in </p>
<p class="line" id="line588"><a name="pos588"></a>the gutter?  Is that not possible?  Is it not possible that it could have </p>
<p class="line" id="line589"><a name="pos589"></a>been lying somewhere?</p>
<p class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   I did not see any gun.</p>
<p class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   No, I accept that you did not see any gun.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a>accept that, okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line593"><a name="pos593"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Mr Arendse, many things can be possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line594"><a name="pos594"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Yes, that is all I want to know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   I did not see a gun, I picked up my brother's </p>
<p class="line" id="line596"><a name="pos596"></a>head, the pouch was lying there next to his head.  Mr Brode came, </p>
<p class="line" id="line597"><a name="pos597"></a>surely he would have noticed the gun as well.  And after a couple of </p>
<p class="line" id="line598"><a name="pos598"></a>minutes, after five minutes or ten minutes after, I don't know, then </p>
<p class="line" id="line599"><a name="pos599"></a>he handed me the gun.  You would have to ask Mr Brode where he </p>
<p class="line" id="line600"><a name="pos600"></a>got the gun.</p>
<p class="line" id="line601"><a name="pos601"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Because you see it is, why, for what reason </p>
<p class="line" id="line602"><a name="pos602"></a>would Mr Brode just hand, we are going to ask that, I just want </p>
<p class="line" id="line603"><a name="pos603"></a>your comments.  For what reason would Mr Brode hand a gun to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line604"><a name="pos604"></a>Police when a gun didn't figure at all in this situation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line605"><a name="pos605"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Did Mr Brode hand a gun to the Police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line606"><a name="pos606"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   That is what the witness said, Judge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line607"><a name="pos607"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   No Sir, I didn't say that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line608"><a name="pos608"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   He said Mr Brode handed the gun to him and he </p>
<p class="line" id="line609"><a name="pos609"></a>handed it to the Police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line610"><a name="pos610"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Oh, it is the same thing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line611"><a name="pos611"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   It is not the same thing, it is two different </p>
<p class="line" id="line612"><a name="pos612"></a>things.  Mr Brode gave me the gun and I gave it to the Police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line613"><a name="pos613"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   That is better then.  I am glad that's been cleared </p>
<p class="line" id="line614"><a name="pos614"></a>up, that is better then.    Why did he hand the gun to you if the gun </p>
<p class="line" id="line615"><a name="pos615"></a>didn't feature at all in this situation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line616"><a name="pos616"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   I've got no idea, you will have to ask Mr Brode.</p>
<p class="line" id="line617"><a name="pos617"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   I mean if the gun was just lying where it usually </p>
<p class="line" id="line618"><a name="pos618"></a>lay under the counter, or in a desk drawer or whatever, there is no </p>
<p class="line" id="line619"><a name="pos619"></a>reason that one can think of why the gun should just be produced </p>
<p class="line" id="line620"><a name="pos620"></a>and given to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line621"><a name="pos621"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Mr Arendse, are you suggesting when gunshots </p>
<p class="line" id="line622"><a name="pos622"></a>had been fired all over the street, when a man was lying dead in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line623"><a name="pos623"></a>gutter, you think of logical reasons?  Surely any person there who </p>
<p class="line" id="line624"><a name="pos624"></a>knew there was a weapon available, would want to have it in his </p>
<p class="line" id="line625"><a name="pos625"></a>possession?  Wouldn't you ... (intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line626"><a name="pos626"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   No Judge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line627"><a name="pos627"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   If they came back, so you would be in a position </p>
<p class="line" id="line628"><a name="pos628"></a>to do something?</p>
<p class="line" id="line629"><a name="pos629"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   No, no.  I wouldn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line630"><a name="pos630"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Mr Arendse, at the time I didn't have a gun with </p>
<p class="line" id="line631"><a name="pos631"></a>me, but I was hoping that I had a gun with me.  I was hoping that I </p>
<p class="line" id="line632"><a name="pos632"></a>had a gun with me, and that is why I went into the restaurant, </p>
<p class="line" id="line633"><a name="pos633"></a>shouting for the gun to protect myself because when somebody is </p>
<p class="line" id="line634"><a name="pos634"></a>firing shots at you, surely Mr Arendse, even in your case, you would </p>
<p class="line" id="line635"><a name="pos635"></a>have also hoped for something to defend yourself with?   Isn't that </p>
<p class="line" id="line636"><a name="pos636"></a>so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line637"><a name="pos637"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Well, exactly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line638"><a name="pos638"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line639"><a name="pos639"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   I want to suggest to you then, that your brother </p>
<p class="line" id="line640"><a name="pos640"></a>did want to defend himself and that is why he ran out with a gun.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line641"><a name="pos641"></a>And that is why he aimed shots, you agree he was a brave man in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line642"><a name="pos642"></a>ordinary course?  He stood up for himself, he stood up for his </p>
<p class="line" id="line643"><a name="pos643"></a>rights?  He worked hard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line644"><a name="pos644"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   My brother was a very soft man, in fact if I was </p>
<p class="line" id="line645"><a name="pos645"></a>the one that got shot I would have said more that I am the </p>
<p class="line" id="line646"><a name="pos646"></a>aggressive man.</p>
<p class="line" id="line647"><a name="pos647"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Well, I mean let's not get into the semantics.</p>
<p class="line" id="line648"><a name="pos648"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Arendse, I think yes please, just move on ... </p>
<p class="line" id="line649"><a name="pos649"></a>(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line650"><a name="pos650"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Yes, he ran out with, I want to suggest to you </p>
<p class="line" id="line651"><a name="pos651"></a>Mr Cerqueira, he went when he heard the popping sound, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line652"><a name="pos652"></a>cracking sound, he ran outside, he took his gun and he aimed shots </p>
<p class="line" id="line653"><a name="pos653"></a>at the attackers, as they got into the car.  And those are the shots </p>
<p class="line" id="line654"><a name="pos654"></a>that Mr Gqomfa says was fired in his direction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line655"><a name="pos655"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Mr Arendse ... (intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line656"><a name="pos656"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Are you now saying he shot up the road as they </p>
<p class="line" id="line657"><a name="pos657"></a>got into the car outside the Tavern, is that what you are now </p>
<p class="line" id="line658"><a name="pos658"></a>putting?  Is that your version on behalf of your clients?</p>
<p class="line" id="line659"><a name="pos659"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Well, if could hardly be anything else.  What can </p>
<p class="line" id="line660"><a name="pos660"></a>it be, I mean Mr Gqomfa ... (intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line661"><a name="pos661"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   I want to know, I am asking you Mr Arendse, is </p>
<p class="line" id="line662"><a name="pos662"></a>that the version you are putting that as they got into the car in front </p>
<p class="line" id="line663"><a name="pos663"></a>of the Tavern the deceased shot at them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line664"><a name="pos664"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Let me not put words into Mr Gqomfa's, this is </p>
<p class="line" id="line665"><a name="pos665"></a>what is in his statement.  He says, he withdrew last, the others were </p>
<p class="line" id="line666"><a name="pos666"></a>already in the car which was idling and was moving very slowly.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line667"><a name="pos667"></a>After I got into the car and we approached the robot, some shots </p>
<p class="line" id="line668"><a name="pos668"></a>were fired in my direction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line669"><a name="pos669"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   After I got into the car and when we approached </p>
<p class="line" id="line670"><a name="pos670"></a>the robot?  What you put to the witness a moment ago was as they </p>
<p class="line" id="line671"><a name="pos671"></a>were getting into the car, that is what I queried Mr Arendse.</p>
<p class="line" id="line672"><a name="pos672"></a>	There is no suggestion at any shots were fired at them while </p>
<p class="line" id="line673"><a name="pos673"></a>they were getting into the car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line674"><a name="pos674"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   When he was in the car, the shots were fired Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line675"><a name="pos675"></a>Cerqueira.  I am suggesting to you that it was your brother who </p>
<p class="line" id="line676"><a name="pos676"></a>fired those shots.  And he is the only one who could have fired those </p>
<p class="line" id="line677"><a name="pos677"></a>shots and that explains why Mr Brode produced the gun, handed it </p>
<p class="line" id="line678"><a name="pos678"></a>to you and you handed it to the Police.  There is no other reason </p>
<p class="line" id="line679"><a name="pos679"></a>why that gun would have been produced to the Police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line680"><a name="pos680"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Mr Arendse, like I said earlier on, there was no </p>
<p class="line" id="line681"><a name="pos681"></a>way in my view, like you've got your view that you've just given me, </p>
<p class="line" id="line682"><a name="pos682"></a>there is no way in my view that my brother could have shot at the </p>
<p class="line" id="line683"><a name="pos683"></a>car when they were getting into the car out of the Heidelberg Tavern </p>
<p class="line" id="line684"><a name="pos684"></a>because myself, Mr Brode and Michael was standing in front where </p>
<p class="line" id="line685"><a name="pos685"></a>we were taking the shots, so if my brother had to shoot, this is just </p>
<p class="line" id="line686"><a name="pos686"></a>an assumption that I am making like you are Sir, he would have had </p>
<p class="line" id="line687"><a name="pos687"></a>to shoot us first before he shot at anybody else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line688"><a name="pos688"></a>	And I would have heard the shots from behind me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line689"><a name="pos689"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Arendse, I think you've got an answer.  He </p>
<p class="line" id="line690"><a name="pos690"></a>does  not agree with the way, he does not agree with the evidence </p>
<p class="line" id="line691"><a name="pos691"></a>that you are putting to him, that is Mr Gqomfa's evidence and he has </p>
<p class="line" id="line692"><a name="pos692"></a>denied that, now can we move on from there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line693"><a name="pos693"></a>ADV SANDI:   Mr Cerqueira, did Mr Brode say anything to you as </p>
<p class="line" id="line694"><a name="pos694"></a>he was giving you the gun?</p>
<p class="line" id="line695"><a name="pos695"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Not that I can recall Sir, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line696"><a name="pos696"></a>ADV SANDI:   He just gave you the gun?</p>
<p class="line" id="line697"><a name="pos697"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   He just gave me the gun.  He said he is Joe's </p>
<p class="line" id="line698"><a name="pos698"></a>gun, I think that is what he said, something to that effect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line699"><a name="pos699"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Carry on please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line700"><a name="pos700"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Mr Cerqueira, I also want to just put something </p>
<p class="line" id="line701"><a name="pos701"></a>for the record.  I find it very odd Mr Brode gave a statement, he </p>
<p class="line" id="line702"><a name="pos702"></a>gave evidence in court and he gave a statement to the Investigators </p>
<p class="line" id="line703"><a name="pos703"></a>of this Committee.  Mr Gqomfa gave his evidence as I have read it </p>
<p class="line" id="line704"><a name="pos704"></a>out to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line705"><a name="pos705"></a>	And he wasn't challenged on that at all.  Now, this is a critical </p>
<p class="line" id="line706"><a name="pos706"></a>aspect, you agree with that, it is a critical aspect?</p>
<p class="line" id="line707"><a name="pos707"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   I agree, it is a very critical aspect, especially </p>
<p class="line" id="line708"><a name="pos708"></a>when somebody get shot at.</p>
<p class="line" id="line709"><a name="pos709"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Yes, for no reason apparently?</p>
<p class="line" id="line710"><a name="pos710"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   For no reason.</p>
<p class="line" id="line711"><a name="pos711"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Yes, for just standing on the corner?</p>
<p class="line" id="line712"><a name="pos712"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line713"><a name="pos713"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Yes.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line714"><a name="pos714"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Very critical.</p>
<p class="line" id="line715"><a name="pos715"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Now, you know, have you got any explanation </p>
<p class="line" id="line716"><a name="pos716"></a>why it wasn't raised?</p>
<p class="line" id="line717"><a name="pos717"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Sorry?</p>
<p class="line" id="line718"><a name="pos718"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   You didn't want to be part of this process?</p>
<p class="line" id="line719"><a name="pos719"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   No Sir, like I mentioned yesterday.  I didn't </p>
<p class="line" id="line720"><a name="pos720"></a>want to be part of this process because they had already been </p>
<p class="line" id="line721"><a name="pos721"></a>sentenced, and I was quite prepared to forgive the whole thing, not </p>
<p class="line" id="line722"><a name="pos722"></a>forget, I still haven't forgotten. I still haven't forgotten, to forgive </p>
<p class="line" id="line723"><a name="pos723"></a>until these allegations came up that my brother was shooting at </p>
<p class="line" id="line724"><a name="pos724"></a>them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line725"><a name="pos725"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line726"><a name="pos726"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Surely, you know, then I battled with my mind. </p>
<p class="line" id="line727"><a name="pos727"></a> That if my brother was shooting at them, then surely when they </p>
<p class="line" id="line728"><a name="pos728"></a>were shooting at us, we must have been shooting at them as well.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line729"><a name="pos729"></a>Were we shooting at them or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line730"><a name="pos730"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   All this is a repetition of a great deal of evidence </p>
<p class="line" id="line731"><a name="pos731"></a>we have already heard.  Can we move on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line732"><a name="pos732"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Were you approached at all by the TRC </p>
<p class="line" id="line733"><a name="pos733"></a>Investigators to make a statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line734"><a name="pos734"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   They contacted my sister-in-law and I told my </p>
<p class="line" id="line735"><a name="pos735"></a>sister-in-law that I didn't really want anything to do with that, and </p>
<p class="line" id="line736"><a name="pos736"></a>so did she.  I think they did contact her.  I was told by the family </p>
<p class="line" id="line737"><a name="pos737"></a>and I said the people had been sentenced, and I don't want anything </p>
<p class="line" id="line738"><a name="pos738"></a>to do with it.  Quite happy with that.  Quite happy to forgive, but </p>
<p class="line" id="line739"><a name="pos739"></a>not forget.  I haven't forgotten, it might take me another year or </p>
<p class="line" id="line740"><a name="pos740"></a>two, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line741"><a name="pos741"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   You are very angry, is that right, about what </p>
<p class="line" id="line742"><a name="pos742"></a>happened to your brother?</p>
<p class="line" id="line743"><a name="pos743"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Sir, must I be quite honest with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line744"><a name="pos744"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Yes.  We want nothing else here in this court.</p>
<p class="line" id="line745"><a name="pos745"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   I can't find, this is the Truth and Reconciliation </p>
<p class="line" id="line746"><a name="pos746"></a>Committee, I can't find anger in my gut when I look at that man, but </p>
<p class="line" id="line747"><a name="pos747"></a>today I must be, with due respect to you, I am very angry at you the </p>
<p class="line" id="line748"><a name="pos748"></a>way you handled things yesterday, I was very angry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line749"><a name="pos749"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line750"><a name="pos750"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   I was very, very angry Sir.  Like you  </p>
<p class="line" id="line751"><a name="pos751"></a>mentioned, when you stated that I wasn't on the scene.  And yet </p>
<p class="line" id="line752"><a name="pos752"></a>today you read to me another statement where it actually mentions </p>
<p class="line" id="line753"><a name="pos753"></a>that the brother was in the restaurant and colleagues.</p>
<p class="line" id="line754"><a name="pos754"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line755"><a name="pos755"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   How come you overlooked something like that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line756"><a name="pos756"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Because Mr Cerqueira, must I give you an </p>
<p class="line" id="line757"><a name="pos757"></a>answer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line758"><a name="pos758"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Yes, please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line759"><a name="pos759"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   On the first part of being angry with me, I feel </p>
<p class="line" id="line760"><a name="pos760"></a>sorry for you, okay and I forgive you.  Are you a Christian?</p>
<p class="line" id="line761"><a name="pos761"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   I am.</p>
<p class="line" id="line762"><a name="pos762"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Aren't you taught to forgive?</p>
<p class="line" id="line763"><a name="pos763"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Sir, what I am taught and what I am not taught, </p>
<p class="line" id="line764"><a name="pos764"></a>has got nothing to do with you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line765"><a name="pos765"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   How long have you been in this country?</p>
<p class="line" id="line766"><a name="pos766"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Are you a Christian Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line767"><a name="pos767"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line768"><a name="pos768"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   I want to put a stop to this kind of questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line769"><a name="pos769"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Mr Cerqueira, I put to you what the Judge had </p>
<p class="line" id="line770"><a name="pos770"></a>summarised and what was said in a court of law under oath.  This </p>
<p class="line" id="line771"><a name="pos771"></a>statement in here means absolutely nothing.  This is not under oath </p>
<p class="line" id="line772"><a name="pos772"></a>and it is not signed by Mr Brode.</p>
<p class="line" id="line773"><a name="pos773"></a>	Are you still saying that I was unfair not to put that to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line774"><a name="pos774"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Sir, when you ask me questions about Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line775"><a name="pos775"></a>Brode, I think you are very unfair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line776"><a name="pos776"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Arendse, what a witness' opinion is of </p>
<p class="line" id="line777"><a name="pos777"></a>Counsel, is a matter of no concern to the Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line778"><a name="pos778"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Mr Harmse, I am not interested in Mr Brode's </p>
<p class="line" id="line779"><a name="pos779"></a>... (intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line780"><a name="pos780"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   It is Arendse, okay, Arendse, not Harmse.</p>
<p class="line" id="line781"><a name="pos781"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Mr Arendse, I am not interested in Mr Brode's </p>
<p class="line" id="line782"><a name="pos782"></a>statements.  I came here ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line783"><a name="pos783"></a>MR PRIOR:   Mr Chairman, I must object at this line of ... </p>
<p class="line" id="line784"><a name="pos784"></a>(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line785"><a name="pos785"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   I am going to stop these proceedings for a while </p>
<p class="line" id="line786"><a name="pos786"></a>Mr Arendse, if it is necessary.  I've told you once before please get </p>
<p class="line" id="line787"><a name="pos787"></a>on with the facts and not your personal differences or his differences </p>
<p class="line" id="line788"><a name="pos788"></a>towards you. </p>
<p class="line" id="line789"><a name="pos789"></a>You've got to take whatever he says.  If he is unhappy with the way </p>
<p class="line" id="line790"><a name="pos790"></a>you've questioned him, please you are doing your duty as Counsel, </p>
<p class="line" id="line791"><a name="pos791"></a>but don't involve in argument about that.  Carry on with your </p>
<p class="line" id="line792"><a name="pos792"></a>questions Mr Arendse.</p>
<p class="line" id="line793"><a name="pos793"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Mr Cerqueira, I want to suggest to you, I want </p>
<p class="line" id="line794"><a name="pos794"></a>to put it to you that because you are angry, angry at me, angry at </p>
<p class="line" id="line795"><a name="pos795"></a>the applicants, angry ... (intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line796"><a name="pos796"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   I am not angry at the applicants Mr Arendse, I </p>
<p class="line" id="line797"><a name="pos797"></a>am angry at you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line798"><a name="pos798"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Well, now that you are angry at me, I want to </p>
<p class="line" id="line799"><a name="pos799"></a>suggest to you and put it to you that because of your anger, you </p>
<p class="line" id="line800"><a name="pos800"></a>don't like to hear that there is a possibility that your brother may </p>
<p class="line" id="line801"><a name="pos801"></a>have had a firearm and may have shot at the applicants, at one of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line802"><a name="pos802"></a>applicants as he says he did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line803"><a name="pos803"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Mr Arendse, I am not saying there isn't a </p>
<p class="line" id="line804"><a name="pos804"></a>possibility, there is always a possibility of 1001 things that could </p>
<p class="line" id="line805"><a name="pos805"></a>have happened.  What I said to you is that when I got to the body, </p>
<p class="line" id="line806"><a name="pos806"></a>there was no gun.  I didn't see the gun.	Mr Brode came and sat </p>
<p class="line" id="line807"><a name="pos807"></a>next to us on the pavement, he didn't see any gun and a little while </p>
<p class="line" id="line808"><a name="pos808"></a>later, he only produced the gun.  Therefore Sir, with due respect, I </p>
<p class="line" id="line809"><a name="pos809"></a>think ask Mr Brode where he got the gun.  I don't know where he </p>
<p class="line" id="line810"><a name="pos810"></a>got the gun.  He might have got it in the restaurant at a later stage, </p>
<p class="line" id="line811"><a name="pos811"></a>I don't know.	But yes, there is a possibility, there is 1001 </p>
<p class="line" id="line812"><a name="pos812"></a>possibilities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line813"><a name="pos813"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Can I just ask you again.  It seems odd to us </p>
<p class="line" id="line814"><a name="pos814"></a>that, is me and my colleague, that after the attackers are gone, a gun </p>
<p class="line" id="line815"><a name="pos815"></a>is produced.   For what reason can that possibly be?</p>
<p class="line" id="line816"><a name="pos816"></a>MR PRIOR:   Mr Chairman, with respect, this question has been </p>
<p class="line" id="line817"><a name="pos817"></a>asked again and again in several ways.  Answers have been given and </p>
<p class="line" id="line818"><a name="pos818"></a>the Committee has already given a ruling for Mr Arendse to move </p>
<p class="line" id="line819"><a name="pos819"></a>off onto something fresh.  I must now object and ask for a final </p>
<p class="line" id="line820"><a name="pos820"></a>ruling on this particular aspect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line821"><a name="pos821"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   I will leave it there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line822"><a name="pos822"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Proceed with the next question Mr Arendse.</p>
<p class="line" id="line823"><a name="pos823"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Mr Cerqueira, when you came out ... </p>
<p class="line" id="line824"><a name="pos824"></a>(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line825"><a name="pos825"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Sorry, it is Mr Cerqueira.</p>
<p class="line" id="line826"><a name="pos826"></a>MR ARENDSE:   Cerqueira right.  When you moved back in, you </p>
<p class="line" id="line827"><a name="pos827"></a>pulled Mr Brode in, the other waiter came in with you, your brother </p>
<p class="line" id="line828"><a name="pos828"></a>didn't come in with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line829"><a name="pos829"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   No, Sir.  I didn't see my brother, that is the </p>
<p class="line" id="line830"><a name="pos830"></a>reason why I came inside the restaurant, shouting for my brother.</p>
<p class="line" id="line831"><a name="pos831"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Now, yes, because when you came out, your </p>
<p class="line" id="line832"><a name="pos832"></a>brother was already outside, he must have been outside?</p>
<p class="line" id="line833"><a name="pos833"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   No, he was not outside.  There were only three </p>
<p class="line" id="line834"><a name="pos834"></a>of us standing outside, Mr Arendse.</p>
<p class="line" id="line835"><a name="pos835"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   But I thought you said you came outside to look </p>
<p class="line" id="line836"><a name="pos836"></a>for your brother?</p>
<p class="line" id="line837"><a name="pos837"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   No Sir, I said I came inside again looking for </p>
<p class="line" id="line838"><a name="pos838"></a>my brother.</p>
<p class="line" id="line839"><a name="pos839"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   He did not say that Mr Arendse.  He said they </p>
<p class="line" id="line840"><a name="pos840"></a>came outside to look at the noise, the source of the noise.</p>
<p class="line" id="line841"><a name="pos841"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   I said I thought he said that.  Can the witness </p>
<p class="line" id="line842"><a name="pos842"></a>correct me Judge, instead of you please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line843"><a name="pos843"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   No, I think ... (intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line844"><a name="pos844"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   No, Mr Arendse, as Counsel you must put things </p>
<p class="line" id="line845"><a name="pos845"></a>accurately.</p>
<p class="line" id="line846"><a name="pos846"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   I put it accurately, I said I thought, now if I </p>
<p class="line" id="line847"><a name="pos847"></a>thought wrongly, then he must tell me that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line848"><a name="pos848"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   I am telling you you thought wrongly and you </p>
<p class="line" id="line849"><a name="pos849"></a>will accept that ruling and you will stop carrying on as you are Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line850"><a name="pos850"></a>Arendse.  My brother the Chairman, has already offered to adjourn </p>
<p class="line" id="line851"><a name="pos851"></a>the matter so that you can quieten down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line852"><a name="pos852"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Do you want an answer from that Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line853"><a name="pos853"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line854"><a name="pos854"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   The only time that I went outside, looking for </p>
<p class="line" id="line855"><a name="pos855"></a>my brother, was after the shots had been fired.  After we had been in </p>
<p class="line" id="line856"><a name="pos856"></a>the restaurant, looking for him and then we ran outside, and then I </p>
<p class="line" id="line857"><a name="pos857"></a>found him outside.  Not before the shots had been fired.</p>
<p class="line" id="line858"><a name="pos858"></a>	Before the shots had been fired, I went into the restaurant, </p>
<p class="line" id="line859"><a name="pos859"></a>not outside, into the restaurant, looking for my brother.</p>
<p class="line" id="line860"><a name="pos860"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   So at which point could he have been shot?  Was </p>
<p class="line" id="line861"><a name="pos861"></a>it before or after you came out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line862"><a name="pos862"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   I've got no idea.  I've got no idea.</p>
<p class="line" id="line863"><a name="pos863"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   If he had been shot before, when you went out </p>
<p class="line" id="line864"><a name="pos864"></a>of the restaurant for the first time and looked up the road, would </p>
<p class="line" id="line865"><a name="pos865"></a>you have seen his body?</p>
<p class="line" id="line866"><a name="pos866"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Yes.  He was definitely not on the pavement </p>
<p class="line" id="line867"><a name="pos867"></a>when I went outside for the first time, when the shots were being </p>
<p class="line" id="line868"><a name="pos868"></a>fired at us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line869"><a name="pos869"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   So he must have then, did he run passed you at </p>
<p class="line" id="line870"><a name="pos870"></a>any stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line871"><a name="pos871"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   I didn't see him run passed me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line872"><a name="pos872"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   So is it your evidence that when you came </p>
<p class="line" id="line873"><a name="pos873"></a>outside with Brode and with the other waiter, your brother was not </p>
<p class="line" id="line874"><a name="pos874"></a>there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line875"><a name="pos875"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   What I think from my view Sir, is that when the </p>
<p class="line" id="line876"><a name="pos876"></a>three of us were standing on the pavement looking up, he must have </p>
<p class="line" id="line877"><a name="pos877"></a>come and stood behind us, therefore I did not see him.  Otherwise, </p>
<p class="line" id="line878"><a name="pos878"></a>believe you me, if he was there, I would have dragged him inside as </p>
<p class="line" id="line879"><a name="pos879"></a>well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line880"><a name="pos880"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   So there is the possibility then that he actually </p>
<p class="line" id="line881"><a name="pos881"></a>came out with you but behind you and you didn't see him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line882"><a name="pos882"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   There is a possibility Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line883"><a name="pos883"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   And when you turned to go back in and pulled </p>
<p class="line" id="line884"><a name="pos884"></a>Brode in and the other waiter ran in with you, your brother either </p>
<p class="line" id="line885"><a name="pos885"></a>didn't turn back or he turned back, but was shot as he also wanted to </p>
<p class="line" id="line886"><a name="pos886"></a>go in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line887"><a name="pos887"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Correct, there is a possibility.  Like I say when </p>
<p class="line" id="line888"><a name="pos888"></a>we first came out, the shots were being fired at us, there is </p>
<p class="line" id="line889"><a name="pos889"></a>definitely no way that he was shooting at them if he was shooting </p>
<p class="line" id="line890"><a name="pos890"></a>behind us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line891"><a name="pos891"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   I put it to you that that version of the way you </p>
<p class="line" id="line892"><a name="pos892"></a>are putting it, is not what happened Mr Cerqueira.  I am putting it to </p>
<p class="line" id="line893"><a name="pos893"></a>you that your brother had gone out first, armed with his gun, had </p>
<p class="line" id="line894"><a name="pos894"></a>fired shots in the direction of this car which was coming in his </p>
<p class="line" id="line895"><a name="pos895"></a>direction, in the direction of the robot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line896"><a name="pos896"></a>	At that point, or immediately afterwards, you came out and </p>
<p class="line" id="line897"><a name="pos897"></a>that is when you retreated, but by then your brother had already </p>
<p class="line" id="line898"><a name="pos898"></a>been shot.  That is what happened Mr Cerqueira.</p>
<p class="line" id="line899"><a name="pos899"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   No, that is not what happened, Mr Arendse.</p>
<p class="line" id="line900"><a name="pos900"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Is it not possible that it could have happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line901"><a name="pos901"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   No, it is not possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line902"><a name="pos902"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Everything happened quickly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line903"><a name="pos903"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Mr Arendse - because when I came outside, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line904"><a name="pos904"></a>only people that were standing in front of me was the two waiters.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line905"><a name="pos905"></a>The waiters were standing in front of me.  There was no way that my </p>
<p class="line" id="line906"><a name="pos906"></a>brother could have been standing, firing in front of me and me not </p>
<p class="line" id="line907"><a name="pos907"></a>seeing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line908"><a name="pos908"></a>	The first shots that were shot at us, was aimed at myself and </p>
<p class="line" id="line909"><a name="pos909"></a>Mr Brode.  Mr Brode got hit on the leg and the shots were on the </p>
<p class="line" id="line910"><a name="pos910"></a>wall, next to Mr Brode's leg.  Surely if my brother was firing and he </p>
<p class="line" id="line911"><a name="pos911"></a>was standing there, I would have seen it.  And surely under those </p>
<p class="line" id="line912"><a name="pos912"></a>conditions, if he was firing at somebody, I wouldn't have even come </p>
<p class="line" id="line913"><a name="pos913"></a>onto the pavement because I would have realised something was </p>
<p class="line" id="line914"><a name="pos914"></a>wrong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line915"><a name="pos915"></a>ADV SANDI:   Mr Cerqueira, is there  a building opposite the </p>
<p class="line" id="line916"><a name="pos916"></a>Heidelberg Tavern?</p>
<p class="line" id="line917"><a name="pos917"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Between our restaurant and the Heidelberg, </p>
<p class="line" id="line918"><a name="pos918"></a>opposite, yes, there is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line919"><a name="pos919"></a>ADV SANDI:   Was that building shot at by the attackers at the </p>
<p class="line" id="line920"><a name="pos920"></a>Tavern?</p>
<p class="line" id="line921"><a name="pos921"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Yes, it was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line922"><a name="pos922"></a>ADV SANDI:   Whose building is that, what sort of building is that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line923"><a name="pos923"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Opposite the road from us, directly, is a </p>
<p class="line" id="line924"><a name="pos924"></a>hardware store and they've got storage upstairs and there is a coffee </p>
<p class="line" id="line925"><a name="pos925"></a>shop directly outside the Tavern and there is a restaurant, called the </p>
<p class="line" id="line926"><a name="pos926"></a>Planet, that is downstairs and upstairs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line927"><a name="pos927"></a>ADV SANDI:   Were there any people at that particular building at </p>
<p class="line" id="line928"><a name="pos928"></a>the time the shooting was taking place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line929"><a name="pos929"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Yes, there were because the restaurant called </p>
<p class="line" id="line930"><a name="pos930"></a>the Planet is - most of its busy period is in the evening at round </p>
<p class="line" id="line931"><a name="pos931"></a>about that time when the incident happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line932"><a name="pos932"></a>ADV SANDI:   Was anyone of them actually hurt or injured?</p>
<p class="line" id="line933"><a name="pos933"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Not to my knowledge, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line934"><a name="pos934"></a>ADV SANDI:   Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line935"><a name="pos935"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Mr Cerqueira, can I put another scenario to you </p>
<p class="line" id="line936"><a name="pos936"></a>as a possibility?  Your brother goes outside before you, with his </p>
<p class="line" id="line937"><a name="pos937"></a>gun, you don't see him, you don't see him, he fires at the attackers </p>
<p class="line" id="line938"><a name="pos938"></a>coming in your direction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line939"><a name="pos939"></a>	You don't hear that, because now you are running out and you </p>
<p class="line" id="line940"><a name="pos940"></a>are coming onto the street, onto the pavement, you don't hear that </p>
<p class="line" id="line941"><a name="pos941"></a>and the attackers shoot at him.  And when you come out onto the </p>
<p class="line" id="line942"><a name="pos942"></a>pavement, that is when these shots are fired in your direction, is that </p>
<p class="line" id="line943"><a name="pos943"></a>not a possibility?</p>
<p class="line" id="line944"><a name="pos944"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   No Sir.  Can I just go through what I said </p>
<p class="line" id="line945"><a name="pos945"></a>yesterday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line946"><a name="pos946"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   You don't have to go through what you've </p>
<p class="line" id="line947"><a name="pos947"></a>already said, you can just say yes or no to that proposition.</p>
<p class="line" id="line948"><a name="pos948"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Sir, in this case, can I just say something?  Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line949"><a name="pos949"></a>Arendse, when we heard the popping sounds like I told you </p>
<p class="line" id="line950"><a name="pos950"></a>yesterday my brother was standing behind the counter, on the inside </p>
<p class="line" id="line951"><a name="pos951"></a>of the counter like I mentioned in my statement yesterday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line952"><a name="pos952"></a>	I was standing on that side of the counter, when the shots </p>
<p class="line" id="line953"><a name="pos953"></a>were being heard, the waiter walked to the door slowly, I walked to </p>
<p class="line" id="line954"><a name="pos954"></a>the door afterwards, my brother was standing behind that counter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line955"><a name="pos955"></a>	When we went onto the pavement, surely if my brother had </p>
<p class="line" id="line956"><a name="pos956"></a>gone first, I would have seen him in front of me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line957"><a name="pos957"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   I am sorry, but I mean if you've said that </p>
<p class="line" id="line958"><a name="pos958"></a>yesterday, you said it, but this is the first time that you have put it </p>
<p class="line" id="line959"><a name="pos959"></a>like that according to my recollection.  I am sorry Mr Cerqueira, I </p>
<p class="line" id="line960"><a name="pos960"></a>don't think that is what you've said yesterday or up to now, </p>
<p class="line" id="line961"><a name="pos961"></a>explaining why your brother, according to you, must have come only </p>
<p class="line" id="line962"><a name="pos962"></a>after you, that you saw him standing behind the counter, you were in </p>
<p class="line" id="line963"><a name="pos963"></a>front of the counter and you went out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line964"><a name="pos964"></a>	I mean you said, didn't you, you must correct me if I am not </p>
<p class="line" id="line965"><a name="pos965"></a>correct, you said you went to look for him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line966"><a name="pos966"></a>MR PRIOR:   With respect, that was after the shots.  Mr Chairman, </p>
<p class="line" id="line967"><a name="pos967"></a>may the appropriate place of the record be found, otherwise we are </p>
<p class="line" id="line968"><a name="pos968"></a>going to have a lot of cross-examination on whether it was said or </p>
<p class="line" id="line969"><a name="pos969"></a>not?  It is certainly my recollection and I led him on that and he told </p>
<p class="line" id="line970"><a name="pos970"></a>the Committee with respect where the positions of the people were </p>
<p class="line" id="line971"><a name="pos971"></a>before the popping sounds were heard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line972"><a name="pos972"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Do you want the transcript to be played back, is </p>
<p class="line" id="line973"><a name="pos973"></a>that what you are suggesting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line974"><a name="pos974"></a>MR PRIOR:   Mr Chairman, I suggest that in order to avoid the type </p>
<p class="line" id="line975"><a name="pos975"></a>of confusion that seems to be prevalent.</p>
<p class="line" id="line976"><a name="pos976"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Arendse, do you want the transcript to be </p>
<p class="line" id="line977"><a name="pos977"></a>played back of all the cross-examination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line978"><a name="pos978"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Mr Chairman, does Mr Prior agree or doesn't he </p>
<p class="line" id="line979"><a name="pos979"></a>agree that that is the first time certainly, that I hear that Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line980"><a name="pos980"></a>Cerqueira is saying that his brother stood behind the counter, he </p>
<p class="line" id="line981"><a name="pos981"></a>stood in front of the counter, he ran out first?  I mean, you know, if </p>
<p class="line" id="line982"><a name="pos982"></a>the Committee and Mr Prior tells me that he has said that before </p>
<p class="line" id="line983"><a name="pos983"></a>already, then I will leave it there.  But it is the first time I hear it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line984"><a name="pos984"></a>ADV SANDI:   Speaking for myself, I cannot locate this particular </p>
<p class="line" id="line985"><a name="pos985"></a>aspect of his evidence in my notes.  But I do have a - I do remember </p>
<p class="line" id="line986"><a name="pos986"></a>him saying that yesterday.  We think that is what he said yesterday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line987"><a name="pos987"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Leave it there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line988"><a name="pos988"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, proceed please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line989"><a name="pos989"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   I have no further questions, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line990"><a name="pos990"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY ADV ARENDSE.</p>
<p class="line" id="line991"><a name="pos991"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Have you got any re-examination of this witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line992"><a name="pos992"></a>RE-EXAMINATION BY MR PRIOR:	Just one, just one aspect.  The </p>
<p class="line" id="line993"><a name="pos993"></a>widow of your brother, Mrs Cathy Cerqueira indicated that she </p>
<p class="line" id="line994"><a name="pos994"></a>didn't want to attend these proceedings, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line995"><a name="pos995"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line996"><a name="pos996"></a>MR PRIOR:   And are you aware whether she made a statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line997"><a name="pos997"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   I am not aware.</p>
<p class="line" id="line998"><a name="pos998"></a>MR PRIOR:   Thank you.   I have no further questions in re-</p>
<p class="line" id="line999"><a name="pos999"></a>examination, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1000"><a name="pos1000"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR PRIOR</p>
<p class="line" id="line1001"><a name="pos1001"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Will you please look at photograph number 22.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1002"><a name="pos1002"></a>Is that a picture of your restaurant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1003"><a name="pos1003"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1004"><a name="pos1004"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Now, there are three, well I can see but there </p>
<p class="line" id="line1005"><a name="pos1005"></a>are apparently three lines marked "n", do you see those?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1006"><a name="pos1006"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1007"><a name="pos1007"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   And from what I can see in the photograph, two </p>
<p class="line" id="line1008"><a name="pos1008"></a>of them are bullet marks, well the marks made by bullets on the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1009"><a name="pos1009"></a>wall?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1010"><a name="pos1010"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1011"><a name="pos1011"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   One is on the corner of the building, right on </p>
<p class="line" id="line1012"><a name="pos1012"></a>the corner itself it would seem, and one is on the wall leading to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1013"><a name="pos1013"></a>door?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1014"><a name="pos1014"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1015"><a name="pos1015"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   You said something about I thought, think you </p>
<p class="line" id="line1016"><a name="pos1016"></a>said something about bullet marks showing the injury to Brode's leg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1017"><a name="pos1017"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1018"><a name="pos1018"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Was that one of those bullet marks do you </p>
<p class="line" id="line1019"><a name="pos1019"></a>think?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1020"><a name="pos1020"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   The lower one on the corner of the wall Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1021"><a name="pos1021"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   So that bullet mark was caused at the time that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1022"><a name="pos1022"></a>they shot at you and Brode?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1023"><a name="pos1023"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   That is correct, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1024"><a name="pos1024"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Now, at that stage, looking at the picture, it </p>
<p class="line" id="line1025"><a name="pos1025"></a>must mean that the car had already passed your restaurant because </p>
<p class="line" id="line1026"><a name="pos1026"></a>otherwise they couldn't shoot a bullet into that entrance passage </p>
<p class="line" id="line1027"><a name="pos1027"></a>way, could they?  That couldn't have been shot from further up the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1028"><a name="pos1028"></a>road?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1029"><a name="pos1029"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Are you talking about the second shot Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1030"><a name="pos1030"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Yes, the one lower down that you have pointed </p>
<p class="line" id="line1031"><a name="pos1031"></a>out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1032"><a name="pos1032"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Correct, the shots were still being fired after we </p>
<p class="line" id="line1033"><a name="pos1033"></a>had gone into the restaurant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1034"><a name="pos1034"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   They were still firing shots as they were passing </p>
<p class="line" id="line1035"><a name="pos1035"></a>the restaurant?  By that time they were passed the restaurant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1036"><a name="pos1036"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1037"><a name="pos1037"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   And they were firing shots?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1038"><a name="pos1038"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   There were some shots that went into the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1039"><a name="pos1039"></a>restaurant, that hit a table and hit the glass on the top.  As you can </p>
<p class="line" id="line1040"><a name="pos1040"></a>see, there is another mark there, and there is one lower down on the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1041"><a name="pos1041"></a>door that the Police didn't really find.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1042"><a name="pos1042"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   But your brother's body was further up the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1043"><a name="pos1043"></a>road?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1044"><a name="pos1044"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   My brother's body was ... (intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1045"><a name="pos1045"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Where the drainage is shown?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1046"><a name="pos1046"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   (a).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1047"><a name="pos1047"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   On the other side of the traffic light?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1048"><a name="pos1048"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   On this side, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1049"><a name="pos1049"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Just above the traffic light, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1050"><a name="pos1050"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1051"><a name="pos1051"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1052"><a name="pos1052"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   It is about 500 feet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1053"><a name="pos1053"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   500 metres.  Because what causes me some </p>
<p class="line" id="line1054"><a name="pos1054"></a>confusion is that that would indicate that your brother was probably </p>
<p class="line" id="line1055"><a name="pos1055"></a>shot before the car passed the restaurant, wouldn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1056"><a name="pos1056"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Correct, correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1057"><a name="pos1057"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   So that would be before the shots were fired at </p>
<p class="line" id="line1058"><a name="pos1058"></a>you, your brother had been shot further up the road?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1059"><a name="pos1059"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Sorry Sir, I didn't hear that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1060"><a name="pos1060"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   If your brother was shot further up the road, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1061"><a name="pos1061"></a>that was before the shots were fired at you and Mr Brode?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1062"><a name="pos1062"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   If he was shot further up the road?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1063"><a name="pos1063"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1064"><a name="pos1064"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1065"><a name="pos1065"></a>FURTHER CROSS-EXAMINATION ADV ARENDSE:   Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line1066"><a name="pos1066"></a>Chairman, just leading on from Judge Wilson's questions.   Doesn't </p>
<p class="line" id="line1067"><a name="pos1067"></a>that then make it now more than a possibility that your brother ran </p>
<p class="line" id="line1068"><a name="pos1068"></a>out first, he was shot.  He shot at the attackers, he was then shot </p>
<p class="line" id="line1069"><a name="pos1069"></a>and as they continued coming down, by the time you came out, you </p>
<p class="line" id="line1070"><a name="pos1070"></a>were now - the car was now either at the robot or just passed the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1071"><a name="pos1071"></a>robot and this volley of fire may have continued and that is why you </p>
<p class="line" id="line1072"><a name="pos1072"></a>see these marks?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1073"><a name="pos1073"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Sorry, I didn't understand that.  When the car </p>
<p class="line" id="line1074"><a name="pos1074"></a>came passed the restaurant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1075"><a name="pos1075"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Your brother was already shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1076"><a name="pos1076"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1077"><a name="pos1077"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   But your brother was shot further up Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line1078"><a name="pos1078"></a>Cerqueira?  Your brother was lying at the drain.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1079"><a name="pos1079"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   No, my brother was shot between the drain and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1080"><a name="pos1080"></a>that set of robots.  You can see for yourself it is not very far from </p>
<p class="line" id="line1081"><a name="pos1081"></a>the restaurant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1082"><a name="pos1082"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1083"><a name="pos1083"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   It is not very far from the robot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1084"><a name="pos1084"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   But it is further up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1085"><a name="pos1085"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Further up from where?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1086"><a name="pos1086"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Further up from the, it is further up from the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1087"><a name="pos1087"></a>door, not by much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1088"><a name="pos1088"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Sir, it is about the distance from here to there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1089"><a name="pos1089"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Yes, now that is why I am asking you isn't ... </p>
<p class="line" id="line1090"><a name="pos1090"></a>(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1091"><a name="pos1091"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Just hold it.  The witness indicate the distance </p>
<p class="line" id="line1092"><a name="pos1092"></a>between the front door, the front entrance to where your brother </p>
<p class="line" id="line1093"><a name="pos1093"></a>was, is that what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1094"><a name="pos1094"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1095"><a name="pos1095"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   And you point it out as how much?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1096"><a name="pos1096"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   It is about that distance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1097"><a name="pos1097"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   About a meter, Mr Arendse?  Mr Prior?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1098"><a name="pos1098"></a>MR PRIOR:   I understand it to be about a meter, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1099"><a name="pos1099"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Is that the end of it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1100"><a name="pos1100"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   No, I just want to put it to Mr Cerqueira, that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1101"><a name="pos1101"></a>that Mr Cerqueira, strengthens, okay firstly I want to ask you why, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1102"><a name="pos1102"></a>or unless you tell me it was not particularly relevant or you weren't </p>
<p class="line" id="line1103"><a name="pos1103"></a>asked, why are you now mentioning about the, after you saw </p>
<p class="line" id="line1104"><a name="pos1104"></a>photograph number 22, are you mentioning the shots that were fired </p>
<p class="line" id="line1105"><a name="pos1105"></a>through the door and that a glass inside the restaurant was hit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1106"><a name="pos1106"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   If those are in fact the facts, does it really </p>
<p class="line" id="line1107"><a name="pos1107"></a>matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1108"><a name="pos1108"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Nobody bothered to ask him, did they Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line1109"><a name="pos1109"></a>Arendse?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1110"><a name="pos1110"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1111"><a name="pos1111"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   And doesn't the, if you are looking at </p>
<p class="line" id="line1112"><a name="pos1112"></a>photograph 22, it appears to indicate as far as I can see, that that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1113"><a name="pos1113"></a>third line is going to a bullet line through the door, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1114"><a name="pos1114"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   I am not going to pursue this because this is a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1115"><a name="pos1115"></a>different process, otherwise I would have with respect.  I think a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1116"><a name="pos1116"></a>witness is here to tell us what happened, exactly what happened, and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1117"><a name="pos1117"></a>he just didn't mention that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1118"><a name="pos1118"></a>	I think it perhaps effects the other evidence, but that is for </p>
<p class="line" id="line1119"><a name="pos1119"></a>argument, so just leave it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1120"><a name="pos1120"></a>	I just want to put it to you Mr Cerqueira, that it strengthens </p>
<p class="line" id="line1121"><a name="pos1121"></a>the  possibility that your brother must have run out before you, in </p>
<p class="line" id="line1122"><a name="pos1122"></a>front of you, that he was shot in front of Machados, outside of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1123"><a name="pos1123"></a>Machados.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1124"><a name="pos1124"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Machados.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1125"><a name="pos1125"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Machados, yes, and can you explain then how </p>
<p class="line" id="line1126"><a name="pos1126"></a>come you never saw him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1127"><a name="pos1127"></a>MR CERQUEIRA:   Because simply Mr Arendse, he was not in front </p>
<p class="line" id="line1128"><a name="pos1128"></a>of me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1129"><a name="pos1129"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Okay.  I have disputed that already, I have got </p>
<p class="line" id="line1130"><a name="pos1130"></a>no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1131"><a name="pos1131"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY ADV ARENDSE</p>

<p class="line" id="line1137"><a name="pos1137"></a>who is not attending the proceedings.  Would it be appropriate at </p>
<p class="line" id="line1138"><a name="pos1138"></a>this stage to read it onto the record?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1139"><a name="pos1139"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Is it under oath?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1140"><a name="pos1140"></a>MR PRIOR:   No, it is not on oath.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1141"><a name="pos1141"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Well, leave it out then, Mr Prior.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1142"><a name="pos1142"></a>MR PRIOR:   I will see that she makes the oath.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1143"><a name="pos1143"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   If it is relevant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1144"><a name="pos1144"></a>MR PRIOR:   It was her submission as a victim, I thought it may be </p>
<p class="line" id="line1145"><a name="pos1145"></a>appropriate to deal with it, but I will leave it till later.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1146"><a name="pos1146"></a>	Mr Chairman, I indicated in Chambers that the victims had </p>
<p class="line" id="line1147"><a name="pos1147"></a>drafted a letter and wished to place it on record.  May this be an </p>
<p class="line" id="line1148"><a name="pos1148"></a>appropriate stage Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1149"><a name="pos1149"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Can it be done during the evidence that they are </p>
<p class="line" id="line1150"><a name="pos1150"></a>going to give?  Aren't you going to call any witnesses?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1151"><a name="pos1151"></a>MR PRIOR:   Yes, I intend calling Mrs Langford first.  She comes </p>
<p class="line" id="line1152"><a name="pos1152"></a>from Port Elizabeth.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1154"><a name="pos1154"></a>MR PRIOR:   And maybe she can read the statement.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1156"><a name="pos1156"></a>MR PRIOR:   As the Chairman pleases.  I call Mrs Langford.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1164"><a name="pos1164"></a>	"The Heidelberg Tavern attack, amnesty applications.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1165"><a name="pos1165"></a>	We understand the need for unity and reconciliation in our </p>
<p class="line" id="line1166"><a name="pos1166"></a>new nation and that the conflicts and divisions of the past </p>
<p class="line" id="line1167"><a name="pos1167"></a>must at some stage be put behind us in order to achieve the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1168"><a name="pos1168"></a>aim of the amnesty process.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1169"><a name="pos1169"></a>	We also understand that in order to attempt this difficult </p>
<p class="line" id="line1170"><a name="pos1170"></a>journey, the Amnesty Committee ought to have as complete a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1171"><a name="pos1171"></a>picture as possible of the causes, nature and extent of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1172"><a name="pos1172"></a>gross violations of human rights, which in our case relates to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1173"><a name="pos1173"></a>the senseless killings of, and injuries to our sons and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1174"><a name="pos1174"></a>daughters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1175"><a name="pos1175"></a>	We have heard that full disclosure of all relevant facts relating </p>
<p class="line" id="line1176"><a name="pos1176"></a>to the Heidelberg attack is one of the requirements for </p>
<p class="line" id="line1177"><a name="pos1177"></a>amnesty.  This necessarily implies that the truth be told.  We, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1178"><a name="pos1178"></a>as the survivors of this gross violation of human rights, are </p>
<p class="line" id="line1179"><a name="pos1179"></a>deeply concerned by the nature and conduct of these </p>
<p class="line" id="line1180"><a name="pos1180"></a>proceedings thus far.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1181"><a name="pos1181"></a>	Whilst not understanding the finer points of the law, it seems </p>
<p class="line" id="line1182"><a name="pos1182"></a>unfair to us that the Chairman is in open hearing remarked as </p>
<p class="line" id="line1183"><a name="pos1183"></a>follows:-</p>
<p class="line" id="line1184"><a name="pos1184"></a>	Sibaya's evidence was irrelevant to these amnesty </p>
<p class="line" id="line1185"><a name="pos1185"></a>applications.   The kombi must also have been drunk.  He, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1186"><a name="pos1186"></a>Sibaya, probably also knew the name of the name of the sheep, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1187"><a name="pos1187"></a>when he was attempting to answer questions about how he </p>
<p class="line" id="line1188"><a name="pos1188"></a>could remember certain details.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1189"><a name="pos1189"></a>	The reaction of laughter at Sibaya's expense that these </p>
<p class="line" id="line1190"><a name="pos1190"></a>remarks evolved from the legal representatives of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1191"><a name="pos1191"></a>applicants, Dumisa Ntsebeza, and the supporters, we feel </p>
<p class="line" id="line1192"><a name="pos1192"></a>detracts from the serious nature of the amnesty process and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1193"><a name="pos1193"></a>makes light of evidence which we believe is important in </p>
<p class="line" id="line1194"><a name="pos1194"></a>searching for the truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1195"><a name="pos1195"></a>	Such remarks also fail to take into account our pain and our </p>
<p class="line" id="line1196"><a name="pos1196"></a>grief.  It is out of place to listen to these remarks in the same </p>
<p class="line" id="line1197"><a name="pos1197"></a>process as the evidence of the killings of our loved ones.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1198"><a name="pos1198"></a>	We are under the impression from the proceedings thus far, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1199"><a name="pos1199"></a>that the legal representatives are constrained to represent the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1200"><a name="pos1200"></a>minimum facts required to satisfy those requirements for </p>
<p class="line" id="line1201"><a name="pos1201"></a>amnesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1202"><a name="pos1202"></a>	We are all of the view that the proper and full disclosure of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1203"><a name="pos1203"></a>the facts, has not been made.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1204"><a name="pos1204"></a>	We are also concerned about the manner in which Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line1205"><a name="pos1205"></a>Cerqueira was cross-examined, which was in our minds, unfair </p>
<p class="line" id="line1206"><a name="pos1206"></a>and insensitive to his grief and loss.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1207"><a name="pos1207"></a>	We as survivors demand the right to be treated with dignity </p>
<p class="line" id="line1208"><a name="pos1208"></a>and sensitivity if these proceedings are to mean anything at </p>
<p class="line" id="line1209"><a name="pos1209"></a>all.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1210"><a name="pos1210"></a>	Finally, we are present disillusioned about the process we </p>
<p class="line" id="line1211"><a name="pos1211"></a>have seen thus far, and must ask the question whether the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1212"><a name="pos1212"></a>amnesty process is simply part of the political solution </p>
<p class="line" id="line1213"><a name="pos1213"></a>whereby perpetrators of gross violations of human rights will </p>
<p class="line" id="line1214"><a name="pos1214"></a>be granted amnesty as a reward for their loyalty to their </p>
<p class="line" id="line1215"><a name="pos1215"></a>masters. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1216"><a name="pos1216"></a>	We invite the Committee to address our fears and concerns in </p>
<p class="line" id="line1217"><a name="pos1217"></a>this matter".</p>
<p class="line" id="line1218"><a name="pos1218"></a>And we have all signed this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1219"><a name="pos1219"></a>MR PRIOR:   Thank you Mrs Langford.  Mrs Langford, you've also </p>
<p class="line" id="line1220"><a name="pos1220"></a>made submissions in respect of the death of your daughter, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1221"><a name="pos1221"></a>Bernadette, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1222"><a name="pos1222"></a>MRS LANGFORD:   That is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1223"><a name="pos1223"></a>MR PRIOR:   Mr Chairman, may I refer the Committee to item 5 on </p>
<p class="line" id="line1224"><a name="pos1224"></a>the submissions by victims, the Bundle that was prepared and handed </p>
<p class="line" id="line1225"><a name="pos1225"></a>to you, which appears on page 61 to 67.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1226"><a name="pos1226"></a>	Your daughter, Bernadette, she was at the time of her death, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1227"><a name="pos1227"></a>was she still a student at the University?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1228"><a name="pos1228"></a>MRS LANGFORD:   No, she had just received her degree three </p>
<p class="line" id="line1229"><a name="pos1229"></a>weeks before her death.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1230"><a name="pos1230"></a>MR PRIOR:   Had she gained employment or had she taken up </p>
<p class="line" id="line1231"><a name="pos1231"></a>employment at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1232"><a name="pos1232"></a>MRS LANGFORD:   She was busy with a temporary job at Edgars, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1233"><a name="pos1233"></a>Adderley Street, while waiting for replies for her application for a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1234"><a name="pos1234"></a>teaching post.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1235"><a name="pos1235"></a>MR PRIOR:   Was she in any way connected with the military or the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1236"><a name="pos1236"></a>Security Forces at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1237"><a name="pos1237"></a>MRS LANGFORD:   No, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1238"><a name="pos1238"></a>MR PRIOR:   Mrs Langford, you have prepared a submission, have </p>
<p class="line" id="line1239"><a name="pos1239"></a>you not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1240"><a name="pos1240"></a>MRS LANGFORD:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1241"><a name="pos1241"></a>MR PRIOR:   And do you wish those submissions, which are </p>
<p class="line" id="line1242"><a name="pos1242"></a>unsigned, to form part of your evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1243"><a name="pos1243"></a>MRS LANGFORD:   That is right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1244"><a name="pos1244"></a>MR PRIOR:   Could you please look at page 62 and could you tell </p>
<p class="line" id="line1245"><a name="pos1245"></a>the Committee, what kind of person Bernadette was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1246"><a name="pos1246"></a>MRS LANGFORD:   Page 62? </p>
<p class="line" id="line1247"><a name="pos1247"></a>MR PRIOR:   I beg your pardon, I am referring to our Bundle.  You </p>
<p class="line" id="line1248"><a name="pos1248"></a>have your single copy in front of you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1249"><a name="pos1249"></a>MRS LANGFORD:   Yes.  Shall I begin at "Who Bernadette </p>
<p class="line" id="line1250"><a name="pos1250"></a>Langford was"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1251"><a name="pos1251"></a>MR PRIOR:   Yes, please proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1252"><a name="pos1252"></a>MRS LANGFORD:   Right, thank you.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1253"><a name="pos1253"></a>	"Who was Bernadette Langford before?  A talented young </p>
<p class="line" id="line1254"><a name="pos1254"></a>lady on the brink of her career.  The eldest daughter of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1255"><a name="pos1255"></a>Andrea Langford, sister to three sisters and a brother, loved </p>
<p class="line" id="line1256"><a name="pos1256"></a>by her family, friends and all who were privileged to know </p>
<p class="line" id="line1257"><a name="pos1257"></a>her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1258"><a name="pos1258"></a>	On the 9th of December 1993, she had received her higher </p>
<p class="line" id="line1259"><a name="pos1259"></a>diploma in Education post graduate for secondary education.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1260"><a name="pos1260"></a>She completed the prescribed course in the following teaching </p>
<p class="line" id="line1261"><a name="pos1261"></a>subjects:  Art, school counselling and guidance.  She could </p>
<p class="line" id="line1262"><a name="pos1262"></a>also teach through the medium of Afrikaans higher and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1263"><a name="pos1263"></a>English higher.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1264"><a name="pos1264"></a>	Since the very young age of seven, she was capable of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1265"><a name="pos1265"></a>attaining the goals she reached for, such as ballet with </p>
<p class="line" id="line1266"><a name="pos1266"></a>honours and scripture exams with distinction.  Besides her </p>
<p class="line" id="line1267"><a name="pos1267"></a>school studies, which later included drama, this pattern was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1268"><a name="pos1268"></a>pursued while at University.  Her first three years were at </p>
<p class="line" id="line1269"><a name="pos1269"></a>Rhodes University where she received her BA degree in fine </p>
<p class="line" id="line1270"><a name="pos1270"></a>art and psychology.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1271"><a name="pos1271"></a>	And at the same time, she was a keen sportswoman.  That was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1272"><a name="pos1272"></a>in volley ball.  She also completed an advance course in </p>
<p class="line" id="line1273"><a name="pos1273"></a>deportment, beauty rooting, fashion and photographic </p>
<p class="line" id="line1274"><a name="pos1274"></a>modelling.  She had also done a St John's ambulance course.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1275"><a name="pos1275"></a>Bernadette had one desire, and that was to enrich our society </p>
<p class="line" id="line1276"><a name="pos1276"></a>with her abilities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1277"><a name="pos1277"></a>	She had a great love for children and a compassion for the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1278"><a name="pos1278"></a>misunderstood.  She was working on a casual basis at Edgars, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1279"><a name="pos1279"></a>Adderley Street, while waiting for a reply from her </p>
<p class="line" id="line1280"><a name="pos1280"></a>applications for a teaching post.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1281"><a name="pos1281"></a>	She undertook to care for the family and had plans to support </p>
<p class="line" id="line1282"><a name="pos1282"></a>her brother's education.  She had hopes of raising a family of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1283"><a name="pos1283"></a>her own one day.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1284"><a name="pos1284"></a>	The incident.  On the 30th of December 1993, Bernadette's </p>
<p class="line" id="line1285"><a name="pos1285"></a>friends decided to stop at the Heidelberg Tavern in </p>
<p class="line" id="line1286"><a name="pos1286"></a>Observatory for eats and while there, she was gunned down </p>
<p class="line" id="line1287"><a name="pos1287"></a>with automatic gun fire, according to reports.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1288"><a name="pos1288"></a>	Extent of injuries.  During the early hours of the 31st of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1289"><a name="pos1289"></a>December 1993, Bernadette had lost her life.  She, who </p>
<p class="line" id="line1290"><a name="pos1290"></a>showed mercy to others, was not given that chance.   An </p>
<p class="line" id="line1291"><a name="pos1291"></a>innocent human being".  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1292"><a name="pos1292"></a>I approve of the statements made and the copies, I can give to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1293"><a name="pos1293"></a>MR PRIOR:   Yes, that is not necessary at this stage, they will be </p>
<p class="line" id="line1294"><a name="pos1294"></a>handed in Mrs Langford.  Please continue.  Are you able to continue </p>
<p class="line" id="line1295"><a name="pos1295"></a>at this stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1296"><a name="pos1296"></a>MRS LANGFORD:   Yes, I can, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1297"><a name="pos1297"></a>MR PRIOR:   Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1298"><a name="pos1298"></a>MRS LANGFORD:   Who is Bernadette Langford now?  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1299"><a name="pos1299"></a>	"Bernadette has gone to be with The Father.  She lives </p>
<p class="line" id="line1300"><a name="pos1300"></a>on in our memories.  Though the last memory of her causes us </p>
<p class="line" id="line1301"><a name="pos1301"></a>to sorrow, not as the world, but with the hope of everlasting </p>
<p class="line" id="line1302"><a name="pos1302"></a>life.  I know if she was here, she would want us to hold onto </p>
<p class="line" id="line1303"><a name="pos1303"></a>the truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1304"><a name="pos1304"></a>	The loss to the family came at a time when funds were </p>
<p class="line" id="line1305"><a name="pos1305"></a>exhausted.  I, her mother, had to come up to Cape Town and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1306"><a name="pos1306"></a>identify her and do the necessary arrangements for her burial </p>
<p class="line" id="line1307"><a name="pos1307"></a>in Port Elizabeth.  This was very difficult at the time as I was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1308"><a name="pos1308"></a>unemployed, due to the fact that I had given up my work the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1309"><a name="pos1309"></a>previous year, to sort out our family matters after her father's </p>
<p class="line" id="line1310"><a name="pos1310"></a>sudden death due to respiratory failure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1311"><a name="pos1311"></a>	His small business had to be shut down and I had not </p>
<p class="line" id="line1312"><a name="pos1312"></a>recovered from these losses, when this tragedy struck the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1313"><a name="pos1313"></a>family.  Family and friends rallied around at the time, I thank </p>
<p class="line" id="line1314"><a name="pos1314"></a>God for them.  I was told that a fund had been established to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1315"><a name="pos1315"></a>assist the families, but this came to nought - up to this very </p>
<p class="line" id="line1316"><a name="pos1316"></a>hour, I have never been assisted in any way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1317"><a name="pos1317"></a>	I feel I have the right to ask what is the right of human life, is </p>
<p class="line" id="line1318"><a name="pos1318"></a>it not to be given a free chance to live?  This is what I would </p>
<p class="line" id="line1319"><a name="pos1319"></a>say if I were given the opportunity to make the statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1320"><a name="pos1320"></a>	The past four years have been exceptionally difficult since </p>
<p class="line" id="line1321"><a name="pos1321"></a>Bernadette's death.  As a result, we had to deal with many </p>
<p class="line" id="line1322"><a name="pos1322"></a>frustrations such as continually being asked about our feelings </p>
<p class="line" id="line1323"><a name="pos1323"></a>and our view concerning the way in which she died because </p>
<p class="line" id="line1324"><a name="pos1324"></a>the community where I live, could not accept the way in which </p>
<p class="line" id="line1325"><a name="pos1325"></a>she died.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1326"><a name="pos1326"></a>	My relatives all suffered emotionally because of the trauma </p>
<p class="line" id="line1327"><a name="pos1327"></a>and they knew that because of our culture in which we care </p>
<p class="line" id="line1328"><a name="pos1328"></a>for the one who cares for you, this was not going to happen.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1329"><a name="pos1329"></a>I asked God for inner strength and the courage to forgive </p>
<p class="line" id="line1330"><a name="pos1330"></a>which I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1331"><a name="pos1331"></a>	I had to remember to lead by example, which the rest of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1332"><a name="pos1332"></a>family would follow.  The hardships have not ended because </p>
<p class="line" id="line1333"><a name="pos1333"></a>life has become more expensive.  I have a casual job since last </p>
<p class="line" id="line1334"><a name="pos1334"></a>year, which is a blessing in a small way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1335"><a name="pos1335"></a>	The men who shot Bernadette, have to understand that we </p>
<p class="line" id="line1336"><a name="pos1336"></a>forgave them as a family, but this shouldn't prevent justice </p>
<p class="line" id="line1337"><a name="pos1337"></a>from taking place.  I wish to say to the Truth and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1338"><a name="pos1338"></a>Reconciliation Commission and all who are assembled here for </p>
<p class="line" id="line1339"><a name="pos1339"></a>the Heidelberg Tavern hearing, man can do what is humanly </p>
<p class="line" id="line1340"><a name="pos1340"></a>possible, but God can do the impossible to reconcile man to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1341"><a name="pos1341"></a>God.  To the ones who sent you, you planted the seed and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1342"><a name="pos1342"></a>watered it, you saw it grow, so you are very much part of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1343"><a name="pos1343"></a>end result, but I tell you too, there is a way to find peace of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1344"><a name="pos1344"></a>mind - may God grant you the wisdom to understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1345"><a name="pos1345"></a>MR PRIOR:   Mrs Langford, do you confirm the statement that you </p>
<p class="line" id="line1346"><a name="pos1346"></a>have read out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1347"><a name="pos1347"></a>MRS LANGFORD:   I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1348"><a name="pos1348"></a>MR PRIOR:   And you adhere to its contents?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1349"><a name="pos1349"></a>MRS LANGFORD:   I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1350"><a name="pos1350"></a>MR PRIOR:   Is there anything in addition thereto, that you wish to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1351"><a name="pos1351"></a>say regarding the amnesty application?  Do you oppose it or do you </p>
<p class="line" id="line1352"><a name="pos1352"></a>agree with it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1353"><a name="pos1353"></a>MRS LANGFORD:   Before I answer you on whether I oppose it or </p>
<p class="line" id="line1354"><a name="pos1354"></a>agree with it, I want to add to a note that I have just written out as </p>
<p class="line" id="line1355"><a name="pos1355"></a>I was listening if I may.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1356"><a name="pos1356"></a>MR PRIOR:   Please continue Mrs Langford.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1357"><a name="pos1357"></a>MRS LANGFORD:   Mr Chairman, these are the perpetrators of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1358"><a name="pos1358"></a>gross human violations.  They say as you have heard, that they were </p>
<p class="line" id="line1359"><a name="pos1359"></a>acting under orders.  Just a question I would like to ask is why </p>
<p class="line" id="line1360"><a name="pos1360"></a>haven't their instructors not been brought before this Commission, if </p>
<p class="line" id="line1361"><a name="pos1361"></a>I may ask and if we as the victims, have to reconcile, then the truth </p>
<p class="line" id="line1362"><a name="pos1362"></a>of the matter is we will never know who was behind the hideous </p>
<p class="line" id="line1363"><a name="pos1363"></a>atrocity and we will leave this place with a half truth.  I speak for </p>
<p class="line" id="line1364"><a name="pos1364"></a>myself, but this is the feeling shared by the victims of the Heidelberg </p>
<p class="line" id="line1365"><a name="pos1365"></a>Tavern.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1366"><a name="pos1366"></a>	I will explain why I say that justice in case I am questioned on </p>
<p class="line" id="line1367"><a name="pos1367"></a>that, why justice having to be carried out.  I have forgiven them so I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1368"><a name="pos1368"></a>will explain that line.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1369"><a name="pos1369"></a>	I will just go on from here.  I feel that justice is that all </p>
<p class="line" id="line1370"><a name="pos1370"></a>aspects concerning this case, to me, that is not only the applicants, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1371"><a name="pos1371"></a>but the ones who gave the orders, they have the full knowledge of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1372"><a name="pos1372"></a>why this really happened.  If they can be brought here or at a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1373"><a name="pos1373"></a>separate hearing, we will be satisfied as I said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1374"><a name="pos1374"></a>	And as I will say to the applicants, as I heard all the time, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1375"><a name="pos1375"></a>they acted under orders which I understand.  I too, act under orders </p>
<p class="line" id="line1376"><a name="pos1376"></a>as I sit here now, just speaking directly to you because I firmly </p>
<p class="line" id="line1377"><a name="pos1377"></a>would like to believe that we all do believe there is a God above our </p>
<p class="line" id="line1378"><a name="pos1378"></a>heads.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1379"><a name="pos1379"></a>	If I can be allowed to say this, and because I believe that God </p>
<p class="line" id="line1380"><a name="pos1380"></a>is God and I act under His orders and for me, His orders are to say </p>
<p class="line" id="line1381"><a name="pos1381"></a>to you and to all here, yes, I have forgiven you.  I will not oppose </p>
<p class="line" id="line1382"><a name="pos1382"></a>your amnesty because who am I, I am not your judge.  I can never </p>
<p class="line" id="line1383"><a name="pos1383"></a>judge you, but there is a way to find the freedom more than amnesty </p>
<p class="line" id="line1384"><a name="pos1384"></a>can free you from. And that is if you give your hearts to Him.  And </p>
<p class="line" id="line1385"><a name="pos1385"></a>you truly believe that He did send his Son for all of us here present, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1386"><a name="pos1386"></a>not only for a sinner, but for all and you give your hearts to Him, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1387"><a name="pos1387"></a>you will find the peace that I have found, with which I can say to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1388"><a name="pos1388"></a>you I have forgiven you and I will not oppose your amnesty.  Then </p>
<p class="line" id="line1389"><a name="pos1389"></a>you will know what I know regardless of how I feel, regardless of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1390"><a name="pos1390"></a>the three years and ten months that I thought I put behind my back </p>
<p class="line" id="line1391"><a name="pos1391"></a>and that I thought I had dealt with quite well, but that was brought </p>
<p class="line" id="line1392"><a name="pos1392"></a>back to me because of your application for amnesty.	It just </p>
<p class="line" id="line1393"><a name="pos1393"></a>brought back everything, it put me right back to where I had thought </p>
<p class="line" id="line1394"><a name="pos1394"></a>I had gone past, but my heart will feel satisfied to know if you can </p>
<p class="line" id="line1395"><a name="pos1395"></a>receive that.  And I think that is all I would like to say here.  Thank </p>
<p class="line" id="line1396"><a name="pos1396"></a>you.  I would like to thank Mr Chairman, for giving me that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1397"><a name="pos1397"></a>opportunity.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1398"><a name="pos1398"></a>MR PRIOR:   Mrs Langford, you've indicated the financial hardship </p>
<p class="line" id="line1399"><a name="pos1399"></a>that the family suffered?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1400"><a name="pos1400"></a>MRS LANGFORD:   That is so, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1401"><a name="pos1401"></a>MR PRIOR:   As a result of Bernadette's passing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1402"><a name="pos1402"></a>MRS LANGFORD:   That is so, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1403"><a name="pos1403"></a>MR PRIOR:   If I could just be permitted on one aspect, her </p>
<p class="line" id="line1404"><a name="pos1404"></a>education was paid for by whom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1405"><a name="pos1405"></a>MRS LANGFORD:   I paid for her education.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1406"><a name="pos1406"></a>MR PRIOR:   And what was the understanding with Bernadette once </p>
<p class="line" id="line1407"><a name="pos1407"></a>she had obtained employment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1408"><a name="pos1408"></a>MRS LANGFORD:   Because I had to go to various lengths to be </p>
<p class="line" id="line1409"><a name="pos1409"></a>able to ascertain Bernadette's qualifying, this is very personal, go </p>
<p class="line" id="line1410"><a name="pos1410"></a>into my personal life.  I had to give her things like my policies to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1411"><a name="pos1411"></a>ensure that Bernadette could get through, it was very difficulty, as I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1412"><a name="pos1412"></a>have explained earlier.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1413"><a name="pos1413"></a>	And Bernadette gave me the assurance that on so doing, that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1414"><a name="pos1414"></a>she would look after me, and not only that, she would educate her </p>
<p class="line" id="line1415"><a name="pos1415"></a>little brother who was seven when his dad died and then he was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1416"><a name="pos1416"></a>eight when Bernadette died.  I can't imagine what, I try to think </p>
<p class="line" id="line1417"><a name="pos1417"></a>what he must be thinking and feeling, but I don't think I can actually </p>
<p class="line" id="line1418"><a name="pos1418"></a>imagine what he must be going through.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1419"><a name="pos1419"></a>MR PRIOR:   You indicated that since the loss of Bernadette, you </p>
<p class="line" id="line1420"><a name="pos1420"></a>received no financial support from the State whatsoever?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1421"><a name="pos1421"></a>MRS LANGFORD:   None, whatsoever.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1422"><a name="pos1422"></a>MR PRIOR:   You indicated to me before you were called to testify, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1423"><a name="pos1423"></a>that was some days ago, that you would like the matter, your </p>
<p class="line" id="line1424"><a name="pos1424"></a>particular case to be referred to the Reparations  Committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1425"><a name="pos1425"></a>MRS LANGFORD:   That is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1426"><a name="pos1426"></a>MR PRIOR:   Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1427"><a name="pos1427"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR PRIOR</p>
<p class="line" id="line1428"><a name="pos1428"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Are there any questions, Mr Arendse?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1429"><a name="pos1429"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   None, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1430"><a name="pos1430"></a>NO CROSS-EXAMINATION BY ADV ARENDSE</p>
<p class="line" id="line1431"><a name="pos1431"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   I have read the statement that you and other </p>
<p class="line" id="line1432"><a name="pos1432"></a>victims and relatives have signed.  Without any reservation, I want </p>
<p class="line" id="line1433"><a name="pos1433"></a>to say that I am sorry if my remarks have caused you any hurt, they </p>
<p class="line" id="line1434"><a name="pos1434"></a>weren't intended to hurt you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1435"><a name="pos1435"></a>MRS LANGFORD:   Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1436"><a name="pos1436"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   They certainly were not intended in any way to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1437"><a name="pos1437"></a>hurt you.  I want to assure you that I am sensitive to the feelings of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1438"><a name="pos1438"></a>people who have been injured in the tragedy that has taken place in </p>
<p class="line" id="line1439"><a name="pos1439"></a>our country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1440"><a name="pos1440"></a>	I have been entrusted like the other members of the Amnesty </p>
<p class="line" id="line1441"><a name="pos1441"></a>Committee, to hear applications, we have been doing that for more </p>
<p class="line" id="line1442"><a name="pos1442"></a>than a year now, nearly two years.  We had been hearing harrowing </p>
<p class="line" id="line1443"><a name="pos1443"></a>accounts of terrible deeds committed by applicants in Cape Town </p>
<p class="line" id="line1444"><a name="pos1444"></a>and in other parts of the work, we have listened as patiently as we </p>
<p class="line" id="line1445"><a name="pos1445"></a>can to these details.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1446"><a name="pos1446"></a>	We have afforded the applicants every opportunity to put </p>
<p class="line" id="line1447"><a name="pos1447"></a>forward their case, because the law requires that they should be </p>
<p class="line" id="line1448"><a name="pos1448"></a>given a hearing.  We have never held back requests by victims and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1449"><a name="pos1449"></a>dependants to express their feelings in the matters that we had to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1450"><a name="pos1450"></a>deal with.  And if my remarks, have conveyed to you and the other </p>
<p class="line" id="line1451"><a name="pos1451"></a>parents and victims, that I am not sensitive to your hurt and your </p>
<p class="line" id="line1452"><a name="pos1452"></a>feelings, I am sorry for that.  I want to assure you that that was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1453"><a name="pos1453"></a>furthest from my mind.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1454"><a name="pos1454"></a>	Such remarks as I may have made, at the time, about the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1455"><a name="pos1455"></a>evidence that was given by Mr Sibaya, were as a result of a lengthy </p>
<p class="line" id="line1456"><a name="pos1456"></a>hearing on evidence in a matter which was only tangentially related </p>
<p class="line" id="line1457"><a name="pos1457"></a>to the issues before this Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1458"><a name="pos1458"></a>	I haven't made up my mind, we haven't considered the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1459"><a name="pos1459"></a>evidence and we haven't rejected the evidence of any witness who </p>
<p class="line" id="line1460"><a name="pos1460"></a>has given evidence before us.  We will only be considering the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1461"><a name="pos1461"></a>evidence and evaluating the evidence and coming to a final </p>
<p class="line" id="line1462"><a name="pos1462"></a>conclusion after all the evidence have been led and counsel on both </p>
<p class="line" id="line1463"><a name="pos1463"></a>sides have had an opportunity of addressing us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1464"><a name="pos1464"></a>	Finally, to you and your colleagues, once more, I say that if </p>
<p class="line" id="line1465"><a name="pos1465"></a>my remarks may have seemed injudicious to you, I am sorry for that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1466"><a name="pos1466"></a>MRS LANGFORD:   I thank you for your explanation and I fully </p>
<p class="line" id="line1467"><a name="pos1467"></a>accept what you have just told me, Judge Mall, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1468"><a name="pos1468"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   You are excused from further attendance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1469"><a name="pos1469"></a>MRS LANGFORD:   Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1470"><a name="pos1470"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line1471"><a name="pos1471"></a>MR PRIOR:   Mr Chairman, will this be an opportune stage to take a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1472"><a name="pos1472"></a>short adjournment.  I have my next witness, Mr Cornelius.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1473"><a name="pos1473"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, we will take a short adjournment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1474"><a name="pos1474"></a>COMMISSION ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line1475"><a name="pos1475"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line1476"><a name="pos1476"></a>MR PRIOR:   Mr Chairman, I call Mrs Fourie.   Mr Chairman, Mrs </p>
<p class="line" id="line1477"><a name="pos1477"></a>Fourie had requested to sit a little closer to the applicants, and I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1478"><a name="pos1478"></a>understand there is no objection to that, if that pleases the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1479"><a name="pos1479"></a>Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1480"><a name="pos1480"></a>JEANETTE ANNE FOURIE:	(sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1481"><a name="pos1481"></a>MR PRIOR:   Mr Chairman, the witness has not made submissions, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1482"><a name="pos1482"></a>her husband in fact, made written submissions, but she requested an </p>
<p class="line" id="line1483"><a name="pos1483"></a>opportunity to address the Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1484"><a name="pos1484"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Prior.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1485"><a name="pos1485"></a>EXAMINATION BY MR PRIOR:	Mrs Fourie, is it correct that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1486"><a name="pos1486"></a>your daughter was killed in the Heidelberg Tavern attack on the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1487"><a name="pos1487"></a>30th of December 1993?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1488"><a name="pos1488"></a>MRS FOURIE:   That is correct, Lindi Anne was killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1489"><a name="pos1489"></a>MR PRIOR:   Would you please continue, or proceed with what you </p>
<p class="line" id="line1490"><a name="pos1490"></a>want to address the Committee on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1491"><a name="pos1491"></a>MRS FOURIE:   I would like to address the Committee, Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line1492"><a name="pos1492"></a>Chairman, but a bit more personally, I would like to address the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1493"><a name="pos1493"></a>gentlemen before us and if you don't mind being onlookers whilst I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1494"><a name="pos1494"></a>do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1495"><a name="pos1495"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Please proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1496"><a name="pos1496"></a>MRS FOURIE:   Molweni amadoda.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1497"><a name="pos1497"></a>APPLICANTS:	Good morning Mama.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1498"><a name="pos1498"></a>MRS FOURIE:   I am very sorry, that I can't express my thoughts </p>
<p class="line" id="line1499"><a name="pos1499"></a>and feelings in Xhosa.  I think you remember me.  At the criminal </p>
<p class="line" id="line1500"><a name="pos1500"></a>trial, I asked the translator to tell you that I had forgiven you.  Do </p>
<p class="line" id="line1501"><a name="pos1501"></a>you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1502"><a name="pos1502"></a>APPLICANTS:	Yes, we remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1503"><a name="pos1503"></a>MRS FOURIE:   And I shook your hand.   Mr Gqomfa, was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1504"><a name="pos1504"></a>unwilling and he looked the other way, but I certainly shook Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line1505"><a name="pos1505"></a>Mabala and Mr Madasi's hands.  Nothing has changed, I still feel </p>
<p class="line" id="line1506"><a name="pos1506"></a>exactly the same way and I do forgive you because my High </p>
<p class="line" id="line1507"><a name="pos1507"></a>Command, demonstrated to me how to do that by forgiving his </p>
<p class="line" id="line1508"><a name="pos1508"></a>killers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1509"><a name="pos1509"></a>	I want to tell you who Lindi was.  She was known as Lindiwe </p>
<p class="line" id="line1510"><a name="pos1510"></a>by her Xhosa friends.  Lindi was a true child of Africa.  She was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1511"><a name="pos1511"></a>happiest hiking in the mountains, riding a horse with her dog out in </p>
<p class="line" id="line1512"><a name="pos1512"></a>the countryside.  She was just finishing a Bachelor of Science in </p>
<p class="line" id="line1513"><a name="pos1513"></a>Civil Engineering and had spent a lot of time designing and thinking </p>
<p class="line" id="line1514"><a name="pos1514"></a>about how it would be possible to improve the infrastructure in </p>
<p class="line" id="line1515"><a name="pos1515"></a>places like Khayelitsha, so that running water and waterborne </p>
<p class="line" id="line1516"><a name="pos1516"></a>sewerage would be available, to people who have been oppressed </p>
<p class="line" id="line1517"><a name="pos1517"></a>and discriminated against.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1518"><a name="pos1518"></a>	She had spent her vacations with one of the big engineering </p>
<p class="line" id="line1519"><a name="pos1519"></a>companies in the Western Cape, and during lunch time the black men </p>
<p class="line" id="line1520"><a name="pos1520"></a>would come and tell her about their lives.  She would come home in </p>
<p class="line" id="line1521"><a name="pos1521"></a>the evenings, and tell me the tragic stories of hopelessness and the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1522"><a name="pos1522"></a>despair that they felt in never being able to get further than being </p>
<p class="line" id="line1523"><a name="pos1523"></a>labourers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1524"><a name="pos1524"></a>	She understood that.  She wept to know that that was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1525"><a name="pos1525"></a>happening in her country.  She helped me to understand how subtle </p>
<p class="line" id="line1526"><a name="pos1526"></a>my prejudice and bias and racial discrimination was.  But it was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1527"><a name="pos1527"></a>nothing blatant, it was in the very, very subtle fibres of my being.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1528"><a name="pos1528"></a>She helped me to understand that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1529"><a name="pos1529"></a>	She was totally willing to treat everyone as an equal and she </p>
<p class="line" id="line1530"><a name="pos1530"></a>did that openly and freely.  Her black friends were as important to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1531"><a name="pos1531"></a>her as her white friends.  	Lindiwe could have been your friend. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1532"><a name="pos1532"></a> You did your own cause immeasurable harm by killing her.  She was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1533"><a name="pos1533"></a>totally opposed to violence.  She was a gentle person who cared for </p>
<p class="line" id="line1534"><a name="pos1534"></a>not only the people, not only the little people, but the animals and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1535"><a name="pos1535"></a>the flowers, the ecology of our country and the world.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1536"><a name="pos1536"></a>	As a medical person, I had to go straight back into the wards </p>
<p class="line" id="line1537"><a name="pos1537"></a>of Groote Schuur and treat your colleagues who had been shot and I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1538"><a name="pos1538"></a>needed to do that without showing any bitterness or resentment.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1539"><a name="pos1539"></a>God gave me that grace.  	I think the reason that I am here, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1540"><a name="pos1540"></a>have been here through this week and particularly today which is </p>
<p class="line" id="line1541"><a name="pos1541"></a>very important to me, is to tell you that on that day you ripped my </p>
<p class="line" id="line1542"><a name="pos1542"></a>heart out.  Lindi was one of the most precious people and I am </p>
<p class="line" id="line1543"><a name="pos1543"></a>biased because she was my daughter, that this country could have </p>
<p class="line" id="line1544"><a name="pos1544"></a>produced.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1545"><a name="pos1545"></a>	I resent being called a victim, I have a choice in the matter.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1546"><a name="pos1546"></a>am a survivor.  Lindi was a victim, she had no choice.  I have just </p>
<p class="line" id="line1547"><a name="pos1547"></a>had major surgery, which I trace as a direct result to the stress and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1548"><a name="pos1548"></a>trauma that resulted out of the Heidelberg incident.   It has been </p>
<p class="line" id="line1549"><a name="pos1549"></a>demonstrated that cancer of the colon is something that results from </p>
<p class="line" id="line1550"><a name="pos1550"></a>tremendous stress.  So first my heart was ripped out, and now half </p>
<p class="line" id="line1551"><a name="pos1551"></a>of my gut.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1552"><a name="pos1552"></a>	I am happy that you are well, I hope that emotionally and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1553"><a name="pos1553"></a>psychologically you can be well because my greatest concern is that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1554"><a name="pos1554"></a>you have been programmed killers, you repeatedly said that you </p>
<p class="line" id="line1555"><a name="pos1555"></a>were acting under orders from your high command.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1556"><a name="pos1556"></a>	You could not tell us how you felt which indicates to me that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1557"><a name="pos1557"></a>possibly you have been trained not to feel and I can see that that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1558"><a name="pos1558"></a>would be important in a killing machine, to be unable to feel, but </p>
<p class="line" id="line1559"><a name="pos1559"></a>just to carry out orders indiscriminately.   And that is my greatest </p>
<p class="line" id="line1560"><a name="pos1560"></a>fear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1561"><a name="pos1561"></a>	I have no objection to amnesty for you, but we know there are </p>
<p class="line" id="line1562"><a name="pos1562"></a>enough indiscriminate killers on our streets and my fear is that we </p>
<p class="line" id="line1563"><a name="pos1563"></a>have three more who are capable, because of their programming to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1564"><a name="pos1564"></a>do exactly the same thing once you are released.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1565"><a name="pos1565"></a>	I wished that it could be otherwise and perhaps with time and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1566"><a name="pos1566"></a>counselling things can be otherwise, and I would wish that that is </p>
<p class="line" id="line1567"><a name="pos1567"></a>possible and that it is made available to you as it has been made </p>
<p class="line" id="line1568"><a name="pos1568"></a>available to us, to have counselling for the tremendous trauma that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1569"><a name="pos1569"></a>we have been through and I am sure you have been through trauma </p>
<p class="line" id="line1570"><a name="pos1570"></a>as well.	Both through the incident and through your own </p>
<p class="line" id="line1571"><a name="pos1571"></a>experiences, which Lindiwe would have been delighted to hear and I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1572"><a name="pos1572"></a>would be also interested in hearing how you experienced oppression </p>
<p class="line" id="line1573"><a name="pos1573"></a>personally.  I have experienced oppression as a white woman and I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1574"><a name="pos1574"></a>am sure the oppression that you have experienced, may be much </p>
<p class="line" id="line1575"><a name="pos1575"></a>worse.  But I would like to know the details because that is what </p>
<p class="line" id="line1576"><a name="pos1576"></a>Lindi would have wanted to know too.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1577"><a name="pos1577"></a>	We came here hoping to hear the truth about who the people </p>
<p class="line" id="line1578"><a name="pos1578"></a>in high command were who organised this whole dastedly affair.   I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1579"><a name="pos1579"></a>am not convinced that that truth has come out and until it is, and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1580"><a name="pos1580"></a>does come out, I am not happy that you could just disappear into the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1581"><a name="pos1581"></a>woodwork.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1582"><a name="pos1582"></a>	I know that it must be terribly frightening to reveal who the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1583"><a name="pos1583"></a>high command is because your own lives are in jeopardy if you do </p>
<p class="line" id="line1584"><a name="pos1584"></a>get amnesty, and I appreciate that it must be very, very frightening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1585"><a name="pos1585"></a>	I thank you for being able to look me in the eye and for </p>
<p class="line" id="line1586"><a name="pos1586"></a>having to hear my story.  Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1587"><a name="pos1587"></a>MR PRIOR:   There is nothing further Mr Chairman, from this </p>
<p class="line" id="line1588"><a name="pos1588"></a>witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1589"><a name="pos1589"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR PRIOR</p>
<p class="line" id="line1590"><a name="pos1590"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Arendse, are there any questions you wish to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1591"><a name="pos1591"></a>put to this witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1592"><a name="pos1592"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   No, Mr Chairman, there are just two things I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1593"><a name="pos1593"></a>would like to mention maybe for the record.  The first one is that in </p>
<p class="line" id="line1594"><a name="pos1594"></a>terms of Mrs Fourie saying that she hasn't had everything, we've </p>
<p class="line" id="line1595"><a name="pos1595"></a>only got three applicants here before us and they have said what </p>
<p class="line" id="line1596"><a name="pos1596"></a>they did, including killing her daughter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1597"><a name="pos1597"></a>	The other thing is it is a matter of record, certainly it is in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1598"><a name="pos1598"></a>bundle that is before the Committee, that the APLA high command </p>
<p class="line" id="line1599"><a name="pos1599"></a>and this is what I am not sure about, the APLA high command is on </p>
<p class="line" id="line1600"><a name="pos1600"></a>record when they made submissions to the TRC Committee, I think, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1601"><a name="pos1601"></a>on the 7th of October, as having accepted responsibility for what </p>
<p class="line" id="line1602"><a name="pos1602"></a>happened and there is also a statement that we put to the applicants </p>
<p class="line" id="line1603"><a name="pos1603"></a>which had been handed up on behalf of Mr Xuma where he says as a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1604"><a name="pos1604"></a>member of the APLA high command they accept responsibility and it </p>
<p class="line" id="line1605"><a name="pos1605"></a>is also clear that they were the ones, including Mr Xuma, who had in </p>
<p class="line" id="line1606"><a name="pos1606"></a>fact organised this attack.  So that is a matter of record.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1607"><a name="pos1607"></a>	I am not sure whether Mrs Fourie is aware of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1608"><a name="pos1608"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   They are accepting responsibility for what has </p>
<p class="line" id="line1609"><a name="pos1609"></a>happened, appears from the papers, but we have to decide whether </p>
<p class="line" id="line1610"><a name="pos1610"></a>we would like to call the person who gave the orders to appear </p>
<p class="line" id="line1611"><a name="pos1611"></a>before us for having given the orders and to explain why he gave </p>
<p class="line" id="line1612"><a name="pos1612"></a>such orders.  We haven't decided that, we may very well decide that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1613"><a name="pos1613"></a>we would like to hear that evidence, if not now, but at some stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1614"><a name="pos1614"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Well, the evidence thus far, which is </p>
<p class="line" id="line1615"><a name="pos1615"></a>unchallenged, is that Mr Gqomfa got his orders directly from Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line1616"><a name="pos1616"></a>Nonxuba who unfortunately is deceased and the other applicants </p>
<p class="line" id="line1617"><a name="pos1617"></a>Mabala and Madasi have said that they received their orders from Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line1618"><a name="pos1618"></a>Gqomfa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1619"><a name="pos1619"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   We will deal with that during your address.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1620"><a name="pos1620"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   As you please Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1621"><a name="pos1621"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1622"><a name="pos1622"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   The statement by Xuma which you referred to, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1623"><a name="pos1623"></a>which is being handed in, is not an affidavit.  It is merely a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1624"><a name="pos1624"></a>statement prepared by him and signed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1625"><a name="pos1625"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Anyway that is a matter we will deal with at a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1626"><a name="pos1626"></a>later stage.  If there are no further points you would like to put to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1627"><a name="pos1627"></a>Mrs Fourie, then I would like to excuse her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1628"><a name="pos1628"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   No, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1629"><a name="pos1629"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Mrs Fourie, thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1630"><a name="pos1630"></a>MRS FOURIE:   Mr Chairman, may I respond to Mr Arendse's </p>
<p class="line" id="line1631"><a name="pos1631"></a>comment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1632"><a name="pos1632"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1633"><a name="pos1633"></a>MRS FOURIE:   Yes, I do understand that the PAC as a group, have </p>
<p class="line" id="line1634"><a name="pos1634"></a>taken responsibility, but have the people who were directly involved </p>
<p class="line" id="line1635"><a name="pos1635"></a>with planning this whole thing, and getting these gentlemen to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1636"><a name="pos1636"></a>execute the orders, they are the people that we want to know about </p>
<p class="line" id="line1637"><a name="pos1637"></a>and have they applied for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1638"><a name="pos1638"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   These are factors which we will be considering.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1639"><a name="pos1639"></a>MRS FOURIE:   We appreciate that Mr Chairman, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1640"><a name="pos1640"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1641"><a name="pos1641"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line1642"><a name="pos1642"></a>MR PRIOR:   Thank you Mr Chairman, I call the next witness, Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line1643"><a name="pos1643"></a>Quentin Cornelius.  Mr Cornelius is in a wheelchair, and I think it </p>
<p class="line" id="line1644"><a name="pos1644"></a>may be convenient, Mr Chairman, for him to sit where Mrs Fourie </p>
<p class="line" id="line1645"><a name="pos1645"></a>sat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1646"><a name="pos1646"></a>	He appears at item 2 of the submissions by victims Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line1647"><a name="pos1647"></a>Chairman, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1648"><a name="pos1648"></a>QUENTIN CORNELIUS:	(sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1649"><a name="pos1649"></a>EXAMINATION BY MR PRIOR:	Mr Cornelius, thank you for </p>
<p class="line" id="line1650"><a name="pos1650"></a>appearing.  Is it correct that you have prepared your own </p>
<p class="line" id="line1651"><a name="pos1651"></a>submissions which form part of the Bundle of documents that was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1652"><a name="pos1652"></a>handed up to the Committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1653"><a name="pos1653"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1654"><a name="pos1654"></a>MR PRIOR:   Do you have a copy of the submissions that you intend </p>
<p class="line" id="line1655"><a name="pos1655"></a>to present in your evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1656"><a name="pos1656"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1657"><a name="pos1657"></a>MR PRIOR:   And you wish those submissions to be incorporated as </p>
<p class="line" id="line1658"><a name="pos1658"></a>part of your evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1659"><a name="pos1659"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1660"><a name="pos1660"></a>MR PRIOR:   Just for the record, how old are you now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1661"><a name="pos1661"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   I am 24 years.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1662"><a name="pos1662"></a>MR PRIOR:   Are you married?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1663"><a name="pos1663"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   No, I am not married.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1664"><a name="pos1664"></a>MR PRIOR:   And where do you reside at present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1665"><a name="pos1665"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   I live in Randburg, Johannesburg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1666"><a name="pos1666"></a>MR PRIOR:   Thank you.  Will you please proceed with presenting </p>
<p class="line" id="line1667"><a name="pos1667"></a>your submissions to the Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1668"><a name="pos1668"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   Mr Chairman, I just want to go through the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1669"><a name="pos1669"></a>piece of my position and feelings regarding this amnesty application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1670"><a name="pos1670"></a>	From the 30th of December 1993, my life has never been the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1671"><a name="pos1671"></a>same for obvious reasons, being in a wheelchair, having lost the use </p>
<p class="line" id="line1672"><a name="pos1672"></a>of my legs due to the fact that I was shot in cold blood, at point </p>
<p class="line" id="line1673"><a name="pos1673"></a>blank range by the three applicants.  There is a lot a person can deal </p>
<p class="line" id="line1674"><a name="pos1674"></a>with and I thank God for the courage given to me and that got me </p>
<p class="line" id="line1675"><a name="pos1675"></a>where I am now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1676"><a name="pos1676"></a>	If it was not for that courage and strength and my optimism, I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1677"><a name="pos1677"></a>would not have been here today.  It is however, made very difficult </p>
<p class="line" id="line1678"><a name="pos1678"></a>when you have root nerve pain and various other forms of pain on a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1679"><a name="pos1679"></a>daily basis, pains that you can hardly explain to somebody, that I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1680"><a name="pos1680"></a>would never have had if this did not happen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1681"><a name="pos1681"></a>	I have lost a kidney and various parts of my intestines as well, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1682"><a name="pos1682"></a>as a result of the shooting.  This has been the reason and the cause </p>
<p class="line" id="line1683"><a name="pos1683"></a>why I initially ended up in hospital for several months and have </p>
<p class="line" id="line1684"><a name="pos1684"></a>subsequently been in hospital again a couple of times, because of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1685"><a name="pos1685"></a>various complications.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1686"><a name="pos1686"></a>	Nobody will ever know what it is like, what suffering a person </p>
<p class="line" id="line1687"><a name="pos1687"></a>has to go through until it has happened to you.  I would like to have </p>
<p class="line" id="line1688"><a name="pos1688"></a>each of the perpetrators look me in the eye and choose whether they </p>
<p class="line" id="line1689"><a name="pos1689"></a>would not mind having a rifle stuck in their spines and the trigger </p>
<p class="line" id="line1690"><a name="pos1690"></a>being pulled on them in cold blood, to leave them emotionally and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1691"><a name="pos1691"></a>physically scarred and disabled as I have been or would they rather </p>
<p class="line" id="line1692"><a name="pos1692"></a>stay in jail and serve their sentences for the crimes that they </p>
<p class="line" id="line1693"><a name="pos1693"></a>committed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1694"><a name="pos1694"></a>	There was a freedom fight in this country for many years </p>
<p class="line" id="line1695"><a name="pos1695"></a>before, our current President, Nelson Mandela was set free in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1696"><a name="pos1696"></a>early 1990's, in fact I think it was 1991.  He became President of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1697"><a name="pos1697"></a>this country due to the democratic elections that was held in April of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1698"><a name="pos1698"></a>1994, only four months after this horrific attack was launched on us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1699"><a name="pos1699"></a>	All political parties had by that time, come to agreement </p>
<p class="line" id="line1700"><a name="pos1700"></a>already that they are on the road to democracy in this country, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1701"><a name="pos1701"></a>including the perpetrators' party, including the PAC that had part in </p>
<p class="line" id="line1702"><a name="pos1702"></a>the interim constitution that was accepted on the 3rd of December </p>
<p class="line" id="line1703"><a name="pos1703"></a>1993, almost or just less than a month before this attack was still </p>
<p class="line" id="line1704"><a name="pos1704"></a>launched.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1705"><a name="pos1705"></a>	Why was this attack executed, given all these things?  The </p>
<p class="line" id="line1706"><a name="pos1706"></a>time period and the fact that we already embarked on a road to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1707"><a name="pos1707"></a>democracy?  It was years after everybody had already accepted, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1708"><a name="pos1708"></a>several years after it was accepted and realised that the freedom </p>
<p class="line" id="line1709"><a name="pos1709"></a>struggle was over and in my opinion, and I believe that this is the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1710"><a name="pos1710"></a>common belief under South Africans, this attack was launched in a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1711"><a name="pos1711"></a>period when the struggle was over, there was no reason for any </p>
<p class="line" id="line1712"><a name="pos1712"></a>group or fraction to prove a point, by launching such attacks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1713"><a name="pos1713"></a>	This was completely out of and after the supposed accepted </p>
<p class="line" id="line1714"><a name="pos1714"></a>time frame when such terrorist attacks was executed to prove a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1715"><a name="pos1715"></a>point as part of the struggle, but the struggle was already over.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1716"><a name="pos1716"></a>	This point was proved, and I can't understand why this attack </p>
<p class="line" id="line1717"><a name="pos1717"></a>was still sent through.  For this very reason, I am not prepared and I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1718"><a name="pos1718"></a>cannot find it in my heart, to forgive them at this point in time.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1719"><a name="pos1719"></a>therefore oppose this application for amnesty.  I do not believe that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1720"><a name="pos1720"></a>any murderers or criminals should be granted amnesty.  The </p>
<p class="line" id="line1721"><a name="pos1721"></a>murderers and criminals have been tried, convicted and sentenced by </p>
<p class="line" id="line1722"><a name="pos1722"></a>a Supreme Court in this country.  It proves to the ordinary person </p>
<p class="line" id="line1723"><a name="pos1723"></a>on the street and every other criminal, that it is just another one set </p>
<p class="line" id="line1724"><a name="pos1724"></a>free, or another three will be set free on our streets to roam as many </p>
<p class="line" id="line1725"><a name="pos1725"></a>other criminals in my belief, are still free on the streets.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1726"><a name="pos1726"></a>	The fact that the command was given by your higher </p>
<p class="line" id="line1727"><a name="pos1727"></a>authorities, still does not give any, and I repeat I want to stress that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1728"><a name="pos1728"></a>it does not give any person the right to go out and shoot young, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1729"><a name="pos1729"></a>innocent people that sat in a Tavern that night, that had no </p>
<p class="line" id="line1730"><a name="pos1730"></a>connection whatsoever with the Security Forces in this country.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1731"><a name="pos1731"></a>had no political affiliation to anybody, I was merely visiting a very </p>
<p class="line" id="line1732"><a name="pos1732"></a>good lady friend of mine that has been killed in this attack, Lindi </p>
<p class="line" id="line1733"><a name="pos1733"></a>Anne Fourie, and I cannot see in my heart, ever, that any person has </p>
<p class="line" id="line1734"><a name="pos1734"></a>got that right to walk in and take another person's life in cold blood </p>
<p class="line" id="line1735"><a name="pos1735"></a>when you don't even know who you are shooting at.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1736"><a name="pos1736"></a>	Lives have been taken and lives have been maimed because of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1737"><a name="pos1737"></a>these orders handed down.  There is in my opinion no reason </p>
<p class="line" id="line1738"><a name="pos1738"></a>whatsoever, to be such cowards, as to attack a pub full of cheerful </p>
<p class="line" id="line1739"><a name="pos1739"></a>young students in the middle of the most cosmopolitan area, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1740"><a name="pos1740"></a>Observatory, in Cape Town, on the eve of new year, whilst they are </p>
<p class="line" id="line1741"><a name="pos1741"></a>enjoying their youth together with youths of all other races, colours </p>
<p class="line" id="line1742"><a name="pos1742"></a>and creeds and all this whilst we were on our way to the first </p>
<p class="line" id="line1743"><a name="pos1743"></a>democratic elections in this country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1744"><a name="pos1744"></a>	I request of the perpetrators and their leaders, and I would </p>
<p class="line" id="line1745"><a name="pos1745"></a>like to echo what Mrs Fourie said, that was the higher command, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1746"><a name="pos1746"></a>higher parts in the PAC and I believe, I heard what you said Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line1747"><a name="pos1747"></a>Chairman, that it will be looked at further, and I do hope that it will </p>
<p class="line" id="line1748"><a name="pos1748"></a>be looked at further, but I request of them all, to explain to us why </p>
<p class="line" id="line1749"><a name="pos1749"></a>this was done, and if they have any logical reasoning for such a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1750"><a name="pos1750"></a>senseless attack at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1751"><a name="pos1751"></a>	Mr Chairman, I oppose this request for amnesty. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1752"><a name="pos1752"></a>	In conclusion, I just want to mention for the record, that I am </p>
<p class="line" id="line1753"><a name="pos1753"></a>not going into any detail whatsoever, as to my emotional suffering, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1754"><a name="pos1754"></a>physical pain, absolute distress and anger, fear I went through </p>
<p class="line" id="line1755"><a name="pos1755"></a>during those couple of months in hospital and the following years up </p>
<p class="line" id="line1756"><a name="pos1756"></a>to now, the absolute indescribable sacrifices and pain that my </p>
<p class="line" id="line1757"><a name="pos1757"></a>parents, my brother and my sister went through, pain and anger and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1758"><a name="pos1758"></a>fear that my family and friends experienced.  The humiliation of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1759"><a name="pos1759"></a>trying to adjust back into a very unforgiving society as an invalid, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1760"><a name="pos1760"></a>dependant on people for almost everything that you have to do, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1761"><a name="pos1761"></a>having to cope with the very unfriendly environment every day of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1762"><a name="pos1762"></a>your life.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1763"><a name="pos1763"></a>	Needless to say I could write, mention of write another 200 </p>
<p class="line" id="line1764"><a name="pos1764"></a>pages just on those few points, Mr Chairman, however, I have been </p>
<p class="line" id="line1765"><a name="pos1765"></a>able to cope in many respects and I will continue in my positive way </p>
<p class="line" id="line1766"><a name="pos1766"></a>as I believe I have been. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1767"><a name="pos1767"></a>	In conclusion to all of this, I am just interested in one thing, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1768"><a name="pos1768"></a>Mr Chairman, I want to see justice served.  That's all, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1769"><a name="pos1769"></a>MR PRIOR:   Do you confirm the statement and the information you </p>
<p class="line" id="line1770"><a name="pos1770"></a>have conveyed to the Committee, as part of your evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1771"><a name="pos1771"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1772"><a name="pos1772"></a>MR PRIOR:   Now, you have been in attendance throughout the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1773"><a name="pos1773"></a>proceedings from Monday, the 27th have you not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1774"><a name="pos1774"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1775"><a name="pos1775"></a>MR PRIOR:   And you've listened to the evidence of the applicants, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1776"><a name="pos1776"></a>as to how the attack occurred?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1777"><a name="pos1777"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1778"><a name="pos1778"></a>MR PRIOR:   I don't propose Mr Chairman, leading the witness </p>
<p class="line" id="line1779"><a name="pos1779"></a>through his summary on page 28, but are there any comments you </p>
<p class="line" id="line1780"><a name="pos1780"></a>would like to make about the incident, that differ materially from </p>
<p class="line" id="line1781"><a name="pos1781"></a>what you have heard presented thus far at the hearing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1782"><a name="pos1782"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   Mr Chairman, there is one point I would like - I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1783"><a name="pos1783"></a>have raised before and I would like to raise it again.  I think it was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1784"><a name="pos1784"></a>proved through the Police video and other evidence, that there must </p>
<p class="line" id="line1785"><a name="pos1785"></a>have been at least two shooters inside the Tavern and we have not </p>
<p class="line" id="line1786"><a name="pos1786"></a>been told for definite, if the second one was inside.  They have not </p>
<p class="line" id="line1787"><a name="pos1787"></a>disclosed that evidence and I believe and I would like to challenge </p>
<p class="line" id="line1788"><a name="pos1788"></a>them and say that there was two people inside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1789"><a name="pos1789"></a>	When I posed the question to Mabala I think, I asked him, or I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1790"><a name="pos1790"></a>think it was Madasi, I asked him where was Sibeko, the sixth </p>
<p class="line" id="line1791"><a name="pos1791"></a>person, he said he had forgotten.  In my opinion, he was inside and I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1792"><a name="pos1792"></a>would like them to comment on that again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1793"><a name="pos1793"></a>MR PRIOR:   Just another aspect, I think you mention it in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1794"><a name="pos1794"></a>question that you had when you asked the applicants questions.  The </p>
<p class="line" id="line1795"><a name="pos1795"></a>sounding of the shots, or how the shots sounded whilst you were in </p>
<p class="line" id="line1796"><a name="pos1796"></a>the Tavern.  Are you able to describe that for us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1797"><a name="pos1797"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   Mr Chairman, the shots were fired in lots of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1798"><a name="pos1798"></a>two, one and two and maybe three shots at a time, as if it was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1799"><a name="pos1799"></a>directed at people specifically at the time, the way a rifleman would </p>
<p class="line" id="line1800"><a name="pos1800"></a>be taught to shoot - in spurs of two shots at a time, and it was not </p>
<p class="line" id="line1801"><a name="pos1801"></a>automatic, random fire.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1802"><a name="pos1802"></a>MR PRIOR:   Is that your recollection?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1803"><a name="pos1803"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   That is my recollection.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1804"><a name="pos1804"></a>MR PRIOR:   Have you been able to compute or calculate the extent </p>
<p class="line" id="line1805"><a name="pos1805"></a>of your damages thus far?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1806"><a name="pos1806"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   I have made a submission of a claim to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1807"><a name="pos1807"></a>Truth and Reconciliation Commission in May of 1996, at the TRC </p>
<p class="line" id="line1808"><a name="pos1808"></a>offices in Johannesburg and at that time, it was in the region of and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1809"><a name="pos1809"></a>I stand corrected, but if I remember correctly the amount was in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1810"><a name="pos1810"></a>region of R1,2 million in terms of physical, actual things that you </p>
<p class="line" id="line1811"><a name="pos1811"></a>could count up and see and that obviously excludes any emotional </p>
<p class="line" id="line1812"><a name="pos1812"></a>pain and suffering, loss of income and things like that.  That was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1813"><a name="pos1813"></a>purely on medical expenses and future medical expenses etc.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1814"><a name="pos1814"></a>MR PRIOR:   Since the incident in 1993, have you received any </p>
<p class="line" id="line1815"><a name="pos1815"></a>assistance from the State in re-establishing or rehabilitating </p>
<p class="line" id="line1816"><a name="pos1816"></a>yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1817"><a name="pos1817"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   Up to this point, I have not received a cent from </p>
<p class="line" id="line1818"><a name="pos1818"></a>anybody.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1819"><a name="pos1819"></a>MR PRIOR:   You indicated to me before you gave evidence, that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1820"><a name="pos1820"></a>was some days ago, when we consulted, that you would request this </p>
<p class="line" id="line1821"><a name="pos1821"></a>Committee to refer your matter, your case to the Reparations </p>
<p class="line" id="line1822"><a name="pos1822"></a>Committee, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1823"><a name="pos1823"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1824"><a name="pos1824"></a>MR PRIOR:   Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1825"><a name="pos1825"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR PRIOR</p>
<p class="line" id="line1826"><a name="pos1826"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Arendse?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1827"><a name="pos1827"></a>CROSS-EXAMINATION BY ADV ARENDSE:	Mr Cornelius, you </p>
<p class="line" id="line1828"><a name="pos1828"></a>attended the hearings at court, the criminal court in 1994 which led </p>
<p class="line" id="line1829"><a name="pos1829"></a>to the conviction and sentence of the three applicants?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1830"><a name="pos1830"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1831"><a name="pos1831"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   And you gave evidence in that court?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1832"><a name="pos1832"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1833"><a name="pos1833"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   From the evidence and I am sure that on your </p>
<p class="line" id="line1834"><a name="pos1834"></a>own view, no one saw their faces so no one could identify these </p>
<p class="line" id="line1835"><a name="pos1835"></a>applicants?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1836"><a name="pos1836"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1837"><a name="pos1837"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Was there - and you know and it is also on </p>
<p class="line" id="line1838"><a name="pos1838"></a>record, that they were convicted on if I am wrong, the Committee or </p>
<p class="line" id="line1839"><a name="pos1839"></a>Mr Prior will correct me, there was a lot of technical evidence about </p>
<p class="line" id="line1840"><a name="pos1840"></a>their hair samples, the ballistics, the cap and things like that, in </p>
<p class="line" id="line1841"><a name="pos1841"></a>other words it was circumstantial as they call it, but technical </p>
<p class="line" id="line1842"><a name="pos1842"></a>evidence, nevertheless? </p>
<p class="line" id="line1843"><a name="pos1843"></a>	When you left that court after they were found guilty and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1844"><a name="pos1844"></a>sentenced, how did you feel about that?  How did you feel about </p>
<p class="line" id="line1845"><a name="pos1845"></a>them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1846"><a name="pos1846"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   I felt in the first place that due to the evidence </p>
<p class="line" id="line1847"><a name="pos1847"></a>that was there and they were convicted on that evidence, that it was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1848"><a name="pos1848"></a>the right thing to have happened, for them to be jailed or sentenced </p>
<p class="line" id="line1849"><a name="pos1849"></a>for crimes committed, so I felt that that was correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1850"><a name="pos1850"></a>	I also felt that it was - justice had been served, but I hadn't </p>
<p class="line" id="line1851"><a name="pos1851"></a>heard the entire truth.  I hadn't heard everything behind it, so I did </p>
<p class="line" id="line1852"><a name="pos1852"></a>have a feeling of emptiness and I must admit that through these </p>
<p class="line" id="line1853"><a name="pos1853"></a>proceedings, it has been a lot more evident to me and a lot more has </p>
<p class="line" id="line1854"><a name="pos1854"></a>come up, come out than what we knew after that court case and for </p>
<p class="line" id="line1855"><a name="pos1855"></a>that I am grateful.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1856"><a name="pos1856"></a>	I did feel, however, quite empty after that court case, as I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1857"><a name="pos1857"></a>haven't got out of it what I did now, after the court case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1858"><a name="pos1858"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   No, that is exactly, I think you have made the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1859"><a name="pos1859"></a>point.  You feel a lot better, that emptiness that you felt after the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1860"><a name="pos1860"></a>criminal trial, somehow whatever hole there was, has been filled </p>
<p class="line" id="line1861"><a name="pos1861"></a>through these proceedings, do you agree with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1862"><a name="pos1862"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   I would agree with that, but I would still want </p>
<p class="line" id="line1863"><a name="pos1863"></a>to see justice served.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1864"><a name="pos1864"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Now, you know these proceedings are held in </p>
<p class="line" id="line1865"><a name="pos1865"></a>terms of a law of Parliament and that law allows for amnesty to be </p>
<p class="line" id="line1866"><a name="pos1866"></a>granted even to these applicants, who committed the most heinous </p>
<p class="line" id="line1867"><a name="pos1867"></a>crime as long as they meet the requirements of the law, you accept </p>
<p class="line" id="line1868"><a name="pos1868"></a>that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1869"><a name="pos1869"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   I accept that that is what is stated in the law at </p>
<p class="line" id="line1870"><a name="pos1870"></a>the moment, however, I don't believe that they have met the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1871"><a name="pos1871"></a>requirements.  And if they haven't met the requirements, I still see </p>
<p class="line" id="line1872"><a name="pos1872"></a>that they should not be granted amnesty and should serve their </p>
<p class="line" id="line1873"><a name="pos1873"></a>sentence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1874"><a name="pos1874"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   I am just wanting to understand your opposition, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1875"><a name="pos1875"></a>or the basis of your opposition, that is why I am asking this </p>
<p class="line" id="line1876"><a name="pos1876"></a>question.  Justice was served and in fact, it has been confirmed, that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1877"><a name="pos1877"></a>they are the ones who participated and who committed this crime.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1878"><a name="pos1878"></a>	Now, we come to the amnesty process, which you will accept </p>
<p class="line" id="line1879"><a name="pos1879"></a>is different from that court process.  Now, is your opposition then </p>
<p class="line" id="line1880"><a name="pos1880"></a>not based on the fact that justice must be served, but that they didn't </p>
<p class="line" id="line1881"><a name="pos1881"></a>make, they haven't told us everything?  Is that why you are opposing </p>
<p class="line" id="line1882"><a name="pos1882"></a>this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1883"><a name="pos1883"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   I would, Mr Chairman, through you, there is </p>
<p class="line" id="line1884"><a name="pos1884"></a>two reasons why I oppose this, and the one is purely an emotional </p>
<p class="line" id="line1885"><a name="pos1885"></a>reason and it is probably not grounds, it is my personal reason, but I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1886"><a name="pos1886"></a>oppose this because I don't believe that they have told us everything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1887"><a name="pos1887"></a>	I don't believe that full disclosure have been given.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1888"><a name="pos1888"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   No, the first ground, I mean it is perfectly </p>
<p class="line" id="line1889"><a name="pos1889"></a>understandable, and I will be the first to say I am sure that if I were </p>
<p class="line" id="line1890"><a name="pos1890"></a>in your position, I would oppose it on that basis, too.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1891"><a name="pos1891"></a>	But let's deal with the disclosure aspect.  You have mentioned </p>
<p class="line" id="line1892"><a name="pos1892"></a>today that and this you say have been proved by the video evidence, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1893"><a name="pos1893"></a>that least two of the attackers were inside the Tavern.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1894"><a name="pos1894"></a>	That video was shown at the criminal trial.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1895"><a name="pos1895"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1896"><a name="pos1896"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   So you saw that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1897"><a name="pos1897"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   I was not allowed to see it.  As a witness and a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1898"><a name="pos1898"></a>victim in that court case, we were not allowed to actually be inside </p>
<p class="line" id="line1899"><a name="pos1899"></a>the court room before we had given our evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1900"><a name="pos1900"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Okay, fine.  So you also now saw the video for </p>
<p class="line" id="line1901"><a name="pos1901"></a>the first time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1902"><a name="pos1902"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   I only saw it for the first time now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1903"><a name="pos1903"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Now, you gave evidence nevertheless. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1904"><a name="pos1904"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1905"><a name="pos1905"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   And you also made a statement to the Police, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1906"><a name="pos1906"></a>now in your summary of your evidence which one finds on page 44 </p>
<p class="line" id="line1907"><a name="pos1907"></a>from line 21 onwards, and I will just read it to you Mr Cornelius, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1908"><a name="pos1908"></a>line 19.  Two of the women, Bernadette Langford and Lindi Anne </p>
<p class="line" id="line1909"><a name="pos1909"></a>Fourie were flat mates of David Deglon.  They were with him and a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1910"><a name="pos1910"></a>friend Quentin Cornelius, a friend from Johannesburg.  They sat at </p>
<p class="line" id="line1911"><a name="pos1911"></a>one of the tables at a raised platform area in the Tavern.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1912"><a name="pos1912"></a>	This table, probably because it was diagonally across from the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1913"><a name="pos1913"></a>opening of the door and fairly visible, suffered the worst under the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1914"><a name="pos1914"></a>attack.  Not only the deceased Bernadette Langford and Lindi Anne </p>
<p class="line" id="line1915"><a name="pos1915"></a>Fourie were killed here, but David Deglon and Quentin Cornelius </p>
<p class="line" id="line1916"><a name="pos1916"></a>were also seriously injured.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1917"><a name="pos1917"></a>	Roland Palm were also sitting at one of the tables on the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1918"><a name="pos1918"></a>platform when the attack started.  Is that summary reasonably </p>
<p class="line" id="line1919"><a name="pos1919"></a>accurate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1920"><a name="pos1920"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   That is accurate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1921"><a name="pos1921"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Now, I am actually just looking for the part </p>
<p class="line" id="line1922"><a name="pos1922"></a>where, sorry on page 47 Mr Chairman, at line 20, because you will </p>
<p class="line" id="line1923"><a name="pos1923"></a>recall that the applicants were also charged with attempting to kill </p>
<p class="line" id="line1924"><a name="pos1924"></a>you, attempting to murder you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1925"><a name="pos1925"></a>	Quentin Cornelius, as we have already seen, was a visitor to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1926"><a name="pos1926"></a>Cape Town.  He was in the company of Lindi Anne Fourie, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1927"><a name="pos1927"></a>Bernadette Langford and David Deglon.  He sat at the same table on </p>
<p class="line" id="line1928"><a name="pos1928"></a>the platform.  He suddenly heard a pop sound and immediately knew </p>
<p class="line" id="line1929"><a name="pos1929"></a>that this was rifle fire although he did not see anyone firing.  He </p>
<p class="line" id="line1930"><a name="pos1930"></a>dived towards the left, but while diving, he was hit by one of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1931"><a name="pos1931"></a>projectiles which flung him two metres further onto the ground.  He </p>
<p class="line" id="line1932"><a name="pos1932"></a>realised that his lower body was lame and pulled himself by his arms, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1933"><a name="pos1933"></a>under one of the tables to hide.  There was pandemonium in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1934"><a name="pos1934"></a>Tavern.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1935"><a name="pos1935"></a>	My question to you Mr Cornelius is, why are you only saying </p>
<p class="line" id="line1936"><a name="pos1936"></a>that there were two of these killers inside the Tavern because you </p>
<p class="line" id="line1937"><a name="pos1937"></a>saw the video evidence?  Is that the only reason why you are now </p>
<p class="line" id="line1938"><a name="pos1938"></a>saying - because may I just add before you answer, that in your </p>
<p class="line" id="line1939"><a name="pos1939"></a>statement to the Police which I had Mr Chairman, but somehow I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1940"><a name="pos1940"></a>can't get hold of it, I don't know if Mr Prior's got a copy, you don't </p>
<p class="line" id="line1941"><a name="pos1941"></a>say there either that anyone was inside the Tavern?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1942"><a name="pos1942"></a>	Why are you  now insisting that there were two people inside </p>
<p class="line" id="line1943"><a name="pos1943"></a>the Tavern and also before you answer, in your own prepared </p>
<p class="line" id="line1944"><a name="pos1944"></a>statement which is in front of us, on page 28, you also say that you </p>
<p class="line" id="line1945"><a name="pos1945"></a>believe that there were five gunmen firing automatic rifles at random </p>
<p class="line" id="line1946"><a name="pos1946"></a>at the patrons inside the Pub.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1947"><a name="pos1947"></a>	I've got the statement now in front of me, Mr Chairman, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1948"><a name="pos1948"></a>maybe I should just read this bit.  It is paragraph 3 and it is in </p>
<p class="line" id="line1949"><a name="pos1949"></a>Afrikaans.  Roughly at midnight I heard shots, I jumped up.  My </p>
<p class="line" id="line1950"><a name="pos1950"></a>back was turned towards the attackers and at that moment, I was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1951"><a name="pos1951"></a>injured in the back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1952"><a name="pos1952"></a>	"There were numerous shots fired, but these were single shots </p>
<p class="line" id="line1953"><a name="pos1953"></a>and not automatic fire".  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1954"><a name="pos1954"></a>That is what you said in your statement.  The date is unclear because </p>
<p class="line" id="line1955"><a name="pos1955"></a>of the photocopy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1956"><a name="pos1956"></a>MR PRIOR:   Mr Chairman, the original is available, it is dated the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1957"><a name="pos1957"></a>5th of January 1994.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1958"><a name="pos1958"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Shouldn't you read the next paragraph as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1959"><a name="pos1959"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   The next paragraph says I subsequently fell to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1960"><a name="pos1960"></a>the floor and dragged myself away underneath one of the tables.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1961"><a name="pos1961"></a>did not see the attackers and do not know how many attackers there </p>
<p class="line" id="line1962"><a name="pos1962"></a>might have been.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1963"><a name="pos1963"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   My response to that is I did not know how many </p>
<p class="line" id="line1964"><a name="pos1964"></a>people there were exactly.  As I said in this statement as well, there </p>
<p class="line" id="line1965"><a name="pos1965"></a>was a lot of shots fired, but I can distinctly remember and I never </p>
<p class="line" id="line1966"><a name="pos1966"></a>lost consciousness throughout this, I do remember single shots as if </p>
<p class="line" id="line1967"><a name="pos1967"></a>one and two at a time, and not automatic fire. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1968"><a name="pos1968"></a>	The reason why I say there were two gunmen inside is I heard </p>
<p class="line" id="line1969"><a name="pos1969"></a>and it was at a very, very close range, when you have a gunshot on </p>
<p class="line" id="line1970"><a name="pos1970"></a>this side and a gunshot on this side, from behind you, you can </p>
<p class="line" id="line1971"><a name="pos1971"></a>distinctly understand or remember that it is two separate rifles and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1972"><a name="pos1972"></a>although I didn't see them, it is my belief that there were two </p>
<p class="line" id="line1973"><a name="pos1973"></a>gunmen inside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1974"><a name="pos1974"></a>	And because of other evidence after the time as well, like the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1975"><a name="pos1975"></a>amount of spent cartridges found inside the Pub, is it to me obvious </p>
<p class="line" id="line1976"><a name="pos1976"></a>that there must have been two.  I distinctly remember the gunfire of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1977"><a name="pos1977"></a>two separate rifles from inside the Tavern.  I also heard gunfire </p>
<p class="line" id="line1978"><a name="pos1978"></a>outside, but you could hear the difference between inside and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1979"><a name="pos1979"></a>outside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1980"><a name="pos1980"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Mr Cornelius, unfortunately I've got to take </p>
<p class="line" id="line1981"><a name="pos1981"></a>issue with you on that.  Firstly, I can understand why you said in </p>
<p class="line" id="line1982"><a name="pos1982"></a>your statement and at court, why firstly you never saw any of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1983"><a name="pos1983"></a>attackers and also why you couldn't say how many of them were </p>
<p class="line" id="line1984"><a name="pos1984"></a>inside or anywhere at the Tavern.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1985"><a name="pos1985"></a>	And I also want to suggest to you, and I think you've partially </p>
<p class="line" id="line1986"><a name="pos1986"></a>answered that question, that whatever view or suspicion you might </p>
<p class="line" id="line1987"><a name="pos1987"></a>have had as some are being influenced by what you saw on the video </p>
<p class="line" id="line1988"><a name="pos1988"></a>camera, when you saw the video here.  Would it be fair to say that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1989"><a name="pos1989"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   It could be fair to say that, I was obviously </p>
<p class="line" id="line1990"><a name="pos1990"></a>influenced by that, but I would like to say again that and I am </p>
<p class="line" id="line1991"><a name="pos1991"></a>tempted to use this as the applicants did as well, I was there and I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1992"><a name="pos1992"></a>really did hear gunfire from separate rifles inside the Tavern and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1993"><a name="pos1993"></a>they were single shots fired and not automatic fire at that time.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1994"><a name="pos1994"></a>might have been influenced later on by the video as well as by the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1995"><a name="pos1995"></a>Police records and evidence and the amount of cartridges found </p>
<p class="line" id="line1996"><a name="pos1996"></a>inside, but it just confirmed my suspicions and my belief.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1997"><a name="pos1997"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Now, Mr Cornelius, on my reading of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1998"><a name="pos1998"></a>summary that is contained in the Judge's judgement, apart from a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1999"><a name="pos1999"></a>Ciska du Plessis, who also happens to be a Captain in the South </p>
<p class="line" id="line2000"><a name="pos2000"></a>African Police, apart from her alleging that she saw two men come </p>
<p class="line" id="line2001"><a name="pos2001"></a>through the front door, no one else had mentioned anything about </p>
<p class="line" id="line2002"><a name="pos2002"></a>any gunmen, any of the attackers being inside the Tavern.  Do you </p>
<p class="line" id="line2003"><a name="pos2003"></a>remember that?  You were there during the whole of the trial?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2004"><a name="pos2004"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   Yes.  I was however, not inside.  What I hear </p>
<p class="line" id="line2005"><a name="pos2005"></a>from you now, is from the records, because we were only allowed </p>
<p class="line" id="line2006"><a name="pos2006"></a>into the court when I gave my evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2007"><a name="pos2007"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Yes, of course.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2008"><a name="pos2008"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   So I wasn't actually in the trial.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2009"><a name="pos2009"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Okay, I am sorry then.  Yes, that would be right. </p>
<p class="line" id="line2010"><a name="pos2010"></a> Whoever then came after you, I don't know in which order </p>
<p class="line" id="line2011"><a name="pos2011"></a>witnesses came.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2012"><a name="pos2012"></a>	It also seems to me from reading of the evidence, and I just </p>
<p class="line" id="line2013"><a name="pos2013"></a>want to put this to you, I don't want to have a fight with you, that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2014"><a name="pos2014"></a>there were what is referred to in Afrikaans as two volleys and I am </p>
<p class="line" id="line2015"><a name="pos2015"></a>reading from the evidence or the summary of Mr Gary Donovan </p>
<p class="line" id="line2016"><a name="pos2016"></a>Atkinson who was the owner of the Tavern at the time, and it is on </p>
<p class="line" id="line2017"><a name="pos2017"></a>page 43 from lines 8 onwards, Mr Chairman.  He says, he is the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2018"><a name="pos2018"></a>owner, and then he goes on to say that at about ten to twelve that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2019"><a name="pos2019"></a>evening, I heard a loud popping noise, followed by gunfire which he </p>
<p class="line" id="line2020"><a name="pos2020"></a>thought was rapid fire.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2021"><a name="pos2021"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   Sorry, was that ten to eleven or ten to twelve?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2022"><a name="pos2022"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Sorry, did I say ten to eleven, it is ten to twelve, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2023"><a name="pos2023"></a>sorry.  Followed by gunfire which he thought  was rapid fire.  He </p>
<p class="line" id="line2024"><a name="pos2024"></a>took cover and shouted at the other persons in the Tavern to fall </p>
<p class="line" id="line2025"><a name="pos2025"></a>down.  This firing continued for a brief while and it was then paused </p>
<p class="line" id="line2026"><a name="pos2026"></a>as though the attackers had departed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2027"><a name="pos2027"></a>	He stood up to approach the telephone and at that moment, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2028"><a name="pos2028"></a>the fire resumed.  He again shouted at the roughly  50 patrons, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2029"><a name="pos2029"></a>mostly in the central part of the bar, to fall down.  This second </p>
<p class="line" id="line2030"><a name="pos2030"></a>series of firing lasted longer than the first.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2031"><a name="pos2031"></a>	So it seems to me, what is the English word, I forget now ... </p>
<p class="line" id="line2032"><a name="pos2032"></a>(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line2033"><a name="pos2033"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   Two sessions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2034"><a name="pos2034"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Two bouts of firing, two separate occasions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2035"><a name="pos2035"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Yes, bursts.  I think bursts is probably the better </p>
<p class="line" id="line2036"><a name="pos2036"></a>word.  There were two bursts of gunfire, it seems to suggest that, I </p>
<p class="line" id="line2037"><a name="pos2037"></a>don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2038"><a name="pos2038"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   I would agree with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2039"><a name="pos2039"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   I think Mr Arendse, the only real difference is </p>
<p class="line" id="line2040"><a name="pos2040"></a>that he is drawing an inference, he doesn't say he saw two people, he </p>
<p class="line" id="line2041"><a name="pos2041"></a>is drawing an inference from the fact that he heard firing from two </p>
<p class="line" id="line2042"><a name="pos2042"></a>sides and that evidence was not given and was not asked in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2043"><a name="pos2043"></a>court, at the trial.  Can you take it any further?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2044"><a name="pos2044"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Okay, thanks.  No, in fact Mr Cornelius, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2045"><a name="pos2045"></a>evidence here of the applicants is in fact that Mr Madasi who is </p>
<p class="line" id="line2046"><a name="pos2046"></a>sitting nearest to you with the white top, came inside the Tavern </p>
<p class="line" id="line2047"><a name="pos2047"></a>through the side door and sort of partially hiding behind the wall </p>
<p class="line" id="line2048"><a name="pos2048"></a>there, was firing at you and I think that is what the Judge meant that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2049"><a name="pos2049"></a>you, on the raised platform were immediately closest to him and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2050"><a name="pos2050"></a>visible, and he fired and at the same time, the evidence of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2051"><a name="pos2051"></a>applicants is that Gqomfa was on the far right, and Mabala in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2052"><a name="pos2052"></a>middle, sorry not Mabala, someone else who is now not here, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2053"><a name="pos2053"></a>Jantjie, were firing from outside the Tavern through the double </p>
<p class="line" id="line2054"><a name="pos2054"></a>doors and through the windows.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2055"><a name="pos2055"></a>	Would that correspond with what you felt was happening that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2056"><a name="pos2056"></a>night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2057"><a name="pos2057"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   I can't say that that is any different from what </p>
<p class="line" id="line2058"><a name="pos2058"></a>might have happened, it sounds correct to me.  There were gunfire </p>
<p class="line" id="line2059"><a name="pos2059"></a>through the windows as well, and outside in the street, but I heard </p>
<p class="line" id="line2060"><a name="pos2060"></a>gunfire inside the Tavern.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2061"><a name="pos2061"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Now, we've also heard from Mr Cerqueira, I </p>
<p class="line" id="line2062"><a name="pos2062"></a>think I've got his pronunciation right, Mr Cerqueira who appeared to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2063"><a name="pos2063"></a>know a bit about guns.  He also, when I asked him what he heard, he </p>
<p class="line" id="line2064"><a name="pos2064"></a>spoke about I think, I speak under correction, rapid gunfire which I </p>
<p class="line" id="line2065"><a name="pos2065"></a>asked him like automatic fire?  Would you not disagree with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2066"><a name="pos2066"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   I can't say if others were on automatic fire </p>
<p class="line" id="line2067"><a name="pos2067"></a>outside or wherever they were, if there is five or six or four rifles </p>
<p class="line" id="line2068"><a name="pos2068"></a>for that matter, firing at the same time, two shots at a time, it will </p>
<p class="line" id="line2069"><a name="pos2069"></a>most certainly sound like automatic gunfire.  But I for definite heard </p>
<p class="line" id="line2070"><a name="pos2070"></a>single shots fired at the time, and not on automatic fire.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2071"><a name="pos2071"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Well, just for the record, we put that in issue Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line2072"><a name="pos2072"></a>Cornelius, because that is my concern as the representative for the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2073"><a name="pos2073"></a>applicants.  You must correct me if I am wrong, but the impression </p>
<p class="line" id="line2074"><a name="pos2074"></a>that you want to create is that they, two of them came inside the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2075"><a name="pos2075"></a>Tavern, and not only randomly and indiscriminately, they actually </p>
<p class="line" id="line2076"><a name="pos2076"></a>aimed at you and they aimed at some of the deceased.  Is that the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2077"><a name="pos2077"></a>impression that you are creating?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2078"><a name="pos2078"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   That is the impression not that I want to create, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2079"><a name="pos2079"></a>that is the impression that I have.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2080"><a name="pos2080"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   I want to put it to you that that impression is a </p>
<p class="line" id="line2081"><a name="pos2081"></a>wrong impression, it is not supported by the facts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2082"><a name="pos2082"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   I don't agree.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2083"><a name="pos2083"></a>MR PRIOR:   I think that is incorrect, with respect, and I must </p>
<p class="line" id="line2084"><a name="pos2084"></a>object.  Exhibit A has gone in, there has been evidence about Exhibit </p>
<p class="line" id="line2085"><a name="pos2085"></a>A, and if we look at the photograph at page 2(b), the cartridge that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2086"><a name="pos2086"></a>is against the wall, between the two deceased on the raised platform, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2087"><a name="pos2087"></a>has never been explained and certainly would seem to suggest on the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2088"><a name="pos2088"></a>inferences, that that was ejected from a rifle very close to that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2089"><a name="pos2089"></a>position.  Certainly not anywhere near the door.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2090"><a name="pos2090"></a>	So, my objection is simply that to say that it is not being </p>
<p class="line" id="line2091"><a name="pos2091"></a>substantiated by anything, is misleading.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2092"><a name="pos2092"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   There may be some merits in your objection if </p>
<p class="line" id="line2093"><a name="pos2093"></a>we had any evidence about it.  Don't you think we should have some </p>
<p class="line" id="line2094"><a name="pos2094"></a>evidence Mr Prior, from someone who is an expert in R4 rifles to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2095"><a name="pos2095"></a>tell us where the cartridges are discharged, how far away they can </p>
<p class="line" id="line2096"><a name="pos2096"></a>be thrown. </p>
<p class="line" id="line2097"><a name="pos2097"></a>	It may well be that the evidence will be that they are </p>
<p class="line" id="line2098"><a name="pos2098"></a>discharged to the right, so someone standing where this young </p>
<p class="line" id="line2099"><a name="pos2099"></a>gentleman said he was standing at the gap in the wall, cartridges </p>
<p class="line" id="line2100"><a name="pos2100"></a>from his rifle could never have gone anywhere near the raised </p>
<p class="line" id="line2101"><a name="pos2101"></a>platform.  But we haven't got that evidence before us at the moment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2102"><a name="pos2102"></a>	This question about where cartridges go to, is we all have to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2103"><a name="pos2103"></a>rely back to the time we last used a rifle and try to remember.  And I </p>
<p class="line" id="line2104"><a name="pos2104"></a>think it would help because, can I while we are on this, and I am </p>
<p class="line" id="line2105"><a name="pos2105"></a>interrupting you Mr Arendse, I don't want you to look at the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2106"><a name="pos2106"></a>photographs - I think that they are, I would rather you don't look at </p>
<p class="line" id="line2107"><a name="pos2107"></a>the moment, but can you look at that plan, it is Exhibit B.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2108"><a name="pos2108"></a>	Can you indicate to us approximately where it was that you </p>
<p class="line" id="line2109"><a name="pos2109"></a>were sitting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2110"><a name="pos2110"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   The closest I can explain, if you can see the "d".</p>
<p class="line" id="line2111"><a name="pos2111"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   "d"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2112"><a name="pos2112"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   The "d" is pointing to a raised platform and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2113"><a name="pos2113"></a>there, what seems to be tables.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2114"><a name="pos2114"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   In fact, Exhibit D is where one of the bodies </p>
<p class="line" id="line2115"><a name="pos2115"></a>was found.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2116"><a name="pos2116"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, because it was on that platform, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2117"><a name="pos2117"></a>second table into the shop.  There was one other table that was </p>
<p class="line" id="line2118"><a name="pos2118"></a>slightly below us and right behind us, and that was the table that Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line2119"><a name="pos2119"></a>Palm and his daughter sat at.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2120"><a name="pos2120"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   And you were the second table on that raised </p>
<p class="line" id="line2121"><a name="pos2121"></a>platform?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2122"><a name="pos2122"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   We were the second, on that raised platform.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2123"><a name="pos2123"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   I think we all know what you mean by the raised </p>
<p class="line" id="line2124"><a name="pos2124"></a>platform, that is on the right of the plan, marked off by a double </p>
<p class="line" id="line2125"><a name="pos2125"></a>line.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2126"><a name="pos2126"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2127"><a name="pos2127"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   And you were approximately somewhere near </p>
<p class="line" id="line2128"><a name="pos2128"></a>where the "d" would have been?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2129"><a name="pos2129"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   More or less there, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2130"><a name="pos2130"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Where the, sorry not where the "d" is, but where </p>
<p class="line" id="line2131"><a name="pos2131"></a>the line from the "d" ends, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2132"><a name="pos2132"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Just on the other aspect, with respect, Judge </p>
<p class="line" id="line2133"><a name="pos2133"></a>Wilson is correct is that all we have up to now before and which is </p>
<p class="line" id="line2134"><a name="pos2134"></a>not in dispute and then Mr Prior is correct, is that these cartridges </p>
<p class="line" id="line2135"><a name="pos2135"></a>were found close to or next to, on top of the deceased bodies.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2136"><a name="pos2136"></a>There is no evidence, the only evidence is that from the applicant's </p>
<p class="line" id="line2137"><a name="pos2137"></a>side is Madasi was standing, sorry maybe I could just deal with this </p>
<p class="line" id="line2138"><a name="pos2138"></a>Mr Cornelius, you were at the end of that line which comes from </p>
<p class="line" id="line2139"><a name="pos2139"></a>"d", is that right, more or less there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2140"><a name="pos2140"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   Where I was lying after the attack or before?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2141"><a name="pos2141"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   No, where you were sitting and chatting and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2142"><a name="pos2142"></a>having a drink?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2143"><a name="pos2143"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   I was sitting, correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2144"><a name="pos2144"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Yes, now how far is that from the corner of that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2145"><a name="pos2145"></a>wall?  Or rather, let me put it this way, you see "h" there, "h" is an </p>
<p class="line" id="line2146"><a name="pos2146"></a>entrance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2147"><a name="pos2147"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2148"><a name="pos2148"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Okay, now if Madasi says that he went down that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2149"><a name="pos2149"></a>entrance and there is a wall there on his right as you go down, is </p>
<p class="line" id="line2150"><a name="pos2150"></a>that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2151"><a name="pos2151"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2152"><a name="pos2152"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   What we've got at the moment is a little bit of a </p>
<p class="line" id="line2153"><a name="pos2153"></a>wall and a wide open space and then another little bit of wall, should </p>
<p class="line" id="line2154"><a name="pos2154"></a>that all be wall on the right?  That is to about the level  of "b", that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2155"><a name="pos2155"></a>is all wall and then there is an opening, and that is what we see in </p>
<p class="line" id="line2156"><a name="pos2156"></a>the photographs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2157"><a name="pos2157"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Thank you Judge.  Is that opening directly </p>
<p class="line" id="line2158"><a name="pos2158"></a>opposite where you were sitting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2159"><a name="pos2159"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   I would say it was diagonally opposite.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2160"><a name="pos2160"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Diagonally, okay.  And how far would that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2161"><a name="pos2161"></a>opening be from you, four, five metres?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2162"><a name="pos2162"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   At least, at least five metres.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2163"><a name="pos2163"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Okay, because I want to put it to you or just for </p>
<p class="line" id="line2164"><a name="pos2164"></a>your comment, my information is, and maybe we will test this with </p>
<p class="line" id="line2165"><a name="pos2165"></a>whoever is going to be called to give us maybe some expert evidence </p>
<p class="line" id="line2166"><a name="pos2166"></a>on where, how these cartridges land up there, is that when you are a </p>
<p class="line" id="line2167"><a name="pos2167"></a>position of four to five, or even six metres away and you are firing </p>
<p class="line" id="line2168"><a name="pos2168"></a>like Mr Madasi was firing with an R4 rifle, then it is quite possible, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2169"><a name="pos2169"></a>and in fact it would happen that these cartridges could land some </p>
<p class="line" id="line2170"><a name="pos2170"></a>four to six metres away from where you fire.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2171"><a name="pos2171"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   I do not believe that that is possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2172"><a name="pos2172"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Okay, fine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2173"><a name="pos2173"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   I do not believe that you can stand behind a </p>
<p class="line" id="line2174"><a name="pos2174"></a>wall, as he says, and supposedly as we all know, cartridges shoot </p>
<p class="line" id="line2175"><a name="pos2175"></a>out to the right if we want to use that, if he is behind a wall, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2176"><a name="pos2176"></a>shooting at people in that direction where the wall that he took as </p>
<p class="line" id="line2177"><a name="pos2177"></a>cover here, his cartridges should land against the wall, towards, and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2178"><a name="pos2178"></a>not four or five or six metres, between the heads of two people lying </p>
<p class="line" id="line2179"><a name="pos2179"></a>on the raised platform.  I do not believe that it could go that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2180"><a name="pos2180"></a>distance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2181"><a name="pos2181"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   There is just something which momentously </p>
<p class="line" id="line2182"><a name="pos2182"></a>slipped me Mr Chairman, I am just trying to think what it was.  It is </p>
<p class="line" id="line2183"><a name="pos2183"></a>this Mr Cornelius, and perhaps this is for the record Mr Chairman, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2184"><a name="pos2184"></a>but obviously Mr Cornelius can comment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2185"><a name="pos2185"></a>	Before a criminal trail starts Mr Cornelius, the State </p>
<p class="line" id="line2186"><a name="pos2186"></a>Prosecutor, the State Advocate would give a summary of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2187"><a name="pos2187"></a>evidence that he intends to lead at a criminal trial.  He gives it to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2188"><a name="pos2188"></a>the other Advocates.  Now I have that summary in front of me and I </p>
<p class="line" id="line2189"><a name="pos2189"></a>want to read it to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2190"><a name="pos2190"></a>	I can obviously make it available if it needs to be.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2191"><a name="pos2191"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   What purpose does that serve, the summary?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2192"><a name="pos2192"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   The only purpose it serves is that it doesn't </p>
<p class="line" id="line2193"><a name="pos2193"></a>mention anything, Mr Cornelius, about these gunmen, these </p>
<p class="line" id="line2194"><a name="pos2194"></a>attackers having gone inside the Tavern.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2195"><a name="pos2195"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   That is not evidence in any case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2196"><a name="pos2196"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   No, no, but we've had, Mr Chairman, with </p>
<p class="line" id="line2197"><a name="pos2197"></a>respect, we've had statements which is not evidence, photographs </p>
<p class="line" id="line2198"><a name="pos2198"></a>which is also not evidence being put to witnesses.  I am putting it to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2199"><a name="pos2199"></a>him for his comment, to be fair, he can tell me whether he agrees </p>
<p class="line" id="line2200"><a name="pos2200"></a>with it or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2201"><a name="pos2201"></a>ADV SANDI:   Sorry, Mr Arendse, is it not because that is just a </p>
<p class="line" id="line2202"><a name="pos2202"></a>summary of facts as the basis on which the State will found its case </p>
<p class="line" id="line2203"><a name="pos2203"></a>and doesn't necessarily have to state everything?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2204"><a name="pos2204"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Well exactly, the point is one would have </p>
<p class="line" id="line2205"><a name="pos2205"></a>thought that the summariser will presumably ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line2206"><a name="pos2206"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   (Indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line2207"><a name="pos2207"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   I don't want to take that any further.  The point </p>
<p class="line" id="line2208"><a name="pos2208"></a>is just, and it is maybe something more appropriately raised in </p>
<p class="line" id="line2209"><a name="pos2209"></a>argument.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2210"><a name="pos2210"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   We know there were 48 cartridge cases </p>
<p class="line" id="line2211"><a name="pos2211"></a>scattered around inside the Tavern.  There must have been people </p>
<p class="line" id="line2212"><a name="pos2212"></a>inside there, mustn't there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2213"><a name="pos2213"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Well, the applicant, one of the applicants </p>
<p class="line" id="line2214"><a name="pos2214"></a>Madasi, says he was inside there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2215"><a name="pos2215"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2216"><a name="pos2216"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2217"><a name="pos2217"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Well, the fact that it is not in some summary </p>
<p class="line" id="line2218"><a name="pos2218"></a>shows that the Prosecutor forgot to say it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2219"><a name="pos2219"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Well, he also then forgot to say that there were </p>
<p class="line" id="line2220"><a name="pos2220"></a>two or five or two or more attackers inside the Tavern.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2221"><a name="pos2221"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I don't think we can take that matter further </p>
<p class="line" id="line2222"><a name="pos2222"></a>as to what the Prosecutor said in his statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2223"><a name="pos2223"></a>	Mr Cornelius, lastly, I want to ask you these applicants have </p>
<p class="line" id="line2224"><a name="pos2224"></a>come before the Committee, you've heard them, you've been sitting </p>
<p class="line" id="line2225"><a name="pos2225"></a>here all the time, you've heard them say that they are responsible for </p>
<p class="line" id="line2226"><a name="pos2226"></a>what happened.  They attacked the Tavern on orders, they killed the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2227"><a name="pos2227"></a>deceased, they injured you.  Is there any reason that you can think </p>
<p class="line" id="line2228"><a name="pos2228"></a>of why they wouldn't want to say or except for the applicant Madasi, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2229"><a name="pos2229"></a>is there any reason that you can think of why Mabala and Gqomfa </p>
<p class="line" id="line2230"><a name="pos2230"></a>would deny or wouldn't say that they were inside the Tavern?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2231"><a name="pos2231"></a>	They have been found guilty, they have been sentenced, you </p>
<p class="line" id="line2232"><a name="pos2232"></a>know that.  They are in jail for 27 years, they are here at the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2233"><a name="pos2233"></a>amnesty, this is the only, it is not the last opportunity, it is their </p>
<p class="line" id="line2234"><a name="pos2234"></a>only opportunity to get out of jail.  Is there any reason that you can </p>
<p class="line" id="line2235"><a name="pos2235"></a>think of why they wouldn't want to make full disclosure including </p>
<p class="line" id="line2236"><a name="pos2236"></a>saying but we were inside the Tavern, we shot and killed these </p>
<p class="line" id="line2237"><a name="pos2237"></a>people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2238"><a name="pos2238"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   I do not see any reason why Gqomfa or Mabala </p>
<p class="line" id="line2239"><a name="pos2239"></a>should hide it, but why don't they tell us where the sixth person </p>
<p class="line" id="line2240"><a name="pos2240"></a>was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2241"><a name="pos2241"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Thank you Mr Cornelius, I've got no further </p>
<p class="line" id="line2242"><a name="pos2242"></a>questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2243"><a name="pos2243"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY ADV ARENDSE</p>
<p class="line" id="line2244"><a name="pos2244"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Any re-examination Mr Prior?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2245"><a name="pos2245"></a>RE-EXAMINATION BY MR PRIOR:	Thank you.  You indicated </p>
<p class="line" id="line2246"><a name="pos2246"></a>where you were seated and where some of the deceased were seated, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2247"><a name="pos2247"></a>your companions.  And you were asked a short while ago can you </p>
<p class="line" id="line2248"><a name="pos2248"></a>think of any reason why they wouldn't make full disclosure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2249"><a name="pos2249"></a>	There has been evidence led and it has been suggested that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2250"><a name="pos2250"></a>this was a Bar or a Tavern frequented by military personnel.  As far </p>
<p class="line" id="line2251"><a name="pos2251"></a>as you were aware on that evening, were there anyone that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2252"><a name="pos2252"></a>resembled military personnel in uniforms or the like?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2253"><a name="pos2253"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   As far as I can remember, not one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2254"><a name="pos2254"></a>MR PRIOR:   How were the people dressed on that occasion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2255"><a name="pos2255"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   It was as if we were holiday makers, which I </p>
<p class="line" id="line2256"><a name="pos2256"></a>was at the time, dressed in shorts, T-shirts, sandals, caps on, leisure </p>
<p class="line" id="line2257"><a name="pos2257"></a>wear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2258"><a name="pos2258"></a>MR PRIOR:   And if someone, we heard from I think Mr Madasi, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2259"><a name="pos2259"></a>who indicated that the lighting, there was sufficient lighting to see </p>
<p class="line" id="line2260"><a name="pos2260"></a>people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2261"><a name="pos2261"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   There was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2262"><a name="pos2262"></a>MR PRIOR:   A person could see clearly who was enjoying </p>
<p class="line" id="line2263"><a name="pos2263"></a>themselves in the Tavern?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2264"><a name="pos2264"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2265"><a name="pos2265"></a>MR PRIOR:   Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2266"><a name="pos2266"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR PRIOR</p>
<p class="line" id="line2267"><a name="pos2267"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Had you been there before?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2268"><a name="pos2268"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   No, Judge.  That was the first time I had been </p>
<p class="line" id="line2269"><a name="pos2269"></a>there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2270"><a name="pos2270"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   And what door did you use to get in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2271"><a name="pos2271"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   On the sketch it is marked by "h".</p>
<p class="line" id="line2272"><a name="pos2272"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Now, the door that is marked "g" on this sketch, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2273"><a name="pos2273"></a>I don't know if you remember it, it is a double door with glass, was </p>
<p class="line" id="line2274"><a name="pos2274"></a>that door open?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2275"><a name="pos2275"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   No.  It was locked and bolted from the inside.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2276"><a name="pos2276"></a>And I specifically remember even looking at it, it seemed to be just a </p>
<p class="line" id="line2277"><a name="pos2277"></a>feature, it hadn't been opened for years.  That is certainly the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2278"><a name="pos2278"></a>impression I had when I arrived because it is the first time I had </p>
<p class="line" id="line2279"><a name="pos2279"></a>been there, and I looked at the place.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2280"><a name="pos2280"></a>	It was as if that was an old door, never used, and locked just </p>
<p class="line" id="line2281"><a name="pos2281"></a>as a feature, it was completely painted closed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2282"><a name="pos2282"></a>ADV SANDI:   Mr Cornelius, you say there was or there were no </p>
<p class="line" id="line2283"><a name="pos2283"></a>members of the Security Forces in that Tavern, did I heard you </p>
<p class="line" id="line2284"><a name="pos2284"></a>correctly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2285"><a name="pos2285"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   To my knowledge, I couldn't identify anybody </p>
<p class="line" id="line2286"><a name="pos2286"></a>by their dress, as military people or Security Forces, for that matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2287"><a name="pos2287"></a>ADV SANDI:   Save for uniform, is there any other way in which </p>
<p class="line" id="line2288"><a name="pos2288"></a>one could have identified any such members at the Tavern?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2289"><a name="pos2289"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   Mr Chairman, the only way I think you could </p>
<p class="line" id="line2290"><a name="pos2290"></a>maybe have identified them is if they openly wore weapons on them, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2291"><a name="pos2291"></a>and I certainly and I was never in that frame of mind, to even look </p>
<p class="line" id="line2292"><a name="pos2292"></a>at things like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2293"><a name="pos2293"></a>FURTHER CROSS-EXAMINATION BY ADV ARENDSE:	Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line2294"><a name="pos2294"></a>Chairman, just one question.  Were you going to ask a question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2295"><a name="pos2295"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2296"><a name="pos2296"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Just arising from Adv Sandi's question.  We </p>
<p class="line" id="line2297"><a name="pos2297"></a>know now that Ciska du Plessis was in the Tavern and she I think </p>
<p class="line" id="line2298"><a name="pos2298"></a>still is a member of the South African Police.  So there was one </p>
<p class="line" id="line2299"><a name="pos2299"></a>member of the Security Forces in the Tavern.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2300"><a name="pos2300"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   I believe there was, and I believe she is a PRO, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2301"><a name="pos2301"></a>working in the Police Force.  I don't believe that she is an </p>

<p class="line" id="line2303"><a name="pos2303"></a>Public Relations Officer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2304"><a name="pos2304"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Then also following on that, at that time of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2305"><a name="pos2305"></a>night, would one expect members of the Security Forces to be in </p>
<p class="line" id="line2306"><a name="pos2306"></a>uniform unless it is at the army barracks or at a military base which </p>
<p class="line" id="line2307"><a name="pos2307"></a>clearly this wasn't?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2308"><a name="pos2308"></a>MR CORNELIUS:   Security Forces in my opinion include </p>
<p class="line" id="line2309"><a name="pos2309"></a>Policemen and if we are led to believe that this venue was chosen </p>
<p class="line" id="line2310"><a name="pos2310"></a>because it was frequented by Security Personnel, on that basis, I </p>
<p class="line" id="line2311"><a name="pos2311"></a>would certainly expect that it would at least be at least maybe 30 or </p>
<p class="line" id="line2312"><a name="pos2312"></a>40 percent of the people inside would be Policemen, whether they </p>
<p class="line" id="line2313"><a name="pos2313"></a>were off duty or not, whether they were clothed in Police clothes or </p>
<p class="line" id="line2314"><a name="pos2314"></a>not, I believe there was only one person in there, amongst a packed  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2315"><a name="pos2315"></a>place full of students.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2316"><a name="pos2316"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   No further questions, thank you.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2326"><a name="pos2326"></a>EXAMINATION BY MR PRIOR:	Mr January, how old are you </p>
<p class="line" id="line2327"><a name="pos2327"></a>at present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2328"><a name="pos2328"></a>MR JANUARY:   At present I am 30 years old.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2330"><a name="pos2330"></a>MR JANUARY:   No, I am not married.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2331"><a name="pos2331"></a>MR PRIOR:   Is it correct that you were injured at the Heidelberg </p>
<p class="line" id="line2332"><a name="pos2332"></a>Tavern during the attack by the applicants, on the night of the 30th </p>
<p class="line" id="line2333"><a name="pos2333"></a>of December 1993?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2334"><a name="pos2334"></a>MR JANUARY:   I was injured in the Heidelberg Tavern on the </p>

<p class="line" id="line2336"><a name="pos2336"></a>MR PRIOR:   Is it correct that you have compiled your own </p>
<p class="line" id="line2337"><a name="pos2337"></a>submissions together with certain annexures supporting your claim </p>
<p class="line" id="line2338"><a name="pos2338"></a>for compensation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2339"><a name="pos2339"></a>MR JANUARY:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2340"><a name="pos2340"></a>MR PRIOR:   And it has been explained to you that we will not deal </p>
<p class="line" id="line2341"><a name="pos2341"></a>in any detail with the claim for compensation but this will on your </p>
<p class="line" id="line2342"><a name="pos2342"></a>request, be referred to the Reparations Committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2343"><a name="pos2343"></a>MR JANUARY:   That is what I understand, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2344"><a name="pos2344"></a>MR PRIOR:   You indicated to me as well, that you wanted to read </p>
<p class="line" id="line2345"><a name="pos2345"></a>out onto the record, to the Committee your submissions as you had </p>
<p class="line" id="line2346"><a name="pos2346"></a>prepared them, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2347"><a name="pos2347"></a>MR JANUARY:   Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2348"><a name="pos2348"></a>MR PRIOR:   Would you please proceed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2349"><a name="pos2349"></a>MR JANUARY:   Thank you Mr Prior.  Before the attack on the, Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line2350"><a name="pos2350"></a>Chairman, I will just be paraphrasing my submissions, because they </p>
<p class="line" id="line2351"><a name="pos2351"></a>are quite extensive, I will just paraphrase them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2352"><a name="pos2352"></a>	Before the attack on the Heidelberg Tavern, I was a </p>
<p class="line" id="line2353"><a name="pos2353"></a>businessman.   I was the sole proprietor of a business which </p>
<p class="line" id="line2354"><a name="pos2354"></a>supported myself and also in a large measure, supported my parents </p>
<p class="line" id="line2355"><a name="pos2355"></a>who at the time were on pension.  The business I owned where I also </p>
<p class="line" id="line2356"><a name="pos2356"></a>employed specifically my younger brother and it was his sole source </p>
<p class="line" id="line2357"><a name="pos2357"></a>of income at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2358"><a name="pos2358"></a>MR PRIOR:   What kind of business was it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2359"><a name="pos2359"></a>MR JANUARY:   The work was computer related.  We did a full </p>
<p class="line" id="line2360"><a name="pos2360"></a>range of services from desk top publishing through to installations </p>
<p class="line" id="line2361"><a name="pos2361"></a>of computers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2362"><a name="pos2362"></a>	On the night of the incident, the 30th of December 1993, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2363"><a name="pos2363"></a>myself and my cousin, Grant January stopped at the Heidelberg </p>
<p class="line" id="line2364"><a name="pos2364"></a>Tavern in Observatory.  Within minutes of entering the Tavern, we </p>
<p class="line" id="line2365"><a name="pos2365"></a>had barely sat down, there were loud popping noises which I </p>
<p class="line" id="line2366"><a name="pos2366"></a>immediately identified as gunfire.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2367"><a name="pos2367"></a>	I wasn't at that point sure whether the gunfire was inside or </p>
<p class="line" id="line2368"><a name="pos2368"></a>outside the Tavern, but judged it safe to or the safest course being </p>
<p class="line" id="line2369"><a name="pos2369"></a>to take cover under the table at which I was sitting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2370"><a name="pos2370"></a>	Early in the shooting, I was hit in the back of my left leg </p>
<p class="line" id="line2371"><a name="pos2371"></a>which caused extensive injuries to my leg and pelvis.  I will briefly </p>
<p class="line" id="line2372"><a name="pos2372"></a>outline the nature of those injuries.  The bullet resulted in a </p>
<p class="line" id="line2373"><a name="pos2373"></a>shattered thigh bone and I got a 40 cm steel pin which runs from my </p>
<p class="line" id="line2374"><a name="pos2374"></a>knee to my hip joint.  I have also since about a year after the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2375"><a name="pos2375"></a>incident, on the 8th of November 1994, I had a nerve graph to try </p>
<p class="line" id="line2376"><a name="pos2376"></a>and repair extensive nerve damage within my left leg, but this has </p>
<p class="line" id="line2377"><a name="pos2377"></a>not had much effect.  With the result that my left leg is still pretty </p>
<p class="line" id="line2378"><a name="pos2378"></a>useless today and I walk with a limp.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2379"><a name="pos2379"></a>	I have been recommended by a family Doctor to walk at least </p>
<p class="line" id="line2380"><a name="pos2380"></a>with a stick.  For the first year I used crutches exclusively, but since </p>
<p class="line" id="line2381"><a name="pos2381"></a>1995 I have been able to walk without the use of crutches and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2382"><a name="pos2382"></a>although on recommendation I should be using a stick, I find this </p>
<p class="line" id="line2383"><a name="pos2383"></a>impractical for the type of work I do at the moment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2384"><a name="pos2384"></a>	While I was in hospital and on crutches and in the first few </p>
<p class="line" id="line2385"><a name="pos2385"></a>months after I was shot, the nature of my injuries was such that I </p>
<p class="line" id="line2386"><a name="pos2386"></a>was unable to continue with my business.  It resulted in the loss of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2387"><a name="pos2387"></a>that business.  My brother was without work and my parents were </p>
<p class="line" id="line2388"><a name="pos2388"></a>without the support I had provided them.  In fact the situation had </p>
<p class="line" id="line2389"><a name="pos2389"></a>been reversed, it was now my parents who supported me and my </p>
<p class="line" id="line2390"><a name="pos2390"></a>brother was left to find employment elsewhere, which he eventually </p>
<p class="line" id="line2391"><a name="pos2391"></a>did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2392"><a name="pos2392"></a>	Needless to say, being a cripple today as it were, I have </p>
<p class="line" id="line2393"><a name="pos2393"></a>suffered extensively in terms of pain, discomfort, I've had a </p>
<p class="line" id="line2394"><a name="pos2394"></a>complete change of lifestyle, the loss of my business, the loss of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2395"><a name="pos2395"></a>income and the work I do today, in no way can be compared to what </p>
<p class="line" id="line2396"><a name="pos2396"></a>I used to do before I was so injured.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2397"><a name="pos2397"></a>	In this last four years, I have also lost many friends and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2398"><a name="pos2398"></a>alienated family members as a result of behaviour and personality </p>
<p class="line" id="line2399"><a name="pos2399"></a>changes due to depression, frustration and bitterness.  Many days I </p>
<p class="line" id="line2400"><a name="pos2400"></a>was unable to get myself out of bed in the morning, because I felt </p>
<p class="line" id="line2401"><a name="pos2401"></a>not only had I lost the use of my leg, I had also lost my business, my </p>
<p class="line" id="line2402"><a name="pos2402"></a>income, my whole future as it were.  Often I felt that there was no </p>
<p class="line" id="line2403"><a name="pos2403"></a>reason to go on, or to do anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2404"><a name="pos2404"></a>	Even today I suffer from continuous discomfort and after a </p>
<p class="line" id="line2405"><a name="pos2405"></a>long day of work, I often have to ask a family member for a massage </p>
<p class="line" id="line2406"><a name="pos2406"></a>to ease back pain and pain in my hip.  The loss of sensation which I </p>
<p class="line" id="line2407"><a name="pos2407"></a>have suffered in my left leg, is extremely dangerous as well, as I </p>
<p class="line" id="line2408"><a name="pos2408"></a>often step in things or bang my leg or foot against obstructions </p>
<p class="line" id="line2409"><a name="pos2409"></a>without realising that I have done so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2410"><a name="pos2410"></a>	If I am lucky this only results in a fall which is not too bad, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2411"><a name="pos2411"></a>and I have learnt to cope with it, but sometimes I have hurt myself </p>
<p class="line" id="line2412"><a name="pos2412"></a>more than I realised.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2413"><a name="pos2413"></a>	Regarding my position on amnesty I would also like to say the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2414"><a name="pos2414"></a>following.  It has been an exceptionally difficult four years since my </p>
<p class="line" id="line2415"><a name="pos2415"></a>disability.  I have suffered from a great many things.  I have </p>
<p class="line" id="line2416"><a name="pos2416"></a>undergone various operations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2417"><a name="pos2417"></a>	I lost my business, etc.  I have continually prayed to God to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2418"><a name="pos2418"></a>give me strength to face these hardships and the courage to forgive </p>
<p class="line" id="line2419"><a name="pos2419"></a>the men who inflicted this disaster on my family.  This forgiveness </p>
<p class="line" id="line2420"><a name="pos2420"></a>did not come easily and for many years I dreamt of vengeance as it </p>
<p class="line" id="line2421"><a name="pos2421"></a>were, of somehow getting my own back, but I can now say that the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2422"><a name="pos2422"></a>Lord God, my Saviour, has given me the strength to unconditionally </p>
<p class="line" id="line2423"><a name="pos2423"></a>forgive these men regardless of whether they are asking for </p>
<p class="line" id="line2424"><a name="pos2424"></a>forgiveness or not.  I unconditionally forgive them for what they </p>
<p class="line" id="line2425"><a name="pos2425"></a>have done to me personally, however, I obviously cannot - it is not </p>
<p class="line" id="line2426"><a name="pos2426"></a>my place to forgive them for what they have done to the other </p>
<p class="line" id="line2427"><a name="pos2427"></a>people who have suffered as a result of their actions.  Or as it were </p>
<p class="line" id="line2428"><a name="pos2428"></a>for what this country has had to go through as a result of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2429"><a name="pos2429"></a>actions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2430"><a name="pos2430"></a>	I cannot say with any truth that I have forgiven the people </p>
<p class="line" id="line2431"><a name="pos2431"></a>who sent them.  Neither can I say with any truth that I have forgiven </p>
<p class="line" id="line2432"><a name="pos2432"></a>the system that left my family and me to suffer for the last four </p>
<p class="line" id="line2433"><a name="pos2433"></a>years.  We did not receive so much as a phone call to provide us </p>
<p class="line" id="line2434"><a name="pos2434"></a>with relief in the last four years, not from any person in Government </p>
<p class="line" id="line2435"><a name="pos2435"></a>or any Commission set up by the Government.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2436"><a name="pos2436"></a>	This is the bitterness that drives me to thinking of the Truth </p>
<p class="line" id="line2437"><a name="pos2437"></a>and Reconciliation Commission as no more than a mechanism of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2438"><a name="pos2438"></a>system to forgive itself and whitewash the suffering that myself, my </p>
<p class="line" id="line2439"><a name="pos2439"></a>family and the people of this country, have endured.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2440"><a name="pos2440"></a>	Despite having forgiven the men who shot me, I still wish to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2441"><a name="pos2441"></a>hear the truth.  Why were we victimised, what did they hope to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2442"><a name="pos2442"></a>achieve by what they did to us?  I can't honestly think that they </p>
<p class="line" id="line2443"><a name="pos2443"></a>believed that what they did to us, has achieved anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2444"><a name="pos2444"></a>	I hope that these men will not receive amnesty unless they </p>
<p class="line" id="line2445"><a name="pos2445"></a>come forward with the whole truth and expose all the (indistinct) </p>
<p class="line" id="line2446"><a name="pos2446"></a>behind this event.  I don't know if the Truth Commission will follow </p>
<p class="line" id="line2447"><a name="pos2447"></a>up all the people responsible, or even if all of them have applied for </p>
<p class="line" id="line2448"><a name="pos2448"></a>amnesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2449"><a name="pos2449"></a>	As a result of attending, further to the submissions that I have </p>
<p class="line" id="line2450"><a name="pos2450"></a>made and which I have summarised, I also wish to say that as a </p>
<p class="line" id="line2451"><a name="pos2451"></a>result of attending these hearings now and listen to the applications </p>
<p class="line" id="line2452"><a name="pos2452"></a>and read in fact some of the applications that has been made, I find </p>
<p class="line" id="line2453"><a name="pos2453"></a>it most disconcerting that the applications these men have made, are </p>
<p class="line" id="line2454"><a name="pos2454"></a>very vague.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2455"><a name="pos2455"></a>	In fairness to them, I would say that regarding the position </p>
<p class="line" id="line2456"><a name="pos2456"></a>they were in, they were probably not given enough time to make a </p>
<p class="line" id="line2457"><a name="pos2457"></a>full application, but the impression certainly as in this hearing is that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2458"><a name="pos2458"></a>the full disclosure has not been made.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2459"><a name="pos2459"></a>	More facts are continually being extracted in these hearings </p>
<p class="line" id="line2460"><a name="pos2460"></a>and added and amended to the applicants' statements but which for </p>
<p class="line" id="line2461"><a name="pos2461"></a>some reason, was not part of the original statement, that these </p>
<p class="line" id="line2462"><a name="pos2462"></a>applicants have made.  For their sake, I hope that this is not </p>
<p class="line" id="line2463"><a name="pos2463"></a>construed as deliberate attempts to be vague, but for example Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line2464"><a name="pos2464"></a>Madasi's admission that he was inside the Tavern, was a crucial </p>
<p class="line" id="line2465"><a name="pos2465"></a>piece of information which should have been in his original </p>
<p class="line" id="line2466"><a name="pos2466"></a>statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2467"><a name="pos2467"></a>	I hope that this does not negatively impact on Mr Madasi's </p>
<p class="line" id="line2468"><a name="pos2468"></a>application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2469"><a name="pos2469"></a>	I do also feel that I know something of where these men come </p>
<p class="line" id="line2470"><a name="pos2470"></a>from emotionally and politically as I myself have experienced </p>
<p class="line" id="line2471"><a name="pos2471"></a>oppression in the schools and in the townships in which I was raised. </p>
<p class="line" id="line2472"><a name="pos2472"></a> And yet for all that our family have experienced, I can say that my </p>
<p class="line" id="line2473"><a name="pos2473"></a>family has experienced a lot under Apartheid and under the racist </p>
<p class="line" id="line2474"><a name="pos2474"></a>regime of the National Party, yet, we never turned to the course </p>
<p class="line" id="line2475"><a name="pos2475"></a>they took.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2476"><a name="pos2476"></a>	It has often been said by various people in Government, that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2477"><a name="pos2477"></a>the actions of freedom fighters should be considered in the light that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2478"><a name="pos2478"></a>they were fighting a just cause, a just and noble cause, being the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2479"><a name="pos2479"></a>freedom and justice for all the people of this country.  However, in </p>
<p class="line" id="line2480"><a name="pos2480"></a>the light of that cause shouldn't the actions they take to further that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2481"><a name="pos2481"></a>cause, reflect the nobility and the justice of the cause for which they </p>
<p class="line" id="line2482"><a name="pos2482"></a>are fighting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2483"><a name="pos2483"></a>	I don't think indiscriminate murder can properly be considered </p>
<p class="line" id="line2484"><a name="pos2484"></a>in the light of a just war.  Many freedom fighters, many soldiers for </p>
<p class="line" id="line2485"><a name="pos2485"></a>the cause of liberation, have done sometimes many brave things and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2486"><a name="pos2486"></a>very courageous things and all of this, in a very noble course and I </p>
<p class="line" id="line2487"><a name="pos2487"></a>think that many of them, would not want to be considered as </p>
<p class="line" id="line2488"><a name="pos2488"></a>indiscriminate murderers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2489"><a name="pos2489"></a>	My differences are not with these individuals though, but with </p>
<p class="line" id="line2490"><a name="pos2490"></a>the mentality of an organisation which led to its soldiers and allowed </p>
<p class="line" id="line2491"><a name="pos2491"></a>those soldiers to attack its own Government.  We all know that the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2492"><a name="pos2492"></a>peace negotiations were well on the way by the time this attack took </p>
<p class="line" id="line2493"><a name="pos2493"></a>place.  In fact the National Party, the racist regime, had already </p>
<p class="line" id="line2494"><a name="pos2494"></a>transferred power to the Transitional Executive Council and the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2495"><a name="pos2495"></a>elections was almost inevitable, but this organisation had the gall to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2496"><a name="pos2496"></a>allow these men to be tried and sentenced while its leaders embraced </p>
<p class="line" id="line2497"><a name="pos2497"></a>the gravy train as it has been called.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2498"><a name="pos2498"></a>	Where are these leaders today?  They are hiding behind these </p>
<p class="line" id="line2499"><a name="pos2499"></a>men who are being duped into losing their chance at amnesty while </p>
<p class="line" id="line2500"><a name="pos2500"></a>the leaders continue on that gravy train.  I am opposed to amnesty, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2501"><a name="pos2501"></a>not on the grounds of truth or the disclosure of these men, but that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2502"><a name="pos2502"></a>amnesty cannot be given to us the survivors.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2503"><a name="pos2503"></a>	Mr Prior has attempted on various occasions to explain to me </p>
<p class="line" id="line2504"><a name="pos2504"></a>the nature of these proceedings and amnesty, and he explained to me </p>
<p class="line" id="line2505"><a name="pos2505"></a>that the word amnesty as derived from the Greek word amnesia, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2506"><a name="pos2506"></a>which means to forget.  Well, we cannot forget.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2507"><a name="pos2507"></a>	A just war is understandable, but granting amnesty to people </p>
<p class="line" id="line2508"><a name="pos2508"></a>who killed indiscriminately will be condoning the actions of every </p>
<p class="line" id="line2509"><a name="pos2509"></a>single individual worldwide, who has ever planted a bomb on an </p>
<p class="line" id="line2510"><a name="pos2510"></a>airplane, machine gunned a restaurant or killed innocent people in </p>
<p class="line" id="line2511"><a name="pos2511"></a>the name of political idealism.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2512"><a name="pos2512"></a>	I don't think that is the message South Africa wants to send </p>
<p class="line" id="line2513"><a name="pos2513"></a>out to the world that killing innocent people is justifiable, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2514"><a name="pos2514"></a>politically.  If you are going to be fighting a just war, then you must </p>
<p class="line" id="line2515"><a name="pos2515"></a>consider your actions in the light of the cause for which you are </p>
<p class="line" id="line2516"><a name="pos2516"></a>fighting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2517"><a name="pos2517"></a>	I would almost go so far as to say that the actions, not </p>
<p class="line" id="line2518"><a name="pos2518"></a>necessarily by the three gentlemen I have in front of me, but the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2519"><a name="pos2519"></a>actions of their leaders by sending them on such an attack, I would </p>
<p class="line" id="line2520"><a name="pos2520"></a>almost go so far as to say that the actions are treasonous in that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2521"><a name="pos2521"></a>their attempt was to derail the peace process and to derail the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2522"><a name="pos2522"></a>elections and would have resulted in great bloodshed for this </p>
<p class="line" id="line2523"><a name="pos2523"></a>country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2524"><a name="pos2524"></a>	So their actions are treasonous to the people of this country </p>
<p class="line" id="line2525"><a name="pos2525"></a>and I don't believe that the attack on the Heidelberg has in any way, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2526"><a name="pos2526"></a>furthered their cause.  In fact, I believe that it was a set back to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2527"><a name="pos2527"></a>their cause and in that light, their actions are treasonous to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2528"><a name="pos2528"></a>cause for which they fought, or claim to have fought.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2529"><a name="pos2529"></a>	That is all I have to say at this point, Mr Chairman, thank </p>
<p class="line" id="line2530"><a name="pos2530"></a>you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2531"><a name="pos2531"></a>MR PRIOR:   There is no further questions, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2532"><a name="pos2532"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR PRIOR</p>
<p class="line" id="line2533"><a name="pos2533"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Arendse, are there any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2534"><a name="pos2534"></a>CROSS-EXAMINATION BY ADV ARENDSE:	Thank you Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line2535"><a name="pos2535"></a>Chairman.  Mr January, you gave evidence at court.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2536"><a name="pos2536"></a>MR JANUARY:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2537"><a name="pos2537"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   And your summary is on page 51 of the record.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2538"><a name="pos2538"></a>MR JANUARY:   Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2539"><a name="pos2539"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   And then you also prepared your own statement </p>
<p class="line" id="line2540"><a name="pos2540"></a>which is on page 2 of the second bundle.  And just your comment </p>
<p class="line" id="line2541"><a name="pos2541"></a>from reading both, it doesn't seem to me that you are saying that the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2542"><a name="pos2542"></a>attackers were inside the Tavern.  Maybe I should read it to you.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2543"><a name="pos2543"></a>On page 51, the second line Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2544"><a name="pos2544"></a>	Michael January and his cousin Grant, were also sitting on the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2545"><a name="pos2545"></a>platform.  Like other persons, he first heard a loud pop sound which </p>
<p class="line" id="line2546"><a name="pos2546"></a>he could not identify and then from close by a series of hard sounds, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2547"><a name="pos2547"></a>very loud sounds, which made it impossible for him to think of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2548"><a name="pos2548"></a>anything else.  All that he could do was to lie down flat on the little </p>
<p class="line" id="line2549"><a name="pos2549"></a>seat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2550"><a name="pos2550"></a>	After a two or three second pause, the shooting started again. </p>
<p class="line" id="line2551"><a name="pos2551"></a> He wanted to hide under the seat when he felt that he was wounded </p>
<p class="line" id="line2552"><a name="pos2552"></a>in the leg.  He attempted to close the wound, the opening of which </p>
<p class="line" id="line2553"><a name="pos2553"></a>was larger than the palm of his hand, while he could see the bullets </p>
<p class="line" id="line2554"><a name="pos2554"></a>hitting all around him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2555"><a name="pos2555"></a>	For a frightening while he lay down very quietly.  Grant them </p>
<p class="line" id="line2556"><a name="pos2556"></a>asked him whether he had been wounded and fetched assistance. </p>
<p class="line" id="line2557"><a name="pos2557"></a>	Then in your prepared statement on page 2, under the sub-</p>
<p class="line" id="line2558"><a name="pos2558"></a>heading the incident you say in the second line of that paragraph </p>
<p class="line" id="line2559"><a name="pos2559"></a>within minutes the shooting started, I didn't see much since the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2560"><a name="pos2560"></a>shooters were in a dark entrance way and shooting through </p>
<p class="line" id="line2561"><a name="pos2561"></a>windows.  I hid under a table but was hit anyway in the back of my </p>
<p class="line" id="line2562"><a name="pos2562"></a>upper left leg thigh.  Just your comment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2563"><a name="pos2563"></a>MR JANUARY:   Yes, I don't know, I am sure that it must have </p>
<p class="line" id="line2564"><a name="pos2564"></a>been taken down in a statement at the time.  I spoke to many </p>
<p class="line" id="line2565"><a name="pos2565"></a>Policemen while I was in hospital.  My feeling has always been, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2566"><a name="pos2566"></a>although I never specifically saw the attackers, from the position I </p>
<p class="line" id="line2567"><a name="pos2567"></a>was at, I didn't have a clear view towards the entrance way, but I </p>
<p class="line" id="line2568"><a name="pos2568"></a>was aware that there was shots coming from the direction of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2569"><a name="pos2569"></a>entrance way.  I was also aware of shots being fired through the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2570"><a name="pos2570"></a>window as from the position at which I was lying, I could clearly see </p>
<p class="line" id="line2571"><a name="pos2571"></a>the windows and the double doors.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2572"><a name="pos2572"></a>	And I could actually see holes appearing in those double </p>
<p class="line" id="line2573"><a name="pos2573"></a>doors and in those windows where the shots were being fired into </p>
<p class="line" id="line2574"><a name="pos2574"></a>the building from outside.  But I was also aware of people shooting </p>
<p class="line" id="line2575"><a name="pos2575"></a>from the direction of the entrance way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2576"><a name="pos2576"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Can I just pass you the photographs, photograph </p>
<p class="line" id="line2577"><a name="pos2577"></a>11 through to 16.  One can see from those photographs Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line2578"><a name="pos2578"></a>Chairman, that shots were fired there through broken windows, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2579"><a name="pos2579"></a>through the door.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2580"><a name="pos2580"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   As I see it, there were four shots fired through </p>
<p class="line" id="line2581"><a name="pos2581"></a>the double door.  Do you agree Mr Arendse?  Two through the glass </p>
<p class="line" id="line2582"><a name="pos2582"></a>and two higher up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2583"><a name="pos2583"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Then there is a broken window.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2584"><a name="pos2584"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   There is a broken window to the right, facing ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line2585"><a name="pos2585"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2586"><a name="pos2586"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   ... where other shots were fired through the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2587"><a name="pos2587"></a>stained glass?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2588"><a name="pos2588"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2589"><a name="pos2589"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   What is the question you want to put to this </p>
<p class="line" id="line2590"><a name="pos2590"></a>witness, Mr Arendse?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2591"><a name="pos2591"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Is that what you were describing, that when you </p>
<p class="line" id="line2592"><a name="pos2592"></a>say you heard or saw shooting through windows, it must have been </p>
<p class="line" id="line2593"><a name="pos2593"></a>that then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2594"><a name="pos2594"></a>MR JANUARY:   Yes, I was sitting on a raised platform.  At least, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2595"><a name="pos2595"></a>at that time I had thrown myself down, but I was on the raised </p>
<p class="line" id="line2596"><a name="pos2596"></a>platform, and I had a direct line of sight to the double door and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2597"><a name="pos2597"></a>those windows and that was definitely one of the directions from </p>
<p class="line" id="line2598"><a name="pos2598"></a>which shots were being fired.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2599"><a name="pos2599"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Okay, now how far is the raised platform from </p>
<p class="line" id="line2600"><a name="pos2600"></a>the double doors and maybe you could just mark again, if someone </p>
<p class="line" id="line2601"><a name="pos2601"></a>could just hand Mr January the sketch plan which is Exhibit B, from </p>
<p class="line" id="line2602"><a name="pos2602"></a>the point - you've got the sketch plan there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2603"><a name="pos2603"></a>MR JANUARY:   Yes, I've got the sketch plan.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2604"><a name="pos2604"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   You see "g" and "f", those are the double doors?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2605"><a name="pos2605"></a>MR JANUARY:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2606"><a name="pos2606"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   From the furthest point in, because we can also </p>
<p class="line" id="line2607"><a name="pos2607"></a>see from the photographs, the double doors are now sort of in, they </p>
<p class="line" id="line2608"><a name="pos2608"></a>are not like that any more today, but they were in then, from the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2609"><a name="pos2609"></a>furthest point in to the raised platform, what is that distance?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2610"><a name="pos2610"></a>MR JANUARY:   The entire area of that front room from about the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2611"><a name="pos2611"></a>staircase to the double doors, the dimensions of that room is about 5 </p>
<p class="line" id="line2612"><a name="pos2612"></a>metres in width to about 10 metres in length.  I was sitting right at </p>
<p class="line" id="line2613"><a name="pos2613"></a>the back of the raised platform where there is a pillar indicated in </p>
<p class="line" id="line2614"><a name="pos2614"></a>line with the staircase, that is above the point "d" that is indicated </p>
<p class="line" id="line2615"><a name="pos2615"></a>on the sketch, there is a pillar above that point, and I was sitting </p>
<p class="line" id="line2616"><a name="pos2616"></a>close to that pillar.  So that would have put me about eight, nine, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2617"><a name="pos2617"></a>maybe ten metres away from the double doors.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2618"><a name="pos2618"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   And you heard the evidence of Mr Cornelius, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2619"><a name="pos2619"></a>how far would you have been from the opening in the wall?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2620"><a name="pos2620"></a>MR JANUARY:   As you can see the opening in the wall is rather </p>
<p class="line" id="line2621"><a name="pos2621"></a>closer to the double doors, but diagonally across from myself, from </p>
<p class="line" id="line2622"><a name="pos2622"></a>where I was sitting in the Tavern, to where that opening is, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2623"><a name="pos2623"></a>distance would have been about five to seven metres maybe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2624"><a name="pos2624"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Thank you Mr Chairman, I've got no further </p>
<p class="line" id="line2625"><a name="pos2625"></a>questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2626"><a name="pos2626"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY ADV ARENDSE</p>
<p class="line" id="line2627"><a name="pos2627"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Any re-examination Mr Prior?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2628"><a name="pos2628"></a>RE-EXAMINATION BY MR PRIOR:   I have no re-examination Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line2629"><a name="pos2629"></a>Chairman.  Is there anything else that Mr January would like to add?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2630"><a name="pos2630"></a>MR JANUARY:   There is one thing that I would like to add.  The </p>
<p class="line" id="line2631"><a name="pos2631"></a>only reason I would like to add this, is that I feel that this hearing is </p>
<p class="line" id="line2632"><a name="pos2632"></a>the only place where such things should be voiced and in terms of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2633"><a name="pos2633"></a>reconciliation it is things that I would like to get off my chest.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2634"><a name="pos2634"></a>	But in some measure, I have a very negative opinion towards </p>
<p class="line" id="line2635"><a name="pos2635"></a>what the Truth Commission is intending to or proposing to do.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line2636"><a name="pos2636"></a>see, I often see the Truth Commission as merely a mechanism for </p>
<p class="line" id="line2637"><a name="pos2637"></a>politicians to give their soldiers amnesty, while those same </p>
<p class="line" id="line2638"><a name="pos2638"></a>politicians are never going to be implicated in the actions which </p>
<p class="line" id="line2639"><a name="pos2639"></a>resulted from decisions they made.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2640"><a name="pos2640"></a>	I believe that amnesty is the reward for the soldiers taking the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2641"><a name="pos2641"></a>fall for decisions which the politicians were responsible for.  Thank </p>
<p class="line" id="line2642"><a name="pos2642"></a>you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2643"><a name="pos2643"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Can I ask you something completely different.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2644"><a name="pos2644"></a>You have been sitting in all this morning, haven't you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2645"><a name="pos2645"></a>MR JANUARY:   Yes, Judge Wilson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2646"><a name="pos2646"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Are you in a position to tell us whether the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2647"><a name="pos2647"></a>shots you heard were single, double, treble shots or whether they </p>
<p class="line" id="line2648"><a name="pos2648"></a>were automatic fire?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2649"><a name="pos2649"></a>MR JANUARY:   Well, during the shooting I wasn't paying much </p>
<p class="line" id="line2650"><a name="pos2650"></a>attention to  how the shots were being fired, there were lots of shots </p>
<p class="line" id="line2651"><a name="pos2651"></a>being fired, but I seem to recall in the hearing from Mr Madasi's </p>
<p class="line" id="line2652"><a name="pos2652"></a>statements that he perceived movement and that he directed his fire </p>
<p class="line" id="line2653"><a name="pos2653"></a>towards that movement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2654"><a name="pos2654"></a>	I would infer from that that Mr Madasi implied that he was </p>
<p class="line" id="line2655"><a name="pos2655"></a>directing his fire at movements he could perceive.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2656"><a name="pos2656"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2657"><a name="pos2657"></a>MR JANUARY:   Thank you, Judge Wilson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2658"><a name="pos2658"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   You are excused from further attendance Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line2659"><a name="pos2659"></a>January.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2660"><a name="pos2660"></a>MR JANUARY:   Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2661"><a name="pos2661"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line2662"><a name="pos2662"></a>MR PRIOR:   Mr Chairman, I still have three witnesses to go and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2663"><a name="pos2663"></a>there are one or two other aspects.  One of them that Judge Wilson </p>
<p class="line" id="line2664"><a name="pos2664"></a>raised and it was in my mind all along and we have discussed that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2665"><a name="pos2665"></a>with the Investigators to obtain better evidence regarding, if such </p>
<p class="line" id="line2666"><a name="pos2666"></a>evidence is available, to assist the Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2667"><a name="pos2667"></a>	I see it is one o'clock, I don't know what the ruling would be </p>
<p class="line" id="line2668"><a name="pos2668"></a>regarding the adjournment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2669"><a name="pos2669"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   We will take the long adjournment now, but can </p>
<p class="line" id="line2670"><a name="pos2670"></a>we resume at a quarter to two Mr Arendse?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2671"><a name="pos2671"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2672"><a name="pos2672"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Will you arrange to see that your clients are </p>
<p class="line" id="line2673"><a name="pos2673"></a>brought in in time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2674"><a name="pos2674"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Yes.  It would of course help Mr Chairman, if </p>
<p class="line" id="line2675"><a name="pos2675"></a>any of the other witnesses, if their statements are not already with </p>
<p class="line" id="line2676"><a name="pos2676"></a>me, if it could perhaps be provided during the break so that we can </p>
<p class="line" id="line2677"><a name="pos2677"></a>just, whatever delay there might be, so that we could just avoid that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2678"><a name="pos2678"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   What is the position Mr Prior, is there a </p>
<p class="line" id="line2679"><a name="pos2679"></a>likelihood that we would finish with the oral evidence this </p>
<p class="line" id="line2680"><a name="pos2680"></a>afternoon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2681"><a name="pos2681"></a>MR PRIOR:   Of all the victims?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2682"><a name="pos2682"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2683"><a name="pos2683"></a>MR PRIOR:   There seems a possibility at the rate that we have been </p>
<p class="line" id="line2684"><a name="pos2684"></a>able to get through the evidence, but I don't have the other </p>
<p class="line" id="line2685"><a name="pos2685"></a>evidence, the technical evidence regarding cartridges and I may also </p>
<p class="line" id="line2686"><a name="pos2686"></a>indicate to the Commission that I am investigating whether a residue </p>
<p class="line" id="line2687"><a name="pos2687"></a>test was done on the body of Mr Cerqueira, particularly on his hand </p>
<p class="line" id="line2688"><a name="pos2688"></a>to indicate possibly whether he fired or not.  I am trying to locate </p>
<p class="line" id="line2689"><a name="pos2689"></a>that information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2690"><a name="pos2690"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Well, then we are bound to - we are faced with </p>
<p class="line" id="line2691"><a name="pos2691"></a>the situation that at some stage or the other, we are going to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2692"><a name="pos2692"></a>adjourn, leaving this matter incomplete.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2693"><a name="pos2693"></a>MR PRIOR:   That is so Mr Chairman.  But certainly I would be able </p>
<p class="line" id="line2694"><a name="pos2694"></a>depending on my learned friend, but we seem to have got through at </p>
<p class="line" id="line2695"><a name="pos2695"></a>least more than half of the witnesses this morning, to maybe even </p>
<p class="line" id="line2696"><a name="pos2696"></a>complete the submissions of the victims.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2697"><a name="pos2697"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Are there any victims who come from outside of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2698"><a name="pos2698"></a>Cape Town who might be inconvenienced if we didn't hear their </p>
<p class="line" id="line2699"><a name="pos2699"></a>evidence this afternoon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2700"><a name="pos2700"></a>MR PRIOR:   The remaining victims are from the Cape Town </p>
<p class="line" id="line2701"><a name="pos2701"></a>surrounding area, except that at least two of the persons work is </p>
<p class="line" id="line2702"><a name="pos2702"></a>being effected.  I have been informed by their employers that they </p>
<p class="line" id="line2703"><a name="pos2703"></a>loath to extend any further time from work, however a letter from </p>
<p class="line" id="line2704"><a name="pos2704"></a>the Commission will suffice, but they have indicated they have </p>
<p class="line" id="line2705"><a name="pos2705"></a>already given a week to these people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2706"><a name="pos2706"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   We will resume, we will adjourn now, and resume </p>
<p class="line" id="line2707"><a name="pos2707"></a>at quarter to two.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2710"><a name="pos2710"></a>MR PRIOR:   Thank you Mr Chairman, I call as my next witness Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line2711"><a name="pos2711"></a>Roland Lewis Palm.  His submissions appear at page 34 of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2712"><a name="pos2712"></a>bundle.  Mr Palm has requested that I assist him in reading out the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2713"><a name="pos2713"></a>statement to the Commission.  Is there any difficulty with that Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line2714"><a name="pos2714"></a>Chairman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2715"><a name="pos2715"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   No difficulty at all. </p>

<p class="line" id="line2717"><a name="pos2717"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you, do sit down Mr Palm.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2719"><a name="pos2719"></a>are the father of one of the deceased in the Heidelberg Tavern </p>
<p class="line" id="line2720"><a name="pos2720"></a>attack, Rolanda Palm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2721"><a name="pos2721"></a>MR PALM:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2722"><a name="pos2722"></a>MR PRIOR:   Is it also correct that you were present during the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2723"><a name="pos2723"></a>attack at the Heidelberg Tavern on the 30th of December 1993?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2724"><a name="pos2724"></a>MR PALM:   That is also correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2725"><a name="pos2725"></a>MR PRIOR:   Mr Palm is it correct that you pursuant to appearing </p>
<p class="line" id="line2726"><a name="pos2726"></a>before the Committee, have consulted with me on a number of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2727"><a name="pos2727"></a>occasions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2728"><a name="pos2728"></a>MR PALM:   That is also correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2729"><a name="pos2729"></a>MR PRIOR:   That you supplied me with documentation and a </p>
<p class="line" id="line2730"><a name="pos2730"></a>statement relating to submissions that you wish to make to this </p>
<p class="line" id="line2731"><a name="pos2731"></a>Committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2732"><a name="pos2732"></a>MR PALM:   That is right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2733"><a name="pos2733"></a>MR PRIOR:   Is it also correct that you requested me to assist you </p>
<p class="line" id="line2734"><a name="pos2734"></a>drafting the submissions you wanted to make to the Committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2735"><a name="pos2735"></a>MR PALM:   That is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2736"><a name="pos2736"></a>MR PRIOR:   And is it also correct that you have indicated to me </p>
<p class="line" id="line2737"><a name="pos2737"></a>that you wish me to read out on your behalf, the submissions that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2738"><a name="pos2738"></a>you have made?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2739"><a name="pos2739"></a>MR PALM:   That I have done, because the reason being I don't </p>
<p class="line" id="line2740"><a name="pos2740"></a>want to go through that emotions again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2741"><a name="pos2741"></a>MR PRIOR:   I just want for the record, are you on any medication </p>
<p class="line" id="line2742"><a name="pos2742"></a>at the moment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2743"><a name="pos2743"></a>MR PALM:   Well, I am taking depressive tablets.  Well, I have been </p>
<p class="line" id="line2744"><a name="pos2744"></a>on it for quite a while, that is all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2745"><a name="pos2745"></a>MR PRIOR:   All right.  Please listen, and we will go through the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2746"><a name="pos2746"></a>statement.  During October of 1992 my son, Brandon Clinton Palm </p>
<p class="line" id="line2747"><a name="pos2747"></a>was convicted of attempted murder and robbery and sentenced to 12 </p>
<p class="line" id="line2748"><a name="pos2748"></a>years imprisonment. </p>
<p class="line" id="line2749"><a name="pos2749"></a>	Brandon had always maintained his innocence and after five </p>
<p class="line" id="line2750"><a name="pos2750"></a>years of incarceration, still maintains that he was falsely implicated </p>
<p class="line" id="line2751"><a name="pos2751"></a>in these crimes by members of the Murder and Robbery Unit, Cape </p>
<p class="line" id="line2752"><a name="pos2752"></a>Town.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2753"><a name="pos2753"></a>	By all accounts the crimes lacked motive and seemed </p>
<p class="line" id="line2754"><a name="pos2754"></a>improbable as the victim worked in the same building where my son </p>
<p class="line" id="line2755"><a name="pos2755"></a>was employed as a security guard where the alleged attack took </p>
<p class="line" id="line2756"><a name="pos2756"></a>place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2757"><a name="pos2757"></a>	Since 1992, my wife and I have pursued an arduous course of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2758"><a name="pos2758"></a>leave to appeal for retrial, review, Ministries of Law and Order, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2759"><a name="pos2759"></a>Justice, Correctional Services under the old and new Governments.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2760"><a name="pos2760"></a>The office of the Public Protector, Human Rights Commission, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2761"><a name="pos2761"></a>office of Mandela and lastly the Truth and Reconciliation </p>
<p class="line" id="line2762"><a name="pos2762"></a>Commission all to no avail. </p>
<p class="line" id="line2763"><a name="pos2763"></a>	As a result of this situation, my daughter Rolanda Lucille </p>
<p class="line" id="line2764"><a name="pos2764"></a>Palm came to live in Cape Town in order to assist her brother and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2765"><a name="pos2765"></a>family in pursuing justice.  On the evening of the 30th of December </p>
<p class="line" id="line2766"><a name="pos2766"></a>1993, Rolanda and I were discussing the information she had </p>
<p class="line" id="line2767"><a name="pos2767"></a>obtained concerning the complainant in my son's case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2768"><a name="pos2768"></a>	We were sitting in the Heidelberg Tavern in Observatory, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2769"><a name="pos2769"></a>enjoying a drink.  She had agreed to accompany me to the Tavern in </p>
<p class="line" id="line2770"><a name="pos2770"></a>order to get out of the house for a short while.  We left home at </p>
<p class="line" id="line2771"><a name="pos2771"></a>about 10h35 pm and walked to the Heidelberg as it was five minutes </p>
<p class="line" id="line2772"><a name="pos2772"></a>away from my residence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2773"><a name="pos2773"></a>	On arriving, I ushered my daughter into the restaurant area of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2774"><a name="pos2774"></a>the Heidelberg, because I wanted to have a private discussion away </p>
<p class="line" id="line2775"><a name="pos2775"></a>from the noise of the music they were playing there.  On sitting her </p>
<p class="line" id="line2776"><a name="pos2776"></a>down at the dining area, I walked to the bar, ordered a beer for </p>
<p class="line" id="line2777"><a name="pos2777"></a>myself and a cooldrink for her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2778"><a name="pos2778"></a>	Upon sitting down at the table, I referred to my watch.  The </p>
<p class="line" id="line2779"><a name="pos2779"></a>reason I looked at my watch is that my daughter had just arrived </p>
<p class="line" id="line2780"><a name="pos2780"></a>from an afternoon shift at work and she was quite tired.  My </p>
<p class="line" id="line2781"><a name="pos2781"></a>intention was not to keep her out late.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2782"><a name="pos2782"></a>	We sat down, had a discussion which on estimate could have </p>
<p class="line" id="line2783"><a name="pos2783"></a>lasted for about 20 minutes.  While we were talking, I heard a </p>
<p class="line" id="line2784"><a name="pos2784"></a>spattered noise which was very strange.  I glanced up, over her </p>
<p class="line" id="line2785"><a name="pos2785"></a>shoulder to where the sound was coming from.  I noticed sparks, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2786"><a name="pos2786"></a>smoke, glasses breaking.  I realised this was because someone was </p>
<p class="line" id="line2787"><a name="pos2787"></a>shooting into the Tavern.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2788"><a name="pos2788"></a>	I did not see who was doing the shooting as my vision was </p>
<p class="line" id="line2789"><a name="pos2789"></a>blocked by a column in the Tavern.  On realising it was gunfire, I </p>
<p class="line" id="line2790"><a name="pos2790"></a>immediately stretched over the table, pulled my daughter and said </p>
<p class="line" id="line2791"><a name="pos2791"></a>get down.  In that motion, I fell onto the bench and rolled onto the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2792"><a name="pos2792"></a>floor.  My daughter dropped with her head to the table, and her back </p>
<p class="line" id="line2793"><a name="pos2793"></a>was exposed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2794"><a name="pos2794"></a>	A hail of bullets was directed at us and a bottle and other </p>
<p class="line" id="line2795"><a name="pos2795"></a>things on the table, fell onto the floor.  As I tried to look up from </p>
<p class="line" id="line2796"><a name="pos2796"></a>under the table to see who was shooting, I noticed my daughter </p>
<p class="line" id="line2797"><a name="pos2797"></a>reaching the floor slowly.  In the same instance I noticed two other </p>
<p class="line" id="line2798"><a name="pos2798"></a>girls to my right, fly out of their seats.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2799"><a name="pos2799"></a>	Unfortunately all I could see was a cloud of smoke and the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2800"><a name="pos2800"></a>shadow withdrawing.  The next instant I saw this torch light object </p>
<p class="line" id="line2801"><a name="pos2801"></a>which knocked the side panel in the passage and rolled over to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2802"><a name="pos2802"></a>where we were.  I screamed it is a grenade, stay down, not realising </p>
<p class="line" id="line2803"><a name="pos2803"></a>she was already hit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2804"><a name="pos2804"></a>	I still pressed her to the ground, under the table and counted </p>
<p class="line" id="line2805"><a name="pos2805"></a>to ten, waiting for this explosion.  When I realised nothing had </p>
<p class="line" id="line2806"><a name="pos2806"></a>happened, I glanced over to where the object had fallen.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2807"><a name="pos2807"></a>Immediately I noticed a trickle of blood on her shoulder as she was </p>
<p class="line" id="line2808"><a name="pos2808"></a>lying face down.  I immediately jumped from out of where I was </p>
<p class="line" id="line2809"><a name="pos2809"></a>lying to where she was, I turned her over and she just slumped in my </p>
<p class="line" id="line2810"><a name="pos2810"></a>arms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2811"><a name="pos2811"></a>	I realised when looking at her, she was dead and I jumped out </p>
<p class="line" id="line2812"><a name="pos2812"></a>and ran to the door, to look for those responsible for the attack.  As </p>
<p class="line" id="line2813"><a name="pos2813"></a>I got to the door, I looked to my right and my left and immediately </p>
<p class="line" id="line2814"><a name="pos2814"></a>saw a yellow van parked on the corner of Observatory and Lower </p>
<p class="line" id="line2815"><a name="pos2815"></a>Main Road, outside the chemist, facing Mowbray.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2816"><a name="pos2816"></a>	My immediate reaction was, oh, the Police are here already </p>
<p class="line" id="line2817"><a name="pos2817"></a>and I went back into the Tavern to double check on my daughter.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2818"><a name="pos2818"></a>My thoughts were that if the Police were there so soon, they had </p>
<p class="line" id="line2819"><a name="pos2819"></a>obviously caught the perpetrators.  I lifted my daughter up, felt for </p>
<p class="line" id="line2820"><a name="pos2820"></a>her pulse, but my hand just sunk into her neck.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2821"><a name="pos2821"></a>	I laid her down on her back, tried to close her eyes, but they </p>
<p class="line" id="line2822"><a name="pos2822"></a>would not close.  This is when the realisation got to me she was </p>
<p class="line" id="line2823"><a name="pos2823"></a>dead.  I immediately made my way home to tell my wife.  I was </p>
<p class="line" id="line2824"><a name="pos2824"></a>blinded by the shock and the tears.  I passed this van on the corner. </p>
<p class="line" id="line2825"><a name="pos2825"></a> When I passed, I noticed one figure there who had on a white </p>
<p class="line" id="line2826"><a name="pos2826"></a>garment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2827"><a name="pos2827"></a>	When I got to the next corner to turn on my way home, I </p>
<p class="line" id="line2828"><a name="pos2828"></a>looked back, still noticing the van standing on the corner.  Thinking </p>
<p class="line" id="line2829"><a name="pos2829"></a>it was very strange that for a person who had just come out of a </p>
<p class="line" id="line2830"><a name="pos2830"></a>place that had been attacked, that nobody stopped me.  Well, I </p>
<p class="line" id="line2831"><a name="pos2831"></a>managed to get home all hysterical and my wife could not </p>
<p class="line" id="line2832"><a name="pos2832"></a>understand me as I was hysterical and incoherent.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2833"><a name="pos2833"></a>	My wife went to the Tavern to find out what was going on.  A </p>
<p class="line" id="line2834"><a name="pos2834"></a>few days later Des Segal, the Investigating Officer came to my house </p>
<p class="line" id="line2835"><a name="pos2835"></a>to take a statement.  In the course of my making a statement to him, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2836"><a name="pos2836"></a>he said that I must have been drunk as there was no such thing as a </p>
<p class="line" id="line2837"><a name="pos2837"></a>Police van standing there.  I insisted he take it down in his statement </p>
<p class="line" id="line2838"><a name="pos2838"></a>and he did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2839"><a name="pos2839"></a>	He said to me that if there was a Police van there, it must </p>
<p class="line" id="line2840"><a name="pos2840"></a>have been a Police van which had been patrolling the area and had </p>
<p class="line" id="line2841"><a name="pos2841"></a>been radioed to the scene.  It must have been told not to go into the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2842"><a name="pos2842"></a>Tavern as there was a bomb in there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2843"><a name="pos2843"></a>	I immediately became suspicious as I could not understand </p>
<p class="line" id="line2844"><a name="pos2844"></a>how those Policemen could have been radioed and told about a bomb </p>
<p class="line" id="line2845"><a name="pos2845"></a>that was in the Tavern.  I asked him that if they were radioed and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2846"><a name="pos2846"></a>knew about the attack, why they did not stop me after I had come </p>
<p class="line" id="line2847"><a name="pos2847"></a>out of the Tavern.  He could not answer my question and told my </p>
<p class="line" id="line2848"><a name="pos2848"></a>wife that I must have been drunk.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2849"><a name="pos2849"></a>	At the time of the court case, I was never used as a witness.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2850"><a name="pos2850"></a>Des Segal told my wife that he could not use me as I would let the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2851"><a name="pos2851"></a>suspects walk and they are APLA and they are the perpetrators and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2852"><a name="pos2852"></a>they are used to killing people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2853"><a name="pos2853"></a>	He went on to say that if they did not nail them for </p>
<p class="line" id="line2854"><a name="pos2854"></a>Heidelberg, he would not nail them for St James.   Am I going too </p>
<p class="line" id="line2855"><a name="pos2855"></a>quickly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2856"><a name="pos2856"></a>MR PALM:   Sorry, he didn't say that.  He said if he didn't nail them </p>
<p class="line" id="line2857"><a name="pos2857"></a>for the Heidelberg, he will nail them for the St James.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2858"><a name="pos2858"></a>MR PRIOR:   I beg your pardon, can we correct that Mr Chairman.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2859"><a name="pos2859"></a>Just delete the not.  I would like now to describe what kind of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2860"><a name="pos2860"></a>person Rolanda was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2861"><a name="pos2861"></a>	She was a kind, caring and warm hearted young woman.  She </p>
<p class="line" id="line2862"><a name="pos2862"></a>was 22 years old and was a qualified primary school teacher.  She </p>
<p class="line" id="line2863"><a name="pos2863"></a>had shown great tenacity and character in pursuing her studies and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2864"><a name="pos2864"></a>ultimately qualifying.  She was determined and succeeded in making </p>
<p class="line" id="line2865"><a name="pos2865"></a>something out of her short life refusing to conform as so many </p>
<p class="line" id="line2866"><a name="pos2866"></a>young people did to the anti-social drug culture or aimless lifestyle </p>
<p class="line" id="line2867"><a name="pos2867"></a>so many have adopted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2868"><a name="pos2868"></a>	Rolanda was a devout Christian and Roman Catholic.  She </p>
<p class="line" id="line2869"><a name="pos2869"></a>believed in the equality of man and was as a teacher dedicated to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2870"><a name="pos2870"></a>upliftment of her fellow man, particularly children and the aged.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2871"><a name="pos2871"></a>	She did not support any political party.  She appalled </p>
<p class="line" id="line2872"><a name="pos2872"></a>violence, particularly as a means to settle differences.  She believed </p>
<p class="line" id="line2873"><a name="pos2873"></a>in God and that all men were created equal, irrespective of race, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2874"><a name="pos2874"></a>colour or creed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2875"><a name="pos2875"></a>	The irony of her death is that she was not a white person who </p>
<p class="line" id="line2876"><a name="pos2876"></a>according to APLA were the legitimate targets of the death squads.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2877"><a name="pos2877"></a>Neither was Bernadette Langford and Michael January.  I cannot </p>
<p class="line" id="line2878"><a name="pos2878"></a>begin to describe the rage I feel and have felt for the past four years </p>
<p class="line" id="line2879"><a name="pos2879"></a>at her senseless killing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2880"><a name="pos2880"></a>	Rolanda had a tremendous zest for life.  She loved sport, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2881"><a name="pos2881"></a>swimming and athletics were her passion in which she excelled.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2882"><a name="pos2882"></a>	I say to the PAC and APLA and to the applicants you killed </p>
<p class="line" id="line2883"><a name="pos2883"></a>the wrong person.  Rolanda was also joined in the struggle against </p>
<p class="line" id="line2884"><a name="pos2884"></a>the injustice of the Apartheid system, particularly in Education.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2885"><a name="pos2885"></a>	You simply ended her life as if she was a worthless piece of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2886"><a name="pos2886"></a>rubbish.  You say you did so to liberate AZANIA.  I say you did so </p>
<p class="line" id="line2887"><a name="pos2887"></a>for your own selfish and criminal purposes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2888"><a name="pos2888"></a>	You prevented Rolanda from helping rebuild our broken </p>
<p class="line" id="line2889"><a name="pos2889"></a>nation, which if you had simply waited another few months, in fact </p>
<p class="line" id="line2890"><a name="pos2890"></a>came to pass when we had free elections.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2891"><a name="pos2891"></a>	There is a reference to Brigadier Nene, it is actually Brigadier </p>
<p class="line" id="line2892"><a name="pos2892"></a>Phitla.  The spelling in the submissions of the PAC is Phitla, but it </p>
<p class="line" id="line2893"><a name="pos2893"></a>could also be spelt Fitla.  Your Commander, Brigadier Phitla stated </p>
<p class="line" id="line2894"><a name="pos2894"></a>that it was difficult to control the forces on the ground due to lack </p>
<p class="line" id="line2895"><a name="pos2895"></a>of proper communication and proper political training.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2896"><a name="pos2896"></a>	These are simply empty excuses that in fact exposed APLA for </p>
<p class="line" id="line2897"><a name="pos2897"></a>what it was, an unguided missile out of the control of the PAC at </p>
<p class="line" id="line2898"><a name="pos2898"></a>loggerheads with each other and unable to accept the political </p>
<p class="line" id="line2899"><a name="pos2899"></a>decisions of their political masters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2900"><a name="pos2900"></a>	The Brigadier also stated that the cadres as in the case of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2901"><a name="pos2901"></a>applicants, were simply carrying out orders of their Commanders.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2902"><a name="pos2902"></a>Well, if that is so, why haven't the Commanders Letlapa Maphalela </p>
<p class="line" id="line2903"><a name="pos2903"></a>or Andile Mayo Sciceka applied for amnesty?  What are they afraid </p>
<p class="line" id="line2904"><a name="pos2904"></a>of?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2905"><a name="pos2905"></a>	APLA have stated that they were at war with the white </p>
<p class="line" id="line2906"><a name="pos2906"></a>supremist settler regime and that in terms of that were their soldiers </p>
<p class="line" id="line2907"><a name="pos2907"></a>or cadres tasked with destroying the enemy targets, ie the white man </p>
<p class="line" id="line2908"><a name="pos2908"></a>wherever they found them, particularly in order to obtain firearms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2909"><a name="pos2909"></a>	White households and farmers were regarded as military </p>
<p class="line" id="line2910"><a name="pos2910"></a>targets.  What APLA has not explained is how the Heidelberg </p>
<p class="line" id="line2911"><a name="pos2911"></a>Tavern was selected as a military target.  If proper planning and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2912"><a name="pos2912"></a>surveillance had been done, APLA would have discovered the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2913"><a name="pos2913"></a>following.  (1) the Tavern catered for the multi-racial clientele, (2) </p>
<p class="line" id="line2914"><a name="pos2914"></a>the predominant patrons were young students from the University of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2915"><a name="pos2915"></a>Cape Town, (3) the Tavern did not cater exclusively for military </p>
<p class="line" id="line2916"><a name="pos2916"></a>personnel, not could be described by any intelligent person as a </p>
<p class="line" id="line2917"><a name="pos2917"></a>military target where arms could be obtained, (4) its resident </p>
<p class="line" id="line2918"><a name="pos2918"></a>musician was one Josh Sithole, a black man who was loved and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2919"><a name="pos2919"></a>respected throughout the country by multi-racial audiences </p>
<p class="line" id="line2920"><a name="pos2920"></a>countrywide and who was entertaining the patrons at the time of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2921"><a name="pos2921"></a>attack, (5) a better military target and that put in (indistinct), which </p>
<p class="line" id="line2922"><a name="pos2922"></a>fulfilled their criteria, was the Woodstock Police Station, a short </p>
<p class="line" id="line2923"><a name="pos2923"></a>distance away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2924"><a name="pos2924"></a>	APLA as well as the applicants cannot be truthful when they </p>
<p class="line" id="line2925"><a name="pos2925"></a>state that by murdering patrons at the Heidelberg Tavern, this was a </p>
<p class="line" id="line2926"><a name="pos2926"></a>bona fide act associated with the political objective.  What these </p>
<p class="line" id="line2927"><a name="pos2927"></a>amnesty applicants seek to do is to clothe criminal acts which have </p>
<p class="line" id="line2928"><a name="pos2928"></a>already been adjudicated upon by the High Court, in the mantle of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2929"><a name="pos2929"></a>political type conduct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2930"><a name="pos2930"></a>	It was amazing to hear from APLA military intelligence, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2931"><a name="pos2931"></a>Brigadier Phitla that he have never heard of the protocols of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2932"><a name="pos2932"></a>Geneva Convention governing the waging of a war of liberation and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2933"><a name="pos2933"></a>that he had only heard of such rules and regulations when he </p>
<p class="line" id="line2934"><a name="pos2934"></a>recently joined the SANDF.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2935"><a name="pos2935"></a>	It would therefore seem that ignorance of the protection given </p>
<p class="line" id="line2936"><a name="pos2936"></a>to innocent civilians, unconnected to the offensive regime or its </p>
<p class="line" id="line2937"><a name="pos2937"></a>administration in times of conflict, by the Geneva Convention is now </p>
<p class="line" id="line2938"><a name="pos2938"></a>raised as an excuse to justify the very inhumanity witnessed at the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2939"><a name="pos2939"></a>Heidelberg Tavern.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2940"><a name="pos2940"></a>	I maintain that the perpetrators of the killings, when they </p>
<p class="line" id="line2941"><a name="pos2941"></a>entered the Tavern, could have as trained soldiers so we are told, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2942"><a name="pos2942"></a>assessed the situation and seen first hand that the people they were </p>
<p class="line" id="line2943"><a name="pos2943"></a>going to kill, in fact were not the targets they were ordered to kill </p>
<p class="line" id="line2944"><a name="pos2944"></a>and could have turned back, but they did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2945"><a name="pos2945"></a>	The systematic shooting of the patrons as they did, three </p>
<p class="line" id="line2946"><a name="pos2946"></a>females deceased, together with the attempt to explode the nail </p>
<p class="line" id="line2947"><a name="pos2947"></a>studded rifle grenade was not to further any political objective.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2948"><a name="pos2948"></a>What does APLA command mean when it says that it assumes </p>
<p class="line" id="line2949"><a name="pos2949"></a>complete responsibility for the Heidelberg Tavern attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2950"><a name="pos2950"></a>	Does APLA command realise that with responsibility comes </p>
<p class="line" id="line2951"><a name="pos2951"></a>accountability?  I repeat my question, if APLA is genuine about </p>
<p class="line" id="line2952"><a name="pos2952"></a>taking responsibility, why have none of the Commanders applied for </p>
<p class="line" id="line2953"><a name="pos2953"></a>amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2954"><a name="pos2954"></a>	However, APLA tells the world that for what they did at the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2955"><a name="pos2955"></a>Heidelberg Tavern and to my daughter, they will never apologise.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line2956"><a name="pos2956"></a>The killings at Heidelberg Tavern and the attempted justification </p>
<p class="line" id="line2957"><a name="pos2957"></a>thereof by the APLA command, must be viewed soberly against the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2958"><a name="pos2958"></a>background of the political reality as of 30th December 1993.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2959"><a name="pos2959"></a>	(1) The peace process had progressed towards democracy and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2960"><a name="pos2960"></a>the first ever democratic elections were only months away, in fact in </p>
<p class="line" id="line2961"><a name="pos2961"></a>April 1994, (2) the PAC which must have informed its military wing, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2962"><a name="pos2962"></a>APLA, had committed to the peace process and was a willing and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2963"><a name="pos2963"></a>vociferous participant, (3) the PAC had in November of 1992 </p>
<p class="line" id="line2964"><a name="pos2964"></a>pledged a cessation of violent struggle and imposed a moratorium of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2965"><a name="pos2965"></a>violence.  It was reported in the Rapport newspaper on the 2nd of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2966"><a name="pos2966"></a>January 1994, (4) the Apartheid Government had handed control to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2967"><a name="pos2967"></a>the politically negotiated TEC until the elections only a short time </p>
<p class="line" id="line2968"><a name="pos2968"></a>away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2969"><a name="pos2969"></a>	History indicates that a politically negotiated settlement had </p>
<p class="line" id="line2970"><a name="pos2970"></a>in fact won the day.  The liberation struggle had delivered the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2971"><a name="pos2971"></a>goods.  The was was over and that majority ruled.   It seems from </p>
<p class="line" id="line2972"><a name="pos2972"></a>the submissions made by APLA on the 7th of October 1997, before </p>
<p class="line" id="line2973"><a name="pos2973"></a>the TRC, that APLA had on its own decided the war was not over </p>
<p class="line" id="line2974"><a name="pos2974"></a>and in order to keep its support from its followers, it had to be seen </p>
<p class="line" id="line2975"><a name="pos2975"></a>to be retaliating against white people because black people were still </p>
<p class="line" id="line2976"><a name="pos2976"></a>being killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2977"><a name="pos2977"></a>	If this was the rational behind the attacks, then in this context </p>
<p class="line" id="line2978"><a name="pos2978"></a>the Heidelberg attack was nothing more than a reprisal or revenge </p>
<p class="line" id="line2979"><a name="pos2979"></a>attack.  If this is so, political objective cannot be argued.  What the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2980"><a name="pos2980"></a>act of terror did achieve, was the broad condemnation by all </p>
<p class="line" id="line2981"><a name="pos2981"></a>political groups as well as international rebuke.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2982"><a name="pos2982"></a>	Both Zimbabwe and Tanzania are reported to have severely </p>
<p class="line" id="line2983"><a name="pos2983"></a>rebuked APLA, reported in Argus newspaper, 12 January 1994.  The </p>
<p class="line" id="line2984"><a name="pos2984"></a>ANC condemned the killing as being acts of (indistinct) aimed at </p>
<p class="line" id="line2985"><a name="pos2985"></a>derailing the peace process and preventing free and fair elections, </p>
<p class="line" id="line2986"><a name="pos2986"></a>reported in the Rapport, 2nd of January 1994.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2987"><a name="pos2987"></a>	Despite the numerous TRC hearings, amnesty applications and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2988"><a name="pos2988"></a>Police investigations involving hundreds of personnel, thousands of </p>
<p class="line" id="line2989"><a name="pos2989"></a>man hours and possibly millions of rands, we are still no nearer the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2990"><a name="pos2990"></a>complete truth not only in the Heidelberg Tavern matter, but in all </p>
<p class="line" id="line2991"><a name="pos2991"></a>others where gross violations of human rights occurred.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2992"><a name="pos2992"></a>	I firmly believe that a wider conspiracy exists which is yet to </p>
<p class="line" id="line2993"><a name="pos2993"></a>be uncovered.  I shall not rest until it has been and only then </p>
<p class="line" id="line2994"><a name="pos2994"></a>perhaps, shall I be satisfied that justice has been seen to be done and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2995"><a name="pos2995"></a>only then, if those faceless and gutless politicians, military and </p>
<p class="line" id="line2996"><a name="pos2996"></a>Security Force personnel are exposed and prosecuted to the full </p>
<p class="line" id="line2997"><a name="pos2997"></a>extent of the law.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2998"><a name="pos2998"></a>	My unease in this regard is as a result of the following </p>
<p class="line" id="line2999"><a name="pos2999"></a>circumstances.  (1) although I witnessed the attack, saw a Police van </p>
<p class="line" id="line3000"><a name="pos3000"></a>on the scene, I was bullied by Des Segal, the Investigator, to forget </p>
<p class="line" id="line3001"><a name="pos3001"></a>that fact.   When I refused, he tried to discredit me by saying that I </p>
<p class="line" id="line3002"><a name="pos3002"></a>was probably drunk at the time and if I did say what I had seen, at </p>
<p class="line" id="line3003"><a name="pos3003"></a>the trial, it would upset the Prosecution.  As a result I was kept out </p>
<p class="line" id="line3004"><a name="pos3004"></a>of the witness box.  If Segal had simply explained why a van could </p>
<p class="line" id="line3005"><a name="pos3005"></a>have been there, I would possibly have accepted it and called it a </p>
<p class="line" id="line3006"><a name="pos3006"></a>day. </p>
<p class="line" id="line3007"><a name="pos3007"></a>	(2) What was the Police doing there in the first place, where </p>
<p class="line" id="line3008"><a name="pos3008"></a>were the occupants and what were they doing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3009"><a name="pos3009"></a>	(3) The Police investigation had within a very short space of </p>
<p class="line" id="line3010"><a name="pos3010"></a>time, three or four days, solved the case despite six persons arrested </p>
<p class="line" id="line3011"><a name="pos3011"></a>and charged, only three perpetrators stood trial.  The charges were </p>
<p class="line" id="line3012"><a name="pos3012"></a>withdrawn against the rest.  If the evidence was strong enough to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3013"><a name="pos3013"></a>arrest and charge them, why were they not prosecuted?  Was the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3014"><a name="pos3014"></a>conspiracy only limited to these six?  These persons were Theo </p>
<p class="line" id="line3015"><a name="pos3015"></a>Mabusela, Michael Siyolo and Richard Dala.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3016"><a name="pos3016"></a>	(4) The person who supplied the weapons and ammunition to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3017"><a name="pos3017"></a>the perpetrators were known to the Police.  Were they arrested and </p>
<p class="line" id="line3018"><a name="pos3018"></a>later released or are they still at large?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3019"><a name="pos3019"></a>	(5) Letlapa Maphalela, the Director of Military Operations of </p>
<p class="line" id="line3020"><a name="pos3020"></a>APLA is implicated in Heidelberg Tavern, yet is allowed to go free. </p>
<p class="line" id="line3021"><a name="pos3021"></a> He is not applying for amnesty for the Heidelberg Tavern, nor has </p>
<p class="line" id="line3022"><a name="pos3022"></a>he been arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3023"><a name="pos3023"></a>	(6) Other implicated persons are Basie Mcombusi and </p>
<p class="line" id="line3024"><a name="pos3024"></a>Theofolus Sibeko.  Why are they still at large?  There whereabouts </p>
<p class="line" id="line3025"><a name="pos3025"></a>are known to the authorities?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3026"><a name="pos3026"></a>	(7) Denzil Potgieter who defended the killers of my daughter, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3027"><a name="pos3027"></a>now is a Commissioner of the very Committee called upon to grant </p>
<p class="line" id="line3028"><a name="pos3028"></a>them amnesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3029"><a name="pos3029"></a>	(8) Dumisa Ntsebeza, a Commissioner with the TRC, has been </p>
<p class="line" id="line3030"><a name="pos3030"></a>mentioned in connection with the Heidelberg Tavern attack in that it </p>
<p class="line" id="line3031"><a name="pos3031"></a>is alleged that his vehicle was used in some way or the other.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3032"><a name="pos3032"></a>	(9) Des Segal died in a car crash early this year.  In the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3033"><a name="pos3033"></a>wreckage an R4 rifle, an RPG rocket launcher was found.  The press </p>
<p class="line" id="line3034"><a name="pos3034"></a>report talked about a possible link with the notorious Vlakplaas.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line3035"><a name="pos3035"></a>realise some two years have elapsed between these two events, but </p>
<p class="line" id="line3036"><a name="pos3036"></a>somehow I can only attack some sinister meaning to this.  The public </p>
<p class="line" id="line3037"><a name="pos3037"></a>have heard no more about Segal's R4 rifle, strangely it is the same </p>
<p class="line" id="line3038"><a name="pos3038"></a>type of weapon used in the Heidelberg Tavern incident.  My </p>
<p class="line" id="line3039"><a name="pos3039"></a>question is whether this weapon has been tested or checked to see </p>
<p class="line" id="line3040"><a name="pos3040"></a>whether it was the same one used at the Heidelberg Tavern.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line3041"><a name="pos3041"></a>appeal to the Amnesty Committee to urgently order an inquiry into </p>
<p class="line" id="line3042"><a name="pos3042"></a>the Des Segal affair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3043"><a name="pos3043"></a>	(10) As at the 30th December 1993, the murders at Heidelberg </p>
<p class="line" id="line3044"><a name="pos3044"></a>Tavern fell outside the time frame set for amnesty applications, yet </p>
<p class="line" id="line3045"><a name="pos3045"></a>it was decided to extend this cut off date.  My question is why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3046"><a name="pos3046"></a>	I have a perception that the real perpetrators of the most evil </p>
<p class="line" id="line3047"><a name="pos3047"></a>acts, are not going to be exposed and that the wrap will fall on the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3048"><a name="pos3048"></a>few hirelings who did their bidding.  People who by their own </p>
<p class="line" id="line3049"><a name="pos3049"></a>admission have committed gross violations of human rights and who </p>
<p class="line" id="line3050"><a name="pos3050"></a>are required simply to tell the truth, are assisted by high powered </p>
<p class="line" id="line3051"><a name="pos3051"></a>legal representatives in order to do so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3052"><a name="pos3052"></a>	In the majority of these cases, other than Heidelberg, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3053"><a name="pos3053"></a>funding of these lawyers is paid for by the very victims against who </p>
<p class="line" id="line3054"><a name="pos3054"></a>they apply for amnesty from criminal prosecution or civil liability.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3055"><a name="pos3055"></a>	I have lost two children to the system, my son to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3056"><a name="pos3056"></a>Apartheid system of justice and my daughter at the hands of killers </p>
<p class="line" id="line3057"><a name="pos3057"></a>that the system seems to protect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3058"><a name="pos3058"></a>	In an attempt to find out who politically was also guilty of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3059"><a name="pos3059"></a>acts of murder at Heidelberg Tavern, I approached members of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3060"><a name="pos3060"></a>PAC namely Ms De Lille, Barny Desai and Richard Zinani.  Ms De </p>
<p class="line" id="line3061"><a name="pos3061"></a>Lille told me that she had personally spoken to the applicants in this </p>
<p class="line" id="line3062"><a name="pos3062"></a>amnesty application and that they had steadfastly denied involvement </p>
<p class="line" id="line3063"><a name="pos3063"></a>in the killing.  I have noticed that the applications for amnesty of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3064"><a name="pos3064"></a>applicants say very little about the actual attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3065"><a name="pos3065"></a>	Gqomfa suggests that the attack was launched from outside </p>
<p class="line" id="line3066"><a name="pos3066"></a>the Tavern.  He does not suggest that anyone entered the premises </p>
<p class="line" id="line3067"><a name="pos3067"></a>and shot whilst inside.   Madasi and Mabala had given no details </p>
<p class="line" id="line3068"><a name="pos3068"></a>whatsoever.  I am forced to wonder why not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3069"><a name="pos3069"></a>	Is this a tactic?  Have they not yet decided what to say and </p>
<p class="line" id="line3070"><a name="pos3070"></a>who to implicate or will those details only be filled in after </p>
<p class="line" id="line3071"><a name="pos3071"></a>consultation with the hierarchy of the PAC or APLA?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3072"><a name="pos3072"></a>	I also wonder whose interest ought to safeguarded here.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line3073"><a name="pos3073"></a>urge this Committee that common sense and justice prevail in your </p>
<p class="line" id="line3074"><a name="pos3074"></a>assessment of the evidence and refuse amnesty.  I do not wish to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3075"><a name="pos3075"></a>dwell on my personal circumstances, however, I have been advised </p>
<p class="line" id="line3076"><a name="pos3076"></a>that such information is important to reveal to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3077"><a name="pos3077"></a>	The pain of losing my son was compounded a million times by </p>
<p class="line" id="line3078"><a name="pos3078"></a>the death of my daughter.  I felt responsible and guilty for both of </p>
<p class="line" id="line3079"><a name="pos3079"></a>them.  I have lived with that for the past four years.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3080"><a name="pos3080"></a>	My personality has changed.  I have not been able, despite </p>
<p class="line" id="line3081"><a name="pos3081"></a>extensive therapy and counselling at Valkenberg Hospital, to shed </p>
<p class="line" id="line3082"><a name="pos3082"></a>the anger, rage, guilt, feelings of revenge and helpless desperation at </p>
<p class="line" id="line3083"><a name="pos3083"></a>the system that allows murderers to escape punishment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3084"><a name="pos3084"></a>	Suffice to say my marriage has suffered irreparable harm.  My </p>
<p class="line" id="line3085"><a name="pos3085"></a>wife suffers from extreme anxiety and nervous tension.  We are both </p>
<p class="line" id="line3086"><a name="pos3086"></a>on constant medication.  I am not being able to forgive the killer of </p>
<p class="line" id="line3087"><a name="pos3087"></a>my daughter Rolanda, and cannot be a hypocrite and say so when my </p>
<p class="line" id="line3088"><a name="pos3088"></a>heart has feelings of murderous rage towards them and their </p>
<p class="line" id="line3089"><a name="pos3089"></a>masters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3090"><a name="pos3090"></a>	Finally, I challenge the leader of the PAC, Bishop Magoba, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3091"><a name="pos3091"></a>not to justify atrocities like Heidelberg Tavern with reference to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3092"><a name="pos3092"></a>similar atrocities perpetrated by the Apartheid regime, but to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3093"><a name="pos3093"></a>acknowledge it as a gross violation of the human rights of all those </p>
<p class="line" id="line3094"><a name="pos3094"></a>young people who were killed and maimed and to name all those </p>
<p class="line" id="line3095"><a name="pos3095"></a>who were involved in the authorization, planning and execution of </p>
<p class="line" id="line3096"><a name="pos3096"></a>the attack  so that the truth will be known.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3097"><a name="pos3097"></a>	This was dated at Cape Town on the 27th of October, that </p>
<p class="line" id="line3098"><a name="pos3098"></a>was Monday, 1997.  Mr Palm, you heard the statement read out on </p>
<p class="line" id="line3099"><a name="pos3099"></a>your behalf?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3100"><a name="pos3100"></a>MR PALM:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3101"><a name="pos3101"></a>MR PRIOR:   Do you confirm that statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3102"><a name="pos3102"></a>MR PALM:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3103"><a name="pos3103"></a>MR PRIOR:   Do you adhere to the contents of that statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3104"><a name="pos3104"></a>MR PALM:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3105"><a name="pos3105"></a>MR PRIOR:   Mr Chairman, I was also requested by Mr Palm there </p>
<p class="line" id="line3106"><a name="pos3106"></a>was a letter addressed to the TRC Committee by Mrs Palm and I </p>
<p class="line" id="line3107"><a name="pos3107"></a>have not opened it.  Her wish was to hand it to the Chairman, may I </p>
<p class="line" id="line3108"><a name="pos3108"></a>do so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3109"><a name="pos3109"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   I understand this is to the TRC Committee, not </p>
<p class="line" id="line3110"><a name="pos3110"></a>the Amnesty Committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3111"><a name="pos3111"></a>MR PRIOR:   I think in error she said the TRC Committee, I </p>
<p class="line" id="line3112"><a name="pos3112"></a>understand from Mr Palm ... (intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line3113"><a name="pos3113"></a>MR PALM:   She wanted the Chairman to read it out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3114"><a name="pos3114"></a>MR PRIOR:   Maybe you could elaborate, could you explain?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3115"><a name="pos3115"></a>MR PALM:   No, she said I must give it to the members of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3116"><a name="pos3116"></a>Committee and them to have it read out publicly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3117"><a name="pos3117"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   It is addressed to whom it may concern.  It is my </p>
<p class="line" id="line3118"><a name="pos3118"></a>understanding that during the struggle the main aim and objective </p>
<p class="line" id="line3119"><a name="pos3119"></a>was to free Mr Mandela and lead our people out of bondage to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3120"><a name="pos3120"></a>ensure a brighter future for all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3121"><a name="pos3121"></a>	On the 30th of December 1993, the struggle was supposedly </p>
<p class="line" id="line3122"><a name="pos3122"></a>over as Mr Mandela was free.  For my family and I, it brought </p>
<p class="line" id="line3123"><a name="pos3123"></a>nothing but sorrow and pain.  Bitterness and hatred eats away the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3124"><a name="pos3124"></a>soul, but our soul was destroyed the day APLA brutally murdered </p>
<p class="line" id="line3125"><a name="pos3125"></a>my daughter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3126"><a name="pos3126"></a>	I have nothing but contempt for these (indistinct) who now </p>
<p class="line" id="line3127"><a name="pos3127"></a>are enjoying the new South Africa, while others weep and mourn </p>
<p class="line" id="line3128"><a name="pos3128"></a>their loved ones.  These demons are now being integrated into our </p>
<p class="line" id="line3129"><a name="pos3129"></a>already corrupt Police Force.  What was wrong with Mr Mandela to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3130"><a name="pos3130"></a>allow these monsters to take over?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3131"><a name="pos3131"></a>	Surely they will kill their colleagues who are now forced to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3132"><a name="pos3132"></a>work with them, these power hungry, evil (indistinct), sworn by </p>
<p class="line" id="line3133"><a name="pos3133"></a>Satan himself, seek only to overthrow the Government as they claim. </p>
<p class="line" id="line3134"><a name="pos3134"></a> They are the Government in waiting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3135"><a name="pos3135"></a>	I hope the Commission keeps this in mind when granting </p>
<p class="line" id="line3136"><a name="pos3136"></a>amnesty to these wicket lost souls.  APLA's main goal in life is to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3137"><a name="pos3137"></a>seize power for themselves, they have shown the world that they </p>
<p class="line" id="line3138"><a name="pos3138"></a>have no regrets for their crimes and evil deeds.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3139"><a name="pos3139"></a>	They will kill again, that I can assure you.  The word APLA </p>
<p class="line" id="line3140"><a name="pos3140"></a>spells fear in the people's hearts and the leaders embrace this </p>
<p class="line" id="line3141"><a name="pos3141"></a>knowledge, that is why they say and do as they deem fit.  As for </p>
<p class="line" id="line3142"><a name="pos3142"></a>amnesty, whether I oppose it or not, they will definitely be freed to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3143"><a name="pos3143"></a>continue their devious work by repossession or whatever they can </p>
<p class="line" id="line3144"><a name="pos3144"></a>lay their filthy paws on, even if it does not belong to them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3145"><a name="pos3145"></a>	APLA have taken from us one of the most precious gifts the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3146"><a name="pos3146"></a>Lord can ever give us, my daughter was everything a mother, a </p>
<p class="line" id="line3147"><a name="pos3147"></a>father and brothers and sisters could ever want.  And the void her </p>
<p class="line" id="line3148"><a name="pos3148"></a>death has left us all, an and will never be filled again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3149"><a name="pos3149"></a>	I will never in all the time left to me, forgive anyone that had </p>
<p class="line" id="line3150"><a name="pos3150"></a>a hand in her death.  I ask God every day to understand and forgive </p>
<p class="line" id="line3151"><a name="pos3151"></a>me for feeling all this hatred and contempt that I have for her </p>
<p class="line" id="line3152"><a name="pos3152"></a>murderers.  My daughter was the type of person that would have </p>
<p class="line" id="line3153"><a name="pos3153"></a>wanted me to forgive these killers, as she believed in our Creator.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3154"><a name="pos3154"></a>	I would just like to thank the Commission for taking the time </p>
<p class="line" id="line3155"><a name="pos3155"></a>to read my letter and I will also like to ask the Commission if they </p>
<p class="line" id="line3156"><a name="pos3156"></a>could read this letter to the amnesty applicants because I would like </p>
<p class="line" id="line3157"><a name="pos3157"></a>them to know exactly how we feel.  Thanking you in anticipation, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3158"><a name="pos3158"></a>Mrs M.E. Palm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3159"><a name="pos3159"></a>MR PRIOR:   Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Palm, is there anything </p>
<p class="line" id="line3160"><a name="pos3160"></a>that you wish to add to your submissions?  Is there any further </p>
<p class="line" id="line3161"><a name="pos3161"></a>evidence you would like to give, or any statement you would like to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3162"><a name="pos3162"></a>make?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3163"><a name="pos3163"></a>MR PALM:   I think I have covered most of what I want to say.  But </p>
<p class="line" id="line3164"><a name="pos3164"></a>as everybody is talking about reparations, I would like to ask the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3165"><a name="pos3165"></a>Commission for reparations.  I am not looking for any monetary </p>
<p class="line" id="line3166"><a name="pos3166"></a>assistance, I would like, I appeal to the amnesty board to please </p>
<p class="line" id="line3167"><a name="pos3167"></a>look into my son's case and try and take these obstacles that is </p>
<p class="line" id="line3168"><a name="pos3168"></a>holding us back, to get at that truth first.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3169"><a name="pos3169"></a>MR PRIOR:   Is that all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3170"><a name="pos3170"></a>MR PALM:   Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3171"><a name="pos3171"></a>MR PRIOR:   Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3172"><a name="pos3172"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR PRIOR</p>
<p class="line" id="line3173"><a name="pos3173"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Arendse?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3174"><a name="pos3174"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   No questions, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3175"><a name="pos3175"></a>NO CROSS-EXAMINATION BY ADV ARENDSE</p>
<p class="line" id="line3176"><a name="pos3176"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Have you seen a plan of the Tavern?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3177"><a name="pos3177"></a>MR PALM:   I know if off by heart Your Honour.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3178"><a name="pos3178"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Could you indicate on that plan where you were </p>
<p class="line" id="line3179"><a name="pos3179"></a>seated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3180"><a name="pos3180"></a>MR PALM:   The arrow shows at point "b", but I was sitting more </p>
<p class="line" id="line3181"><a name="pos3181"></a>against the wall, just below the raised platform.  It is the very first </p>
<p class="line" id="line3182"><a name="pos3182"></a>table below that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3183"><a name="pos3183"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Was that the restaurant section?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3184"><a name="pos3184"></a>MR PALM:   That was the dining area, yes, which is directly </p>
<p class="line" id="line3185"><a name="pos3185"></a>virtually opposite the opening where the shooting came in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3186"><a name="pos3186"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   But you didn't see anybody?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3187"><a name="pos3187"></a>MR PALM:   No, as I explained to the Investigating Officers, there </p>
<p class="line" id="line3188"><a name="pos3188"></a>is a column and whoever did the shooting, was behind that column </p>
<p class="line" id="line3189"><a name="pos3189"></a>so I didn't see a figure.  All, when I realised that the shooting was </p>
<p class="line" id="line3190"><a name="pos3190"></a>going on, it was just the sound, splinters, things breaking and the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3191"><a name="pos3191"></a>smoke rising and that is the time I tried to get my daughter out of </p>
<p class="line" id="line3192"><a name="pos3192"></a>the way and pulled her down to the floor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3193"><a name="pos3193"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3194"><a name="pos3194"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Palm, thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3195"><a name="pos3195"></a>CROSS-EXAMINATION BY ADV ARENDSE:	Sorry Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line3196"><a name="pos3196"></a>Chairman, just one question.  Mr Palm, you said on page 35 of your </p>
<p class="line" id="line3197"><a name="pos3197"></a>statement that Mr Prior read, the second paragraph, while you were </p>
<p class="line" id="line3198"><a name="pos3198"></a>sitting and talking, I glanced up over her shoulder to where the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3199"><a name="pos3199"></a>sound was coming from, I noticed sparks, smoke, glasses breaking </p>
<p class="line" id="line3200"><a name="pos3200"></a>and I realised this was because someone was shooting into the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3201"><a name="pos3201"></a>Tavern.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3202"><a name="pos3202"></a>MR PALM:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3203"><a name="pos3203"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Now, where you were sitting at - you referred to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3204"><a name="pos3204"></a>the end of that line there that shows "b".</p>
<p class="line" id="line3205"><a name="pos3205"></a>MR PALM:   Yes, it was the first table below the raised platform.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line3206"><a name="pos3206"></a>The very first table, I had my back towards the wall facing the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3207"><a name="pos3207"></a>opening and her back was towards that opening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3208"><a name="pos3208"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Now, when you say the  shooting was into the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3209"><a name="pos3209"></a>Tavern, was that shooting coming through the windows, through the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3210"><a name="pos3210"></a>door?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3211"><a name="pos3211"></a>MR PALM:   Well, I can't say I note the shooting through the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3212"><a name="pos3212"></a>windows, but that shooting sort of seemed to be directed down the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3213"><a name="pos3213"></a>passage way into the bar, because as I said it narrows there by the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3214"><a name="pos3214"></a>step, the stairway and there is a bar area beyond that, it was sort of </p>
<p class="line" id="line3215"><a name="pos3215"></a>directed into that direction which gave me the edge to get out of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3216"><a name="pos3216"></a>way in time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3217"><a name="pos3217"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   You seem from the marking that I have made and </p>
<p class="line" id="line3218"><a name="pos3218"></a>I could be wrong, you seem to be sitting closer to the double doors </p>
<p class="line" id="line3219"><a name="pos3219"></a>than to the stairway?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3220"><a name="pos3220"></a>MR PALM:   That is correct, the stairway is actually beyond the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3221"><a name="pos3221"></a>point.  I wouldn't be able to see the stairway from where I was </p>
<p class="line" id="line3222"><a name="pos3222"></a>sitting, because there is also another column just in front and there </p>
<p class="line" id="line3223"><a name="pos3223"></a>is a telephone on that corner.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3224"><a name="pos3224"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   So how far, can you remember how far you were </p>
<p class="line" id="line3225"><a name="pos3225"></a>sitting from the double doors?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3226"><a name="pos3226"></a>MR PALM:   Which double door are you talking about, the one on </p>
<p class="line" id="line3227"><a name="pos3227"></a>the road side or are you talking about the entrance?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3228"><a name="pos3228"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Yes, from the road side, maybe the best thing is </p>
<p class="line" id="line3229"><a name="pos3229"></a>if you look at where "g" and "f" is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3230"><a name="pos3230"></a>MR PALM:   Yes, I was sitting quite close to that.  Well, it was </p>
<p class="line" id="line3231"><a name="pos3231"></a>quite near.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3232"><a name="pos3232"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   When you say near, can you maybe just indicate </p>
<p class="line" id="line3233"><a name="pos3233"></a>or can you say two metres, three metres, four metres, five metres?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3234"><a name="pos3234"></a>MR PALM:   I would estimate about four metres.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3235"><a name="pos3235"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Four metres?   Thank you Mr Palm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3236"><a name="pos3236"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY ADV ARENDSE.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3237"><a name="pos3237"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Palm, thank you.  You are excused from </p>

<p class="line" id="line3258"><a name="pos3258"></a>when the incident in question took place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3259"><a name="pos3259"></a>	The restaurant had been quite full that evening, being the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3260"><a name="pos3260"></a>festive season and everyone was in a jolly mood.  After the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3261"><a name="pos3261"></a>restaurant had closed, the owner Joe Cerqueira, his brother and </p>
<p class="line" id="line3262"><a name="pos3262"></a>another colleague whose name I can't remember, had been clearing </p>
<p class="line" id="line3263"><a name="pos3263"></a>the restaurant and set about preparing the restaurant for the next </p>
<p class="line" id="line3264"><a name="pos3264"></a>day's business.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3265"><a name="pos3265"></a>	When we heard what we assumed was a car backfiring in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3266"><a name="pos3266"></a>road outside, the sound continued and we thought that it may also </p>
<p class="line" id="line3267"><a name="pos3267"></a>be the sound of fireworks thrown by some partygoers outside.  I was </p>
<p class="line" id="line3268"><a name="pos3268"></a>the first to walk out of the restaurant to investigate and was </p>
<p class="line" id="line3269"><a name="pos3269"></a>followed by my colleagues.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3270"><a name="pos3270"></a>	I saw individuals coming out of the Heidelberg Tavern, which </p>
<p class="line" id="line3271"><a name="pos3271"></a>is located next to Machados restaurant.  They were making their way </p>
<p class="line" id="line3272"><a name="pos3272"></a>to a dark coloured car.  I saw what again I thought was flares or </p>
<p class="line" id="line3273"><a name="pos3273"></a>fireworks and then noticed these individuals were firing automatic </p>
<p class="line" id="line3274"><a name="pos3274"></a>machine gun fire in all directions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3275"><a name="pos3275"></a>	Once they spotted me and my colleagues, they fired in our </p>
<p class="line" id="line3276"><a name="pos3276"></a>direction.  In the resulting confusion, we pushed our way back into </p>
<p class="line" id="line3277"><a name="pos3277"></a>the restaurant and took cover as best we could.  I remember lying </p>
<p class="line" id="line3278"><a name="pos3278"></a>flat on the floor of the restaurant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3279"><a name="pos3279"></a>	Once the firing had stopped, I ran out of the restaurant.  It </p>
<p class="line" id="line3280"><a name="pos3280"></a>was at this stage I saw the deceased, Joe Cerqueira lying, dying in </p>
<p class="line" id="line3281"><a name="pos3281"></a>the gutter, he had been shot in the chest.  The result was complete </p>
<p class="line" id="line3282"><a name="pos3282"></a>mayhem as people ran around in shock, shouting for help.  It was </p>
<p class="line" id="line3283"><a name="pos3283"></a>only at this stage, when I knelt down next to the deceased that I </p>
<p class="line" id="line3284"><a name="pos3284"></a>realised that I had been shot in the leg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3285"><a name="pos3285"></a>	My thoughts at that stage were about Joe Cerqueira and I </p>
<p class="line" id="line3286"><a name="pos3286"></a>remember thinking Joe, you can't die now.  The exact details of what </p>
<p class="line" id="line3287"><a name="pos3287"></a>happened after that are not clear to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3288"><a name="pos3288"></a>	4.  The effect of the incident.  A month after the shooting, my </p>
<p class="line" id="line3289"><a name="pos3289"></a>life had fallen to pieces.  I withdrew totally from the day to day </p>
<p class="line" id="line3290"><a name="pos3290"></a>activities of life.  Interests that I once had such as mountain </p>
<p class="line" id="line3291"><a name="pos3291"></a>climbing were now of no importance to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3292"><a name="pos3292"></a>	I withdrew from all sporting activities that I had been </p>
<p class="line" id="line3293"><a name="pos3293"></a>involved in.  I began drinking alcohol heavily, suffered insomnia and </p>
<p class="line" id="line3294"><a name="pos3294"></a>a lack of concentration of things going on around me.  The most </p>
<p class="line" id="line3295"><a name="pos3295"></a>traumatic effect that this had on me, has been the loss of contact </p>
<p class="line" id="line3296"><a name="pos3296"></a>with those closest to me, my family.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3297"><a name="pos3297"></a>	I was referred to professional help to the psychology </p>
<p class="line" id="line3298"><a name="pos3298"></a>department of Groote Schuur Hospital.  I also saw a psychiatrist at </p>
<p class="line" id="line3299"><a name="pos3299"></a>the hospital, who diagnosed me as suffering from post traumatic </p>
<p class="line" id="line3300"><a name="pos3300"></a>stress and was placed on medication for one year.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3301"><a name="pos3301"></a>	After the incident I applied for a job at the Crab Shack </p>
<p class="line" id="line3302"><a name="pos3302"></a>restaurant in Milnerton.  During my first shift deliveries were being </p>
<p class="line" id="line3303"><a name="pos3303"></a>made to the restaurant via the back entrance.  I was unaware of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3304"><a name="pos3304"></a>delivery and when I saw the black gentleman walking into the back </p>
<p class="line" id="line3305"><a name="pos3305"></a>entrance, I thought this could also be an attack on the restaurant.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line3306"><a name="pos3306"></a>broke in a sweat and had a panic attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3307"><a name="pos3307"></a>	Resulting in the fact that I broke down and was unable to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3308"><a name="pos3308"></a>continue working at the restaurant.  I never returned to this </p>
<p class="line" id="line3309"><a name="pos3309"></a>restaurant, the realisation as how quickly one's life can be taken </p>
<p class="line" id="line3310"><a name="pos3310"></a>became a nightmare for me.  Joe's death had effected me adversely </p>
<p class="line" id="line3311"><a name="pos3311"></a>and as I feel I have become a total nervous wreck.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3312"><a name="pos3312"></a>	I was once again referred to the out-patient department of </p>
<p class="line" id="line3313"><a name="pos3313"></a>Groote Schuur Hospital and also to the welfare department, who </p>
<p class="line" id="line3314"><a name="pos3314"></a>after consulting with me, applied for disability family grant.  It was </p>
<p class="line" id="line3315"><a name="pos3315"></a>also recommended that I attend Valkenberg Hospital for further </p>
<p class="line" id="line3316"><a name="pos3316"></a>observation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3317"><a name="pos3317"></a>	Because of the connectation attached to Valkenberg Hospital, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3318"><a name="pos3318"></a>I refused and stayed away.  I feel as if I have become a monster.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line3319"><a name="pos3319"></a>feel distanced from my family and unable to guide them as leader of </p>
<p class="line" id="line3320"><a name="pos3320"></a>the household.  My life seems to be a constant see saw in that I feel </p>
<p class="line" id="line3321"><a name="pos3321"></a>up one day, and down the next.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3322"><a name="pos3322"></a>	I feel as if my manhood has been taken away from me.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line3323"><a name="pos3323"></a>seldom feel as if I would be able to be a normal person again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3324"><a name="pos3324"></a>	My view regarding the amnesty application.   If this had been </p>
<p class="line" id="line3325"><a name="pos3325"></a>an accident, I could find it in my heart to forgive the applicants.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line3326"><a name="pos3326"></a>This was purely a terrorist attack for which the applicants had </p>
<p class="line" id="line3327"><a name="pos3327"></a>willingly trained and executed their orders.  And they too, like those </p>
<p class="line" id="line3328"><a name="pos3328"></a>of us who have suffered the trauma because of this incident, should </p>
<p class="line" id="line3329"><a name="pos3329"></a>pay the price.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3330"><a name="pos3330"></a>	I am sure they were reimbursed by their employers, something </p>
<p class="line" id="line3331"><a name="pos3331"></a>that we have not been.  I therefore oppose the application for </p>
<p class="line" id="line3332"><a name="pos3332"></a>amnesty for these individuals. </p>
<p class="line" id="line3333"><a name="pos3333"></a>	How I see the future.  The future seems bleak for me and my </p>
<p class="line" id="line3334"><a name="pos3334"></a>family as I have been unable to hold down a permanent job.  The </p>
<p class="line" id="line3335"><a name="pos3335"></a>inability to be the leader of my family, has been debilitating to say </p>
<p class="line" id="line3336"><a name="pos3336"></a>the least and I really fear for the future of my children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3337"><a name="pos3337"></a>	Reparation and compensation.  I feel that what has been taken </p>
<p class="line" id="line3338"><a name="pos3338"></a>away from me and my family, should be compensated for and I </p>
<p class="line" id="line3339"><a name="pos3339"></a>would appreciate the Reparation Committee to look into this.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line3340"><a name="pos3340"></a>Signed at Cape Town, the 22nd of October 1997.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3341"><a name="pos3341"></a>	Do you confirm that statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3342"><a name="pos3342"></a>MR BRODE:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3343"><a name="pos3343"></a>MR PRIOR:   Do you adhere to its contents?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3344"><a name="pos3344"></a>MR BRODE:   I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3345"><a name="pos3345"></a>MR PRIOR:   I want to ask you a few questions regarding the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3346"><a name="pos3346"></a>incident.  You were present at the hearing when Mr Cerqueira, Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line3347"><a name="pos3347"></a>Francisco Cerqueira gave evidence regarding the incident, is that </p>
<p class="line" id="line3348"><a name="pos3348"></a>correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3349"><a name="pos3349"></a>MR BRODE:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3350"><a name="pos3350"></a>MR PRIOR:   He mentioned in his evidence that you at some stage, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3351"><a name="pos3351"></a>after the shooting, brought the firearm, a firearm which had </p>
<p class="line" id="line3352"><a name="pos3352"></a>belonged to Mr Cerqueira the deceased, to him.  Did you hear that </p>
<p class="line" id="line3353"><a name="pos3353"></a>evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3354"><a name="pos3354"></a>MR BRODE:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3355"><a name="pos3355"></a>MR PRIOR:   Could you explain to the Committee the circumstances </p>
<p class="line" id="line3356"><a name="pos3356"></a>surrounding that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3357"><a name="pos3357"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Where did you find the firearm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3358"><a name="pos3358"></a>MR BRODE:   I can't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3359"><a name="pos3359"></a>MR PRIOR:   What do you remember of the incident?  You </p>
<p class="line" id="line3360"><a name="pos3360"></a>mentioned about the shooting and that you ran inside the restaurant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3361"><a name="pos3361"></a>MR BRODE:   Yes, that is correct yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3362"><a name="pos3362"></a>MR PRIOR:   Where was Mr Cerqueira deceased, Joe Cerqueira, at </p>
<p class="line" id="line3363"><a name="pos3363"></a>the time when you ran back, moved back into the restaurant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3364"><a name="pos3364"></a>MR BRODE:   When I went back into the restaurant, and I shouted </p>
<p class="line" id="line3365"><a name="pos3365"></a>for Joe ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line3366"><a name="pos3366"></a>MR PRIOR:   Did you know where he was, did you see him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3367"><a name="pos3367"></a>MR BRODE:   No, the last that I can remember is that he was at the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3368"><a name="pos3368"></a>back of the restaurant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3369"><a name="pos3369"></a>MR PRIOR:   Can you remember what you did after the shots were </p>
<p class="line" id="line3370"><a name="pos3370"></a>fired?  The initial shots, when you were out on the street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3371"><a name="pos3371"></a>MR BRODE:   I was out on the street.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line3372"><a name="pos3372"></a>MR PRIOR:   When you were on the pavement and you said they </p>
<p class="line" id="line3373"><a name="pos3373"></a>were shooting at you, you then turned and moved back into the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3374"><a name="pos3374"></a>restaurant, you ran in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3375"><a name="pos3375"></a>MR BRODE:   Yes, that is correct yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3376"><a name="pos3376"></a>MR PRIOR:   What did you then do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3377"><a name="pos3377"></a>MR BRODE:   I ran into the restaurant, you know it was a complete </p>
<p class="line" id="line3378"><a name="pos3378"></a>confusion at the door.  I know that Frans went into the restaurant </p>
<p class="line" id="line3379"><a name="pos3379"></a>and there was three of us.  We went back into the restaurant, I </p>
<p class="line" id="line3380"><a name="pos3380"></a>didn't see Joe anywhere.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3381"><a name="pos3381"></a>MR PRIOR:   When was the first time to see him after the shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3382"><a name="pos3382"></a>MR BRODE:   After the shooting, the first time I saw him was when </p>
<p class="line" id="line3383"><a name="pos3383"></a>we came out and he was lying outside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3384"><a name="pos3384"></a>MR PRIOR:   Did you see a firearm next to the body?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3385"><a name="pos3385"></a>MR BRODE:   No, I didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3386"><a name="pos3386"></a>MR PRIOR:   Can you remember, and you indicated to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3387"><a name="pos3387"></a>Committee you don't remember where you picked the firearm up </p>
<p class="line" id="line3388"><a name="pos3388"></a>from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3389"><a name="pos3389"></a>MR BRODE:   I've got no recollection of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3390"><a name="pos3390"></a>MR PRIOR:   Did you receive any medical treatment at the scene?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3391"><a name="pos3391"></a>MR BRODE:   Yes, they said they were going to take me up to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3392"><a name="pos3392"></a>hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3393"><a name="pos3393"></a>MR PRIOR:   Did you receive no injections or medication?  Can you </p>
<p class="line" id="line3394"><a name="pos3394"></a>remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3395"><a name="pos3395"></a>MR BRODE:   I think, yes they led me to an ambulance and they </p>
<p class="line" id="line3396"><a name="pos3396"></a>gave me an injection.  They gave me something to calm me, I think, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3397"><a name="pos3397"></a>yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3398"><a name="pos3398"></a>MR PRIOR:   Do you have any difficulty recalling the events of that </p>
<p class="line" id="line3399"><a name="pos3399"></a>evening?  You seem to have ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line3400"><a name="pos3400"></a>MR BRODE:   Yes, there are things that I can remember, but just </p>
<p class="line" id="line3401"><a name="pos3401"></a>after the shooting, there is big gaps, you know, I can't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3402"><a name="pos3402"></a>MR PRIOR:   Is there anything else you wish to tell the Committee </p>
<p class="line" id="line3403"><a name="pos3403"></a>regarding the application for amnesty?  You said you had some </p>
<p class="line" id="line3404"><a name="pos3404"></a>statement or further points?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3405"><a name="pos3405"></a>MR BRODE:   Yes, well this is just something that I would like Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line3406"><a name="pos3406"></a>Prior to read for me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3407"><a name="pos3407"></a>MR PRIOR:   Is that possible Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3408"><a name="pos3408"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, assist him.  Is this something which you </p>
<p class="line" id="line3409"><a name="pos3409"></a>have written out yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3410"><a name="pos3410"></a>MR BRODE:   This is something that someone had written out for </p>
<p class="line" id="line3411"><a name="pos3411"></a>me, that I have expressed over to him and he has put it in writing for </p>
<p class="line" id="line3412"><a name="pos3412"></a>me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3413"><a name="pos3413"></a>MR PRIOR:   Mr Chairman, to balance properly the interest of </p>
<p class="line" id="line3414"><a name="pos3414"></a>society with those of the applicants, and to reflect such balance in a </p>
<p class="line" id="line3415"><a name="pos3415"></a>verdict that is both just to society and just to the applicants so often </p>
<p class="line" id="line3416"><a name="pos3416"></a>calls for deep insight and for the wisdom of a Solomon - qualities </p>
<p class="line" id="line3417"><a name="pos3417"></a>with which we are blessed in some small measure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3418"><a name="pos3418"></a>	One must look carefully at the offender and try to understand </p>
<p class="line" id="line3419"><a name="pos3419"></a>his background and what moved him to act as he did in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3420"><a name="pos3420"></a>particular situation in which he found himself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3421"><a name="pos3421"></a>	Then the demands of society have to be considered.  This </p>
<p class="line" id="line3422"><a name="pos3422"></a>includes the need to express appropriate disapproval of what was </p>
<p class="line" id="line3423"><a name="pos3423"></a>done as well as the need to deter both the offender and others from </p>
<p class="line" id="line3424"><a name="pos3424"></a>committing crime.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3425"><a name="pos3425"></a>	The rehabilitation of the offender is also in a suitable case, a </p>
<p class="line" id="line3426"><a name="pos3426"></a>fact to be weighed.  The crime in this case is particularly horrifying. </p>
<p class="line" id="line3427"><a name="pos3427"></a> And it is difficult to think of a more terrible crime than of innocent </p>
<p class="line" id="line3428"><a name="pos3428"></a>young people being killed in such an attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3429"><a name="pos3429"></a>	The way in which these young people were done to death, was </p>
<p class="line" id="line3430"><a name="pos3430"></a>heartless and cruel.  The cover up operation which followed, was </p>
<p class="line" id="line3431"><a name="pos3431"></a>cunning and evidence of coldness and deliberateness about the whole </p>
<p class="line" id="line3432"><a name="pos3432"></a>operation which I found disturbing when such relatively young </p>
<p class="line" id="line3433"><a name="pos3433"></a>people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3434"><a name="pos3434"></a>	The crime is heinous.  It is clear from the evidence that all the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3435"><a name="pos3435"></a>accused were very much under the influence of the military high </p>
<p class="line" id="line3436"><a name="pos3436"></a>command under which they trained.  Yet having said all that, it is </p>
<p class="line" id="line3437"><a name="pos3437"></a>nevertheless clear that they embarked on this evil course of their </p>
<p class="line" id="line3438"><a name="pos3438"></a>own free choice.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3439"><a name="pos3439"></a>	We have not been told the full truth of the applicants, it </p>
<p class="line" id="line3440"><a name="pos3440"></a>remains difficult for me to find reconciliation in my heart.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line3441"><a name="pos3441"></a>	Is that what you wanted me to read out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3442"><a name="pos3442"></a>MR BRODE:   Thank you, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3443"><a name="pos3443"></a>MR PRIOR:   It is available Mr Chairman.  Is there anything else </p>
<p class="line" id="line3444"><a name="pos3444"></a>that you wish to bring to the attention of the Committee?  Is there </p>
<p class="line" id="line3445"><a name="pos3445"></a>anything else in this matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3446"><a name="pos3446"></a>MR BRODE:   No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3447"><a name="pos3447"></a>MR PRIOR:   Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3448"><a name="pos3448"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR PRIOR</p>
<p class="line" id="line3449"><a name="pos3449"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Arendse?</p>

<p class="line" id="line3451"><a name="pos3451"></a>Brode, let me tell you that on, I speak for myself and my colleagues </p>
<p class="line" id="line3452"><a name="pos3452"></a>here, that we feel for you and for the other victims about what </p>
<p class="line" id="line3453"><a name="pos3453"></a>happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3454"><a name="pos3454"></a>	Indeed, there is none of us sitting at this table, who haven't </p>
<p class="line" id="line3455"><a name="pos3455"></a>experienced the kind of experiences that you are going through, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3456"><a name="pos3456"></a>personal and friends and relatives, tortured, maimed, killed, by the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3457"><a name="pos3457"></a>State, so it is not that we don't appreciate your suffering at this </p>
<p class="line" id="line3458"><a name="pos3458"></a>moment.  But I've got to ask you a few questions, you appreciate </p>
<p class="line" id="line3459"><a name="pos3459"></a>that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3460"><a name="pos3460"></a>MR BRODE:   Not really, but go ahead.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3461"><a name="pos3461"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Not really?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3462"><a name="pos3462"></a>MR BRODE:   No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3463"><a name="pos3463"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Okay, is it important for you that we must get as </p>
<p class="line" id="line3464"><a name="pos3464"></a>complete or as full a picture as possible about what happened there </p>
<p class="line" id="line3465"><a name="pos3465"></a>that night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3466"><a name="pos3466"></a>MR BRODE:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3467"><a name="pos3467"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Are you prepared to help me to establish that </p>
<p class="line" id="line3468"><a name="pos3468"></a>picture, knowing that I have mentioned you have been here this </p>
<p class="line" id="line3469"><a name="pos3469"></a>whole week, that I am not here to defend the indefensible, that I </p>
<p class="line" id="line3470"><a name="pos3470"></a>agree with you that it was a heinous crime?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3471"><a name="pos3471"></a>MR BRODE:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3472"><a name="pos3472"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   I just want to actually deal with one aspect </p>
<p class="line" id="line3473"><a name="pos3473"></a>which is an important aspect.   And that aspect relates to whether or </p>
<p class="line" id="line3474"><a name="pos3474"></a>not you know or whether you can't tell us with any certainty, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3475"><a name="pos3475"></a>whether or not Mr Jose Cerqueira used a firearm that evening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3476"><a name="pos3476"></a>MR BRODE:   Just repeat the question please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3477"><a name="pos3477"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Can you just tell us whether you can remember </p>
<p class="line" id="line3478"><a name="pos3478"></a>whether or not Mr Cerqueira used a firearm that evening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3479"><a name="pos3479"></a>MR BRODE:   Not to my knowledge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3480"><a name="pos3480"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Can't you say or are you certain that he did not? </p>
<p class="line" id="line3481"><a name="pos3481"></a> Let me put it another way, is it possible that he may have used a </p>
<p class="line" id="line3482"><a name="pos3482"></a>firearm without you knowing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3483"><a name="pos3483"></a>MR BRODE:   No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3484"><a name="pos3484"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Why are you so certain?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3485"><a name="pos3485"></a>MR BRODE:   Because when I went out of the restaurant, I didn't </p>
<p class="line" id="line3486"><a name="pos3486"></a>see Joe outside the restaurant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3487"><a name="pos3487"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Isn't the reason why when you went outside, he </p>
<p class="line" id="line3488"><a name="pos3488"></a>had already gone outside and had gone just a little way to the right </p>
<p class="line" id="line3489"><a name="pos3489"></a>of the door where you had come out with Frans and with the other </p>
<p class="line" id="line3490"><a name="pos3490"></a>waiter, isn't that the reason why you never saw him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3491"><a name="pos3491"></a>MR BRODE:   No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3492"><a name="pos3492"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   How can you be so certain?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3493"><a name="pos3493"></a>MR BRODE:   Because when we heard shots, I was the first one to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3494"><a name="pos3494"></a>leave the restaurant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3495"><a name="pos3495"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Were you the first one, was Frans not the first </p>
<p class="line" id="line3496"><a name="pos3496"></a>one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3497"><a name="pos3497"></a>MR BRODE:   No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3498"><a name="pos3498"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Okay, let me ask you why - you say you can't </p>
<p class="line" id="line3499"><a name="pos3499"></a>remember where you found the firearm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3500"><a name="pos3500"></a>MR BRODE:   No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3501"><a name="pos3501"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Why is the firearm in issue?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3502"><a name="pos3502"></a>MR BRODE:   It wasn't an issue to me.  As you can see from my </p>
<p class="line" id="line3503"><a name="pos3503"></a>first and my second statement, I didn't mention that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3504"><a name="pos3504"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   You gave evidence in court?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3505"><a name="pos3505"></a>MR BRODE:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3506"><a name="pos3506"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   And you mentioned the firearm in court.  Can </p>
<p class="line" id="line3507"><a name="pos3507"></a>you remember mentioning the firearm in court?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3508"><a name="pos3508"></a>MR BRODE:   No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3509"><a name="pos3509"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Okay.  You appear to have mentioned it in court. </p>
<p class="line" id="line3510"><a name="pos3510"></a> The Judge, on page 47 of the record, mentions that you in </p>
<p class="line" id="line3511"><a name="pos3511"></a>Afrikaans you called at Cerqueira for his firearm, which he kept </p>
<p class="line" id="line3512"><a name="pos3512"></a>behind the counter.  Can you recall saying something like that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3513"><a name="pos3513"></a>MR BRODE:   Yes, that I do recall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3514"><a name="pos3514"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   So you did mention a firearm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3515"><a name="pos3515"></a>MR BRODE:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3516"><a name="pos3516"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Why did you call to Mr Cerqueira for his </p>
<p class="line" id="line3517"><a name="pos3517"></a>firearm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3518"><a name="pos3518"></a>MR BRODE:   I called to Mr Cerqueira to get his firearm, because </p>
<p class="line" id="line3519"><a name="pos3519"></a>we were attacked and that is you know, while I was running back </p>
<p class="line" id="line3520"><a name="pos3520"></a>into the restaurant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3521"><a name="pos3521"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Isn't it possible then that he heard the cracking </p>
<p class="line" id="line3522"><a name="pos3522"></a>sound or the sounds emanating from the Tavern, that he took his </p>
<p class="line" id="line3523"><a name="pos3523"></a>firearm and ran outside before you even got outside.  Isn't that </p>
<p class="line" id="line3524"><a name="pos3524"></a>possible?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3525"><a name="pos3525"></a>MR BRODE:   No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3526"><a name="pos3526"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Now if the, you are certain about that, or you </p>
<p class="line" id="line3527"><a name="pos3527"></a>appear to be certain.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3528"><a name="pos3528"></a>MR BRODE:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3529"><a name="pos3529"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Why did the firearm feature?  Why did you - did </p>
<p class="line" id="line3530"><a name="pos3530"></a>you hand the firearm to Frans or did you hand it to the Police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3531"><a name="pos3531"></a>MR BRODE:   I can't remember that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3532"><a name="pos3532"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Mr Frans Cerqueira says that you handed him the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3533"><a name="pos3533"></a>firearm and he handed it in turn to the Police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3534"><a name="pos3534"></a>MR BRODE:   That could have been a possibility.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3535"><a name="pos3535"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   So why did you hand him the firearm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3536"><a name="pos3536"></a>MR BRODE:   I can't answer that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3537"><a name="pos3537"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Because at that point, and Mr Frans Cerqueira </p>
<p class="line" id="line3538"><a name="pos3538"></a>says it was about ten minutes or so, I speak under correction, it was </p>
<p class="line" id="line3539"><a name="pos3539"></a>about ten minutes or so after he had picked up his brother, after he </p>
<p class="line" id="line3540"><a name="pos3540"></a>had been shot.  So, and you were in quite a state, so was Mr Frans </p>
<p class="line" id="line3541"><a name="pos3541"></a>Cerqueira, is that not right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3542"><a name="pos3542"></a>MR BRODE:   That is right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3543"><a name="pos3543"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   So, we are trying to establish here for what </p>
<p class="line" id="line3544"><a name="pos3544"></a>reason would you give a firearm to him, to give to the Police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3545"><a name="pos3545"></a>MR BRODE:   There is the possibility that when I went back into </p>
<p class="line" id="line3546"><a name="pos3546"></a>the restaurant, during the shooting, calling out for Joe, calling out </p>
<p class="line" id="line3547"><a name="pos3547"></a>for the gun, that after everything had you know, when we went out </p>
<p class="line" id="line3548"><a name="pos3548"></a>the second time and - well, I will start again.  There is the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3549"><a name="pos3549"></a>possibility that when I went out, when I came back into the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3550"><a name="pos3550"></a>restaurant the first time and called out for Joe and the gun, that </p>
<p class="line" id="line3551"><a name="pos3551"></a>when this was all over and after seeing Joe lying there, getting up, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3552"><a name="pos3552"></a>going inside, I know that I did contact my parents, there is the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3553"><a name="pos3553"></a>possibility that the gun could have been underneath the counter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3554"><a name="pos3554"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   You don't have a definite recollection of that, is </p>
<p class="line" id="line3555"><a name="pos3555"></a>that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3556"><a name="pos3556"></a>MR BRODE:   Under oath ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line3557"><a name="pos3557"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   You don't have a definite recollection of that, do </p>
<p class="line" id="line3558"><a name="pos3558"></a>you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3559"><a name="pos3559"></a>MR BRODE:   I have no definite recollection of how I got the gun </p>
<p class="line" id="line3560"><a name="pos3560"></a>in my hand to give it to Frans Cerqueira.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3561"><a name="pos3561"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   I want to suggest to you another possibility Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line3562"><a name="pos3562"></a>Brode, and that is the possibility that Mr Cerqueira could have taken </p>
<p class="line" id="line3563"><a name="pos3563"></a>the gun, he reacted, he took his gun, he ran outside.  If you look at </p>
<p class="line" id="line3564"><a name="pos3564"></a>photograph 22, he had run outside, turned right, was in the vicinity </p>
<p class="line" id="line3565"><a name="pos3565"></a>of the drain you see there and fired a shot or shots with his gun at </p>
<p class="line" id="line3566"><a name="pos3566"></a>the attackers as they were approaching.  At that same moment or </p>
<p class="line" id="line3567"><a name="pos3567"></a>more or less at the same moment, you and Frans and the other </p>
<p class="line" id="line3568"><a name="pos3568"></a>waiter, came out of the Machados, the shots were then also coming </p>
<p class="line" id="line3569"><a name="pos3569"></a>in your direction, the car was by that stage already passed the door </p>
<p class="line" id="line3570"><a name="pos3570"></a>of Machados and hence you see those marks on the inside of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3571"><a name="pos3571"></a>entrance to Machados, and that is when you took cover and ran back </p>
<p class="line" id="line3572"><a name="pos3572"></a>inside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3573"><a name="pos3573"></a>MR BRODE:   And that is your suggestion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3574"><a name="pos3574"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   That is what I am suggesting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3575"><a name="pos3575"></a>MR BRODE:   That is your suggestion, could I make a suggestion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3576"><a name="pos3576"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3577"><a name="pos3577"></a>MR BRODE:   Okay, my suggestion is okay the facts are that I left </p>
<p class="line" id="line3578"><a name="pos3578"></a>the restaurant first, followed by my colleagues.  And you kept </p>
<p class="line" id="line3579"><a name="pos3579"></a>stressing the point that I didn't mention anything about Frans and </p>
<p class="line" id="line3580"><a name="pos3580"></a>one thing and another, I want to try and control myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3581"><a name="pos3581"></a>	My suggestion is we heard the shots, Joe was not in the front </p>
<p class="line" id="line3582"><a name="pos3582"></a>of the restaurant, I am talking about the front area of the restaurant, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3583"><a name="pos3583"></a>not near the front, just the front area of the restaurant, he was not </p>
<p class="line" id="line3584"><a name="pos3584"></a>there, he was not there, he was at the back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3585"><a name="pos3585"></a>	He was at the far end of the restaurant, not in the front end of </p>
<p class="line" id="line3586"><a name="pos3586"></a>the restaurant.  We heard the shots, I went out.  Right, when I went </p>
<p class="line" id="line3587"><a name="pos3587"></a>out, I saw guys coming out of the Tavern next door and as they </p>
<p class="line" id="line3588"><a name="pos3588"></a>were coming out, getting into their cars, they were shooting, but to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3589"><a name="pos3589"></a>me it was like as if they were just ushered out, you know because </p>
<p class="line" id="line3590"><a name="pos3590"></a>they were causing disturbance there and they were just told to leave, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3591"><a name="pos3591"></a>that is the way I saw it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3592"><a name="pos3592"></a>	Right, they got into the car, the car was moving towards us, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3593"><a name="pos3593"></a>the lights were still off.  Still shooting, still firing away, blindly, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3594"><a name="pos3594"></a>then suddenly they fired at us.  I felt a push from the back, you </p>
<p class="line" id="line3595"><a name="pos3595"></a>know, that is when I turned to run in.  And at no stage, at no stage, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3596"><a name="pos3596"></a>I will stress at no stage, was Joe Cerqueira outside there with us.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line3597"><a name="pos3597"></a>He was not lying in that gutter, there at that yellow pole in front of </p>
<p class="line" id="line3598"><a name="pos3598"></a>us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3599"><a name="pos3599"></a>	My suggestion is there is a possibility that when we turned to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3600"><a name="pos3600"></a>run back inside, in the confusion there at the door, we running </p>
<p class="line" id="line3601"><a name="pos3601"></a>inside, no one verbally said Joe, duck, someone is shooting, no one </p>
<p class="line" id="line3602"><a name="pos3602"></a>said nothing, I can't remember seeing Joe or anything.  In that </p>
<p class="line" id="line3603"><a name="pos3603"></a>confusion as we were running for our lives, Joe could have come </p>
<p class="line" id="line3604"><a name="pos3604"></a>through.  That is my opinion.  And to answer, you know, about the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3605"><a name="pos3605"></a>gun, as I said I don't, I have got no recollection.  I have taken an </p>
<p class="line" id="line3606"><a name="pos3606"></a>oath and I can't recall giving the gun to Frans.  There is the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3607"><a name="pos3607"></a>possibility, after what happened I was a total wreck.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3608"><a name="pos3608"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Mr Brode, did you say you ran inside?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3609"><a name="pos3609"></a>MR BRODE:   I said I ran inside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3610"><a name="pos3610"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Were you not dragged inside by Frans?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3611"><a name="pos3611"></a>MR BRODE:   There is the possibility of that.  I will tell you why, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3612"><a name="pos3612"></a>because when I - well I did as Frans said, you know, froze because I </p>
<p class="line" id="line3613"><a name="pos3613"></a>did not realise that they were actually, physically shooting at us.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line3614"><a name="pos3614"></a>And then at that stage I heard, I felt someone sort of nudge me from </p>
<p class="line" id="line3615"><a name="pos3615"></a>the back, that could have been you know, when he grabbed me to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3616"><a name="pos3616"></a>pull me inside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3617"><a name="pos3617"></a>	But I felt that I made headway inside.  We were all sort of, it </p>
<p class="line" id="line3618"><a name="pos3618"></a>was almost like in a scrum.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3619"><a name="pos3619"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   I also want to suggest to you Mr Brode, that </p>
<p class="line" id="line3620"><a name="pos3620"></a>you, when you saw the attackers, they were inside the car and the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3621"><a name="pos3621"></a>car was coming in your direction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3622"><a name="pos3622"></a>MR BRODE:   The first time I saw what I saw, was the car standing </p>
<p class="line" id="line3623"><a name="pos3623"></a>there and guys, gentlemen, well not gentlemen - there were people </p>
<p class="line" id="line3624"><a name="pos3624"></a>standing outside, to me it looked as if they were throwing flares.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3625"><a name="pos3625"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   How far outside Machados did you go?  Did you </p>
<p class="line" id="line3626"><a name="pos3626"></a>go into the road, onto the pavement, near to the drain, where did </p>
<p class="line" id="line3627"><a name="pos3627"></a>you go?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3628"><a name="pos3628"></a>MR BRODE:   Yes, I would say I was standing between, well at an </p>
<p class="line" id="line3629"><a name="pos3629"></a>angle of between the yellow pole and - well, on that corner there.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line3630"><a name="pos3630"></a>You know, when you come out, to the right of the photo, off the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3631"><a name="pos3631"></a>step there where that white marks are.  I would say just before that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3632"><a name="pos3632"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Tell me, why would you be calling for the late </p>
<p class="line" id="line3633"><a name="pos3633"></a>Mr Cerqueira's gun when you initially or sorry, let me be fair, so </p>
<p class="line" id="line3634"><a name="pos3634"></a>that initially you thought that this was a bunch of guys I think you </p>
<p class="line" id="line3635"><a name="pos3635"></a>called them partygoers or something throwing crackers or </p>
<p class="line" id="line3636"><a name="pos3636"></a>something?  That is the first time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3637"><a name="pos3637"></a>MR BRODE:   That is correct, that is when I was standing out there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3638"><a name="pos3638"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   So, it was only the second time ... (intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line3639"><a name="pos3639"></a>MR BRODE:   No, no, no, can I interrupt you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3640"><a name="pos3640"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3641"><a name="pos3641"></a>MR BRODE:   I did say while I was looking at them, I was under </p>
<p class="line" id="line3642"><a name="pos3642"></a>the impression they were throwing firecrackers.  When they were on </p>
<p class="line" id="line3643"><a name="pos3643"></a>top of me and they shot in our direction, and there was smoke and </p>
<p class="line" id="line3644"><a name="pos3644"></a>you know, parts of the wall here and you know, you are getting all </p>
<p class="line" id="line3645"><a name="pos3645"></a>this into your eyes, what is it when a bullet sort of splinters up, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3646"><a name="pos3646"></a>shrapnel of the bullets, you know, when that was all, they were </p>
<p class="line" id="line3647"><a name="pos3647"></a>virtually on top of me when I realised wow, you know, here my life </p>
<p class="line" id="line3648"><a name="pos3648"></a>is in danger.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3649"><a name="pos3649"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   So the first time you saw them was they were </p>
<p class="line" id="line3650"><a name="pos3650"></a>standing immediately in front of the Tavern, shooting inside?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3651"><a name="pos3651"></a>MR BRODE:   That was what I thought.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3652"><a name="pos3652"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Shooting inside the Tavern?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3653"><a name="pos3653"></a>MR BRODE:   Well, shooting all around you know, it was all </p>
<p class="line" id="line3654"><a name="pos3654"></a>around.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3655"><a name="pos3655"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3656"><a name="pos3656"></a>MR BRODE:   It was all around, to me it looked like just you know, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3657"><a name="pos3657"></a>it is the festive season.  We had a nice busy evening and you know, I </p>
<p class="line" id="line3658"><a name="pos3658"></a>took it they were partygoers just told you know, okay back off now. </p>
<p class="line" id="line3659"><a name="pos3659"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   And the next time they were inside the car when </p>
<p class="line" id="line3660"><a name="pos3660"></a>you saw them when you came out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3661"><a name="pos3661"></a>MR BRODE:   No.  No, you are not hearing me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3662"><a name="pos3662"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   When you say the next time Mr Arendse, what do </p>
<p class="line" id="line3663"><a name="pos3663"></a>you mean by the next time?  It was still while he was still there on </p>
<p class="line" id="line3664"><a name="pos3664"></a>the pavement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3665"><a name="pos3665"></a>MR BRODE:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3666"><a name="pos3666"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   He's explained he stood there, he saw them, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3667"><a name="pos3667"></a>car then came towards him.  There was no next time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3668"><a name="pos3668"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   So you were only outside once?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3669"><a name="pos3669"></a>MR BRODE:   That is correct.  Wait, okay, what is it that you want </p>
<p class="line" id="line3670"><a name="pos3670"></a>to know?  You are talking about how many times I went outside </p>
<p class="line" id="line3671"><a name="pos3671"></a>during, after or before the shooting or what?  What is it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3672"><a name="pos3672"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   I want to know you saw them the first time, they </p>
<p class="line" id="line3673"><a name="pos3673"></a>were shooting as you say all over the place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3674"><a name="pos3674"></a>MR BRODE:   That is right, that is what brought to my attention.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line3675"><a name="pos3675"></a>The reason why I went outside is because I heard shots, but it </p>
<p class="line" id="line3676"><a name="pos3676"></a>sounded like a car backfiring or the throwing of crackers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3677"><a name="pos3677"></a>	And I went outside and I went through the whole scenario </p>
<p class="line" id="line3678"><a name="pos3678"></a>while I was outside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3679"><a name="pos3679"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Because Mr Brode your evidence is summarised </p>
<p class="line" id="line3680"><a name="pos3680"></a>as follows by the Judge in the criminal case at page 46.  And I will </p>
<p class="line" id="line3681"><a name="pos3681"></a>read it to you in Afrikaans.  Have you got the translation?  They </p>
<p class="line" id="line3682"><a name="pos3682"></a>were busy clearing up when he heard something that sounded like a </p>
<p class="line" id="line3683"><a name="pos3683"></a>car backfiring.  He ran outside and saw three men who looked as if </p>
<p class="line" id="line3684"><a name="pos3684"></a>they were throwing fire crackers and they got into a car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3685"><a name="pos3685"></a>	I just want to pause there.  So at that point, according to you </p>
<p class="line" id="line3686"><a name="pos3686"></a>- the Judge's summary, unless you must tell us that that summary </p>
<p class="line" id="line3687"><a name="pos3687"></a>was wrong or incorrect, at that point you see them get into the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3688"><a name="pos3688"></a>vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3689"><a name="pos3689"></a>MR BRODE:   At that point yes, but go back two lines or two </p>
<p class="line" id="line3690"><a name="pos3690"></a>sentences.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3691"><a name="pos3691"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Well, I will read to you from the beginning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3692"><a name="pos3692"></a>MR BRODE:   No, no, I've picked up from the beginning you know, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3693"><a name="pos3693"></a>going outside, now we are outside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3694"><a name="pos3694"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Go back or forward two sentences?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3695"><a name="pos3695"></a>MR BRODE:   I said back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3696"><a name="pos3696"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   When I go back two sentences, then it is the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3697"><a name="pos3697"></a>beginning of the summary of your sentence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3698"><a name="pos3698"></a>MR BRODE:   Okay, I apologise.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3699"><a name="pos3699"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Now, where do you want, must I just read the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3700"><a name="pos3700"></a>whole thing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3701"><a name="pos3701"></a>MR BRODE:   No, no, go back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3702"><a name="pos3702"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   I think, Mr Arendse, you shouldn't ask him where </p>
<p class="line" id="line3703"><a name="pos3703"></a>you should read.  You've got a question to put to him, read the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3704"><a name="pos3704"></a>portion that you think is relevant for the purposes of your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3705"><a name="pos3705"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Well, he asked me to read it Mr Chairman.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line3706"><a name="pos3706"></a>Benjamin Brode, like Jose Cerqueira the deceased of whom mention </p>
<p class="line" id="line3707"><a name="pos3707"></a>has just been made, were working at the restaurant Machados.  He </p>
<p class="line" id="line3708"><a name="pos3708"></a>along with Jose Cerqueira, his wife as well as another waiter stayed </p>
<p class="line" id="line3709"><a name="pos3709"></a>behind while all the guests have left the restaurant at quarter past </p>
<p class="line" id="line3710"><a name="pos3710"></a>eleven.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3711"><a name="pos3711"></a>	They were clearing up when they heard something like a </p>
<p class="line" id="line3712"><a name="pos3712"></a>motor vehicle backfiring, he ran outside and saw three men who </p>
<p class="line" id="line3713"><a name="pos3713"></a>appeared to be throwing fire crackers and they were getting into a </p>
<p class="line" id="line3714"><a name="pos3714"></a>car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3715"><a name="pos3715"></a>	As he stepped down from the step of the restaurant onto the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3716"><a name="pos3716"></a>pavement, he saw a large, dark motor vehicle parked against the one </p>
<p class="line" id="line3717"><a name="pos3717"></a>way.  He had not at that point realised that something was going </p>
<p class="line" id="line3718"><a name="pos3718"></a>wrong.  The motor vehicle then slowly moved in his direction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3719"><a name="pos3719"></a>	Now my question was, I am sorry if it wasn't clear to you, my </p>
<p class="line" id="line3720"><a name="pos3720"></a>question was are you seeing all this as you come out of Machados?  </p>
<p class="line" id="line3721"><a name="pos3721"></a>Are you seeing these men who are looking like they are throwing </p>
<p class="line" id="line3722"><a name="pos3722"></a>these crackers, getting into the car and the very next moment, they </p>
<p class="line" id="line3723"><a name="pos3723"></a>are coming towards you in the car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3724"><a name="pos3724"></a>MR BRODE:   That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3725"><a name="pos3725"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   And when they come towards you while they are </p>
<p class="line" id="line3726"><a name="pos3726"></a>inside the car, they are firing in your direction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3727"><a name="pos3727"></a>MR BRODE:   They turned their fire on us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3728"><a name="pos3728"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   While they were in the car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3729"><a name="pos3729"></a>MR BRODE:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3730"><a name="pos3730"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   So they never fired at you while they were </p>
<p class="line" id="line3731"><a name="pos3731"></a>standing outside or whatever they were doing, where they were </p>
<p class="line" id="line3732"><a name="pos3732"></a>standing outside the Heidelberg Tavern?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3733"><a name="pos3733"></a>MR BRODE:   Well, no bullet came passed my head, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3734"><a name="pos3734"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Okay.  So would it be correct to say that they </p>
<p class="line" id="line3735"><a name="pos3735"></a>fired only at you once they had been in the car, once they got into </p>
<p class="line" id="line3736"><a name="pos3736"></a>the car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3737"><a name="pos3737"></a>MR BRODE:   Yes, well, I don't think - they didn't fire at me before </p>
<p class="line" id="line3738"><a name="pos3738"></a>they got into the car.  Before they were on top of us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3739"><a name="pos3739"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   The firing came while the car was moving </p>
<p class="line" id="line3740"><a name="pos3740"></a>towards you and these three people they had by now gotten into the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3741"><a name="pos3741"></a>car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3742"><a name="pos3742"></a>MR BRODE:   They got in the car firing yes, but they were firing at </p>
<p class="line" id="line3743"><a name="pos3743"></a>the Heidelberg Tavern and they were firing you know, just all </p>
<p class="line" id="line3744"><a name="pos3744"></a>around, but nothing came towards us.  To me I have seen flares to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3745"><a name="pos3745"></a>both sides of the street, but not down the street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3746"><a name="pos3746"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Now, at that point, you are now observing this </p>
<p class="line" id="line3747"><a name="pos3747"></a>and you don't see the late Mr Cerqueira in the vicinity?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3748"><a name="pos3748"></a>MR BRODE:   Not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3749"><a name="pos3749"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Isn't it then possible that he comes out somehow </p>
<p class="line" id="line3750"><a name="pos3750"></a>passes you and had on his own, shot at the attackers, inviting them </p>
<p class="line" id="line3751"><a name="pos3751"></a>or maybe that word is entirely inappropriate, but then resulting in </p>
<p class="line" id="line3752"><a name="pos3752"></a>shots being fired also in your direction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3753"><a name="pos3753"></a>MR BRODE:   I didn't see that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3754"><a name="pos3754"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Because your focus must have been on this car </p>
<p class="line" id="line3755"><a name="pos3755"></a>and this car coming at you?  Surely that must have been your focus? </p>
<p class="line" id="line3756"><a name="pos3756"></a> You must have been terrified?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3757"><a name="pos3757"></a>MR BRODE:   Yes, that was our focus.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3758"><a name="pos3758"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Carry on please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3759"><a name="pos3759"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Did you pick up anything, did you pick up </p>
<p class="line" id="line3760"><a name="pos3760"></a>anything Mr Brode at the scene or from the deceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3761"><a name="pos3761"></a>MR BRODE:   I can't remember much.  It was difficult you know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3762"><a name="pos3762"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Could you remember whether Frans picked up </p>
<p class="line" id="line3763"><a name="pos3763"></a>anything?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3764"><a name="pos3764"></a>MR BRODE:   I can't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3765"><a name="pos3765"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   And I mean it is because you can't remember that </p>
<p class="line" id="line3766"><a name="pos3766"></a>is why you didn't mention the pouch at court or in any of your </p>
<p class="line" id="line3767"><a name="pos3767"></a>statements?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3768"><a name="pos3768"></a>MR BRODE:   I am trying my utmost to assist where I can.  I can't </p>
<p class="line" id="line3769"><a name="pos3769"></a>remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3770"><a name="pos3770"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Arendse, are there any other questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3771"><a name="pos3771"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3772"><a name="pos3772"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY ADV ARENDSE</p>
<p class="line" id="line3773"><a name="pos3773"></a>MR PRIOR:   No re-examination Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3774"><a name="pos3774"></a>NO RE-EXAMINATION BY MR PRIOR</p>
<p class="line" id="line3775"><a name="pos3775"></a>ADV SANDI:   Mr Brode, when you keep on saying I cannot </p>
<p class="line" id="line3776"><a name="pos3776"></a>remember, is that because of the manner in which your health has </p>
<p class="line" id="line3777"><a name="pos3777"></a>been effected by all this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3778"><a name="pos3778"></a>MR BRODE:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3779"><a name="pos3779"></a>ADV SANDI:   Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3780"><a name="pos3780"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Brode, thank you very much, you are excused </p>

<p class="line" id="line3783"><a name="pos3783"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3784"><a name="pos3784"></a>MR PRIOR:   Mr Chairman, I call the last witness, that is available, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3785"><a name="pos3785"></a>have we got enough time?  It is Mr Fourie?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3786"><a name="pos3786"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   I understand the interpreters have to leave at </p>
<p class="line" id="line3787"><a name="pos3787"></a>quarter to four.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3788"><a name="pos3788"></a>MR PRIOR:   Can we fit him in, I don't want to curtail his </p>
<p class="line" id="line3789"><a name="pos3789"></a>submission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3790"><a name="pos3790"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   I don't know how long you will be, so I can't tell </p>
<p class="line" id="line3791"><a name="pos3791"></a>you whether you should call him or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3792"><a name="pos3792"></a>MR PRIOR:   I understand my learned friend will be </p>
<p class="line" id="line3793"><a name="pos3793"></a>accommodating, he is not a witness to the events, he simply wants to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3794"><a name="pos3794"></a>make a submission, so if my learned friend can maybe give the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3795"><a name="pos3795"></a>Commission an indication, then we can fit Mr Fourie in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3796"><a name="pos3796"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Is he going to give evidence or make a </p>
<p class="line" id="line3797"><a name="pos3797"></a>statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3798"><a name="pos3798"></a>MR PRIOR:   He is going to give evidence, simply refer the </p>

<p class="line" id="line3830"><a name="pos3830"></a>parts of town.  Ag pappie, moenie worry nie, we will be </p>
<p class="line" id="line3831"><a name="pos3831"></a>all right."</p>
<p class="line" id="line3832"><a name="pos3832"></a>	Isn't it ironic that these would be the last words that my </p>
<p class="line" id="line3833"><a name="pos3833"></a>daughter and I would exchange on that evening, her last words in </p>
<p class="line" id="line3834"><a name="pos3834"></a>her life.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line3835"><a name="pos3835"></a>	Mr Chairman, panel members and others, my wife and I am </p>
<p class="line" id="line3836"><a name="pos3836"></a>here to honour and defend the memory of our only daughter, Lindi </p>
<p class="line" id="line3837"><a name="pos3837"></a>Anne, we also speak for our son who is in England and the rest of </p>
<p class="line" id="line3838"><a name="pos3838"></a>Lindi's family and her many friends who are may add are of many </p>
<p class="line" id="line3839"><a name="pos3839"></a>persuasions and some of whom are, if you will pardon the term, not </p>
<p class="line" id="line3840"><a name="pos3840"></a>white.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3841"><a name="pos3841"></a>	As Lindi's father, responsible for her existence, I accepted the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3842"><a name="pos3842"></a>responsibility of raising and caring for her to the best of my ability, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3843"><a name="pos3843"></a>together with the help and input of my wife and our son Anthony as </p>
<p class="line" id="line3844"><a name="pos3844"></a>well as those around us.  Those have made up Lindi's family, her </p>
<p class="line" id="line3845"><a name="pos3845"></a>school teachers, her fellow church members and her many other </p>
<p class="line" id="line3846"><a name="pos3846"></a>friends, to these I say thank you for returning the love that Lindi </p>
<p class="line" id="line3847"><a name="pos3847"></a>gave of so freely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3848"><a name="pos3848"></a>	Now that Lindi's mother has stated her position and feelings </p>
<p class="line" id="line3849"><a name="pos3849"></a>on the death of our only daughter, I thank her publicly for being a </p>
<p class="line" id="line3850"><a name="pos3850"></a>wonderful mother to Lindi.  Her example and encouragement will </p>
<p class="line" id="line3851"><a name="pos3851"></a>long be remembered by the rest of her family, especially by Anthony </p>
<p class="line" id="line3852"><a name="pos3852"></a>and myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3853"><a name="pos3853"></a>	I will then now continue and leave out the rest of my written </p>
<p class="line" id="line3854"><a name="pos3854"></a>submission, my typed submission and I  will make some </p>
<p class="line" id="line3855"><a name="pos3855"></a>observations, based on what I have seen and heard here Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line3856"><a name="pos3856"></a>Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3857"><a name="pos3857"></a>MR PRIOR:   Mr Fourie, do you adhere to the contents of those </p>
<p class="line" id="line3858"><a name="pos3858"></a>submissions contained in that statement and which is before the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3859"><a name="pos3859"></a>Committee and which will be considered by the Committee in its </p>
<p class="line" id="line3860"><a name="pos3860"></a>totality?  Do you adhere to those?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3861"><a name="pos3861"></a>MR FOURIE:   Mr Prior, yes, I do and I will refer you to the bottom </p>
<p class="line" id="line3862"><a name="pos3862"></a>of page 7 where I said to Mr Chairman, I mean every word I have </p>
<p class="line" id="line3863"><a name="pos3863"></a>said, especially in regard to bringing all the perpetrators and </p>
<p class="line" id="line3864"><a name="pos3864"></a>accomplices to court, and charging them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3865"><a name="pos3865"></a>MR PRIOR:   Thank you, would you like to make your additional </p>
<p class="line" id="line3866"><a name="pos3866"></a>submissions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3867"><a name="pos3867"></a>MR FOURIE:   I would like to do that if I may.  I will keep it as </p>
<p class="line" id="line3868"><a name="pos3868"></a>brief as possible.   I am looking at you right now, what is this, tell </p>
<p class="line" id="line3869"><a name="pos3869"></a>me, I am listening, what is this?  Is this a man or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3870"><a name="pos3870"></a>	Right, you are men, I am a man, I will talk straight to you and </p>
<p class="line" id="line3871"><a name="pos3871"></a>to the Chairman.  How do you know that you fatally wounded Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line3872"><a name="pos3872"></a>Jose Cerqueira, are you a seasoned or regular killer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3873"><a name="pos3873"></a>	You pleaded not guilty at the trial, yet you say here that you </p>
<p class="line" id="line3874"><a name="pos3874"></a>intended killing and wounding as many people as possible and now </p>
<p class="line" id="line3875"><a name="pos3875"></a>say you want amnesty.  How do I understand you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3876"><a name="pos3876"></a>	Mr Chairman, I do find it very difficult to accept that the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3877"><a name="pos3877"></a>statements given by these people are genuine, genuinely from them </p>
<p class="line" id="line3878"><a name="pos3878"></a>and perhaps not some concocted story to save their necks.  I am </p>
<p class="line" id="line3879"><a name="pos3879"></a>being blunt Sir, and I apologise if I do that, and I offend anybody, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3880"><a name="pos3880"></a>but I am also not apologising.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3881"><a name="pos3881"></a>	Accepting that I was not at the scene of the crime, I still </p>
<p class="line" id="line3882"><a name="pos3882"></a>believe I may ask why must I believe you when you say you did not </p>
<p class="line" id="line3883"><a name="pos3883"></a>enter the Tavern, when you say anything for that matter because </p>
<p class="line" id="line3884"><a name="pos3884"></a>bearing in mind what you have admitted to, that is the killing of </p>
<p class="line" id="line3885"><a name="pos3885"></a>innocent people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3886"><a name="pos3886"></a>	I cannot believe anything you say because I cannot trust </p>
<p class="line" id="line3887"><a name="pos3887"></a>murderers.  Why must I believe your statement about why you think </p>
<p class="line" id="line3888"><a name="pos3888"></a>you should be absolved of this crime, the murder of my daughter and </p>
<p class="line" id="line3889"><a name="pos3889"></a>others?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3890"><a name="pos3890"></a>	The post mortem should reveal quite accurately how close the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3891"><a name="pos3891"></a>killers were to the victims when they were shot.  I refer to page 12 </p>
<p class="line" id="line3892"><a name="pos3892"></a>in the court proceedings, three young women were shot that evening </p>
<p class="line" id="line3893"><a name="pos3893"></a>in the Heidelberg Tavern.  It is on page 44 of the bundle.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line3894"><a name="pos3894"></a>Bernadette Langford's heart was torn apart by the impact of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3895"><a name="pos3895"></a>bullet, Lindi Anne Fourie was shot in the right hand side of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3896"><a name="pos3896"></a>neck.  The bullet dragged all of the main blood veins off, and </p>
<p class="line" id="line3897"><a name="pos3897"></a>crushed her neck bones.  Rolanda Palm was also shot in the heart.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3898"><a name="pos3898"></a>	If we were firing wildly, how coincidental is it Mr Chairman, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3899"><a name="pos3899"></a>that three of the victims were shot in positions which would </p>
<p class="line" id="line3900"><a name="pos3900"></a>certainly have meant virtually instant death?  I also was trained in </p>
<p class="line" id="line3901"><a name="pos3901"></a>the use of firearms.  It is a frightening reality that lives with me </p>
<p class="line" id="line3902"><a name="pos3902"></a>every day of my wife, I regret having been trained to aim at another </p>
<p class="line" id="line3903"><a name="pos3903"></a>human being and shoot.  I hope to God I never will have to do it.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line3904"><a name="pos3904"></a>That is sincere and from my heart.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3905"><a name="pos3905"></a>	The apparent attitude of the applicants and particularly the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3906"><a name="pos3906"></a>so-called Commander of these men, tells me that their bona fides </p>
<p class="line" id="line3907"><a name="pos3907"></a>could be suspect and essentially destroys their possible chances of </p>
<p class="line" id="line3908"><a name="pos3908"></a>being given amnesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3909"><a name="pos3909"></a>	Excusme me Mr Chairman, I highlighted what I wanted to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3910"><a name="pos3910"></a>refer to from the notes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3911"><a name="pos3911"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3912"><a name="pos3912"></a>MR FOURIE:   Surely as a soldier you were trained to have no </p>
<p class="line" id="line3913"><a name="pos3913"></a>regrets, so why do you now say you regret your actions, those of </p>
<p class="line" id="line3914"><a name="pos3914"></a>killing innocent people?  Because one of your so-called leaders, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3915"><a name="pos3915"></a>speaking for all of you supposedly, on page 21 of their statement </p>
<p class="line" id="line3916"><a name="pos3916"></a>said the following and he was here on the 7th of October.  Page 24, </p>
<p class="line" id="line3917"><a name="pos3917"></a>this is a Brigadier Mofokeng.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line3918"><a name="pos3918"></a>	"We do not therefore regret that such operations took place </p>
<p class="line" id="line3919"><a name="pos3919"></a>and there is therefore nothing to apologise, because we </p>
<p class="line" id="line3920"><a name="pos3920"></a>believe of the justness of our war and the correctness of our </p>
<p class="line" id="line3921"><a name="pos3921"></a>struggle."</p>
<p class="line" id="line3922"><a name="pos3922"></a>	I find that statement contrary and contradictory to what the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3923"><a name="pos3923"></a>objective is here today in these hearings.  I am greatly disturbed by </p>
<p class="line" id="line3924"><a name="pos3924"></a>that Sir and it would appear that this has been carried over to these </p>
<p class="line" id="line3925"><a name="pos3925"></a>people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3926"><a name="pos3926"></a>	Mr Madasi, your impatience was very evident whilst you were </p>
<p class="line" id="line3927"><a name="pos3927"></a>being asked questions by Adv Prior.  Why do you get impatient and </p>
<p class="line" id="line3928"><a name="pos3928"></a>bear your teeth, you are asking and if you want to receive, surely </p>
<p class="line" id="line3929"><a name="pos3929"></a>you need to ask in a reasonably humble and if not civilised manner </p>
<p class="line" id="line3930"><a name="pos3930"></a>and tone of voice.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3931"><a name="pos3931"></a>	I would like to caution the applicants that perhaps they are </p>
<p class="line" id="line3932"><a name="pos3932"></a>better off in jail, than out on the street and I will just give you one </p>
<p class="line" id="line3933"><a name="pos3933"></a>reason.  I arrived home two days ago only to read in a newspaper </p>
<p class="line" id="line3934"><a name="pos3934"></a>five armed robberies in 48 hours in the little dorp where I live.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line3935"><a name="pos3935"></a>You've got competition and I am not being flippant here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3936"><a name="pos3936"></a>	Beware of your attitude Mr Mabala, you are asking for </p>
<p class="line" id="line3937"><a name="pos3937"></a>something, something bigger than you care to think about whilst you </p>
<p class="line" id="line3938"><a name="pos3938"></a>were busy with your dirty work.  So it is not in your best interest to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3939"><a name="pos3939"></a>appear cheeky or impatient, even when your own Defence Counsel </p>
<p class="line" id="line3940"><a name="pos3940"></a>asks you questions, questions that you are required to answer before </p>
<p class="line" id="line3941"><a name="pos3941"></a>your request can even be considered.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3942"><a name="pos3942"></a>	Now, I will say something which you might find strange, but I </p>
<p class="line" id="line3943"><a name="pos3943"></a>am still a person, okay, despite my anger and my hurt.  Have you </p>
<p class="line" id="line3944"><a name="pos3944"></a>seen an elderly person crying, look at me today, just look at this.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line3945"><a name="pos3945"></a>To the three and all of you related to this matter, I would not like to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3946"><a name="pos3946"></a>be in your shoes.  I also feel very, very sorry for your parents and </p>
<p class="line" id="line3947"><a name="pos3947"></a>others who are interested in you because they've got to bear it with </p>
<p class="line" id="line3948"><a name="pos3948"></a>you and with us.  That is very difficult.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3949"><a name="pos3949"></a>	Mr Chairman, I wrote to a few people asking them to tell us </p>
<p class="line" id="line3950"><a name="pos3950"></a>who Lindi Anne was because I thought perhaps the Committee here </p>
<p class="line" id="line3951"><a name="pos3951"></a>would like to get a different perspective onto the type of person, as </p>
<p class="line" id="line3952"><a name="pos3952"></a>to the type of person that Lindi Anne was.  Some of them sent you </p>
<p class="line" id="line3953"><a name="pos3953"></a>some of these, do you have them Mr Chairman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3954"><a name="pos3954"></a>MR PRIOR:   Mr Chairman, they are annexed to his statement 56 to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3955"><a name="pos3955"></a>61.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3956"><a name="pos3956"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   They are.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3957"><a name="pos3957"></a>MR FOURIE:   I won't read them, except Sir, if I may with your </p>
<p class="line" id="line3958"><a name="pos3958"></a>permission, read just one of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3959"><a name="pos3959"></a>	It is written by a man I have known for many years and for </p>
<p class="line" id="line3960"><a name="pos3960"></a>whom I have the greatest respect and he is one of the persons after </p>
<p class="line" id="line3961"><a name="pos3961"></a>whom I named my son, Anthony Johan Fourie.  He addressed it to </p>
<p class="line" id="line3962"><a name="pos3962"></a>the Chairman, it is from a Mr A.W. Hall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3963"><a name="pos3963"></a>	He said:  </p>
<p class="line" id="line3964"><a name="pos3964"></a>		"re the Heidelberg Tavern murder.  I have known the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3965"><a name="pos3965"></a>Fourie family for many years and can remember Lindi </p>
<p class="line" id="line3966"><a name="pos3966"></a>Anne virtually from birth.  I carried her on my </p>
<p class="line" id="line3967"><a name="pos3967"></a>shoulders when she was a child and I remember her as a </p>
<p class="line" id="line3968"><a name="pos3968"></a>young girl who was mad about horses and loved </p>
<p class="line" id="line3969"><a name="pos3969"></a>animals.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3970"><a name="pos3970"></a>		I remember her as a shy and conscientious schoolgirl </p>
<p class="line" id="line3971"><a name="pos3971"></a>and I remember her showing off the magnificent matric </p>
<p class="line" id="line3972"><a name="pos3972"></a>dance dress that she had made herself.  Lindi Anne had </p>
<p class="line" id="line3973"><a name="pos3973"></a>a strong character and an enquiring mind and was not in </p>
<p class="line" id="line3974"><a name="pos3974"></a>the least bit surprised when I learnt that she had chosen </p>
<p class="line" id="line3975"><a name="pos3975"></a>civil engineering as a career.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3976"><a name="pos3976"></a>		In fact being a civil engineer myself, I was proud of her. </p>
<p class="line" id="line3977"><a name="pos3977"></a> The one thing that never failed to impress me about </p>
<p class="line" id="line3978"><a name="pos3978"></a>Lindi Anne was her pleasant and gentle nature.  She </p>
<p class="line" id="line3979"><a name="pos3979"></a>gave the impression that she didn't have an enemy in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3980"><a name="pos3980"></a>world.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3981"><a name="pos3981"></a>		Lindi Anne was not class or race conscious and </p>
<p class="line" id="line3982"><a name="pos3982"></a>accepted people as they were.   She always looked for </p>
<p class="line" id="line3983"><a name="pos3983"></a>the good in people.  She had grown into a charming and </p>
<p class="line" id="line3984"><a name="pos3984"></a>talented young lady who would, I am sure, have become </p>
<p class="line" id="line3985"><a name="pos3985"></a>a valuable citizen and would have contributed positively </p>
<p class="line" id="line3986"><a name="pos3986"></a>to the future of this country had she not been murdered </p>
<p class="line" id="line3987"><a name="pos3987"></a>in her prime a few short months before graduating as a </p>
<p class="line" id="line3988"><a name="pos3988"></a>civil engineer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3989"><a name="pos3989"></a>		I cannot express the anger I felt when I learnt of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line3990"><a name="pos3990"></a>senseless murder at the Heidelberg Tavern, quite apart </p>
<p class="line" id="line3991"><a name="pos3991"></a>from the obvious anguish and irreplaceable loss suffered </p>
<p class="line" id="line3992"><a name="pos3992"></a>by her family and friends, our nation has been deprived </p>
<p class="line" id="line3993"><a name="pos3993"></a>of a really good above-average person, that had so </p>
<p class="line" id="line3994"><a name="pos3994"></a>much to offer society, murdered by a bunch of morally </p>
<p class="line" id="line3995"><a name="pos3995"></a>bankrupt nobodies, who have nothing to offer anyone.  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line3996"><a name="pos3996"></a>will be extremely disappointed if those responsible for </p>
<p class="line" id="line3997"><a name="pos3997"></a>Lindi Anne's death, are granted amnesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3998"><a name="pos3998"></a>		At the time of the attack, the political climate in south </p>
<p class="line" id="line3999"><a name="pos3999"></a>Africa was already changing dramatically and I cannot </p>
<p class="line" id="line4000"><a name="pos4000"></a>see that the perpetrators of the attack, can justify their </p>
<p class="line" id="line4001"><a name="pos4001"></a>actions on political grounds in any way whatsoever.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4002"><a name="pos4002"></a>		My feelings are not biased on racism.  Civilisation is </p>
<p class="line" id="line4003"><a name="pos4003"></a>not man's natural state, it is an ideal that requires </p>
<p class="line" id="line4004"><a name="pos4004"></a>constant and diligent effort.  We all harbour violent </p>
<p class="line" id="line4005"><a name="pos4005"></a>thoughts from time to time, but the difference between </p>
<p class="line" id="line4006"><a name="pos4006"></a>a civilised person and a barbarian, like the Worcester </p>
<p class="line" id="line4007"><a name="pos4007"></a>bombers and the Heidelberg murderers, is that the latter </p>
<p class="line" id="line4008"><a name="pos4008"></a>have no moral integrity to guide their actions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4009"><a name="pos4009"></a>		Such people are a menace to any community and should </p>
<p class="line" id="line4010"><a name="pos4010"></a>be removed from society permanently".</p>
<p class="line" id="line4011"><a name="pos4011"></a>	Mr Chairman, I will close with the statement that I have, one </p>
<p class="line" id="line4012"><a name="pos4012"></a>paragraph Sir.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line4013"><a name="pos4013"></a>	You see Mr Chairman, for too long now, I want the people </p>
<p class="line" id="line4014"><a name="pos4014"></a>here to hear this, a few people in this country of ours, have had any </p>
<p class="line" id="line4015"><a name="pos4015"></a>respect for each other, the people, the courts, not anything that </p>
<p class="line" id="line4016"><a name="pos4016"></a>resembles a normal society.  Do wish to see this type of thinking </p>
<p class="line" id="line4017"><a name="pos4017"></a>continue?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4018"><a name="pos4018"></a>	Nobody in their right mind would wish it to continue, </p>
<p class="line" id="line4019"><a name="pos4019"></a>therefore I have empathy for you, the Police, the Justice system and </p>
<p class="line" id="line4020"><a name="pos4020"></a>all others who are trying to bring about a change of attitude and </p>

<p class="line" id="line4022"><a name="pos4022"></a>return to a normal and safe society.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4023"><a name="pos4023"></a>	May you be granted all the courage and strength necessary to </p>
<p class="line" id="line4024"><a name="pos4024"></a>carry out the task that you face.  Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4025"><a name="pos4025"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Arendse, are there any questions you wish to </p>
<p class="line" id="line4026"><a name="pos4026"></a>put to this witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4027"><a name="pos4027"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   No, Mr Chairman, except to say that Mr Fourie </p>
<p class="line" id="line4028"><a name="pos4028"></a>made a number of controversial statements which if I do engage him </p>
<p class="line" id="line4029"><a name="pos4029"></a>on it, it is not going to take us any further.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4030"><a name="pos4030"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   You will address us if you think it is relevant at </p>
<p class="line" id="line4031"><a name="pos4031"></a>that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4032"><a name="pos4032"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4033"><a name="pos4033"></a>NO CROSS-EXAMINATION BY ADV ARENDSE</p>
<p class="line" id="line4034"><a name="pos4034"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you Mr Fourie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4035"><a name="pos4035"></a>MR FOURIE:   Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4036"><a name="pos4036"></a>MR PRIOR:   Thank you Mr Chairman, I have, due to the lateness of </p>
<p class="line" id="line4037"><a name="pos4037"></a>the hour and there are several other matters which will be decided </p>
<p class="line" id="line4038"><a name="pos4038"></a>upon in due course, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4039"><a name="pos4039"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Will the date for the resumed hearing be finalised </p>
<p class="line" id="line4040"><a name="pos4040"></a>between you and Mr Arendse?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4041"><a name="pos4041"></a>MR PRIOR:   Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4042"><a name="pos4042"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Can I request, as I have already requested, that </p>
<p class="line" id="line4043"><a name="pos4043"></a>the evidence be obtained as to how cartridges are expelled from </p>
<p class="line" id="line4044"><a name="pos4044"></a>firearms, request that you get someone to go through that video and </p>
<p class="line" id="line4045"><a name="pos4045"></a>insofar as possible, indicate on the sketch plan, or a larger sketch </p>
<p class="line" id="line4046"><a name="pos4046"></a>plan, where the cartridge cases as are shown on the video, are in </p>
<p class="line" id="line4047"><a name="pos4047"></a>fact.  This could perhaps be done by agreement, that that correctly </p>
<p class="line" id="line4048"><a name="pos4048"></a>reflects what is shown in the video.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4049"><a name="pos4049"></a>	So if we want to see where they are in the building, we don't </p>
<p class="line" id="line4050"><a name="pos4050"></a>have to go through the whole video again, we can just put it onto a </p>
<p class="line" id="line4051"><a name="pos4051"></a>sketch plan.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4052"><a name="pos4052"></a>MR PRIOR:   Thank you, Mr Chairman, we will comply with that </p>
<p class="line" id="line4053"><a name="pos4053"></a>request.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4054"><a name="pos4054"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Mr Chairman, will we also have a transcript </p>
<p class="line" id="line4055"><a name="pos4055"></a>available?  A transcript of the proceedings, a typed transcript?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4056"><a name="pos4056"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   You can raise that with the administration.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4057"><a name="pos4057"></a>ADV ARENDSE:   Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4058"><a name="pos4058"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you very much, the meeting will now </p>
