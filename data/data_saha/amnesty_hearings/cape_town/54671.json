He brought out many memories because of the traumatic nature of these incidents.  This was specifically true of his memories regarding the interrogation of people\".\nThe next paragraph:\n\"It is my professional opinion that Mr Benzien is not being intentionally vague about detail regarding his work in the security branch.  I am convinced that his weak memory is due to PTSD and major depression, as I encounter this phenomena almost daily in my work with such patients\"\nThe last paragraph at the bottom, second line from the bottom:\n\"He expressed remorse and self loathing and wished that he was never appointed to the task\"\nNext page, page 4(3):\n\"The patient had at least two of the following symptoms of hyper-arousal that were not present before the traumatic events or events\"\nA list is then mentioned there.  Please turn to page 5, the paragraph which reads:\n\"Concentration:  Mr Benzien has severe impairment of concentration and memory for detail. Other symptoms are indecisiveness and difficulty in thinking clearly.  This symptom is also a main feature of PTSD and has been disclosed more fully in 6.1\"\nParagraph 7 - The Conclusion:\n\"Mr Benzien suffered from severe PTSD and a major depressive episode caused by the events he experienced in the course of his duties\"\nThe next paragraph:\n\"In my professional opinion Mr Benzien does not suffer from a personality disorder which includes anti-social personality disorder also known as psychopathic\"\nPage 6, right at the top:\n\"His personal life therefore does not evidence the aggression showed in the execution of his duty.  Both PTSD and major depression impairs a patients memory and it becomes evident during therapy that Mr Benzien has blocked out large areas of experience.\n\tWhen exposed to unpleasant circumstances of severe trauma, patients block out negative experiences.  Sometimes people will even block out even positive experiences together with negative events in an unconscious effort to forget unpleasant detail.  It is in this light that Mr Benzien's recall - ability should be seen.  \n\tIn my opinion he's not untruthful in his effort because I was witness to the painful process he underwent to make the decision to apply for amnesty.  He is a person that has always considered himself loyal to the South African police and his colleagues and a decision to appear before the TRC has been traumatic.  \n\tThis has been a painful process which started long before the act of applying for amnesty and after seeing his suffering during the last six months.  I do not believe that he will make a mockery of the process he is presently participating in, the toll his work has taken from him and his family has been too great.  \n\tHe was a good detective who had an excellent record in breaking crime and because of his success he was recruited to a position that has broken him mentally and physically\".\nIt was signed by Ria Kotze who is a psychologist.

I'm sorry, may I just look at my document, I think it's incomplete - my apologies.\n\tThe Government of the day in whose service each and every member of the South African police was, they determined policy and expected of it's officials to actually carry out policy.  And it was common cause that the liberation organisations were striding for the toppling of the South African Government and that that Government expected of the security forces to avert the so-called \"total onslaught\".",

            "That is correct.  I'd like to emphasise that this onslaught was not limited to certain areas but that it was aimed against the Republic as a whole.  We therefore can't judge issues and incidents in the Western Cape in isolation and we also can't judge the actions of members of the security branch in the Western Cape, in isolation.  There was a line of command which went from the most junior member to the commissioner of police.\n\tThere was legislation and departmental regulations and provisions determined exactly how a detainee should be dealt with in terms of Section 29 of  Act 74 of 1982 - The Internal Security Act.  This legislation and regulations placed certain obligations on the inspector  of detainees, district surgeons, magistrates and commanding officers on various levels and attached to other divisions of the police.\n\tFrom time to time it also necessitated reporting to certain bodies.  There was a register which had to be kept up to date and visitors to the detainees would have to fill in this register during their visits to the detainees and have to sign it.  There was a prescribed procedure to be followed should a Section 29 detainee lay a complaint.  \n\tAllegations of assault inter alias had to be investigated by a senior officer in the detective branch and not by an officer attached to the security branch.  By means of Advocate Cook, I requested the police to place at my disposal the relevant Section 29 detainee files but I was told that it couldn't be traced.  \n\tIn respect of the armed struggle against the RSA, as I've already said, it was necessary to go back to that issue to 1961 when the ANC/SACP Alliance committed themselves to an armed struggle.  As the armed struggle escalated, it was expected of the police more and more to become involved in situations which fell outside the normal boundaries of policing functions.\n\tThe South African police was since 1967 used to do border duty in Zimbabwe and obviously they had to receive special training for that and in this way they were introduced to conventional warfare.  This exposure resulted in the fact that principle of minimum of violence was severely prejudiced and to a certain extent was actually just swept aside.  Border duty for the police was later extended to Namibia and also in relation to our own borders with our neighbouring countries, which brought about more and more exposure to conventional warfare.\n\tEven later the battle which was being waged on our borders moved to within our country and this condition and situation and how it developed was discussed by the former Commissioner of Police, General van der Merwe, in a statement which he handed in the amnesty application of Brigadier Jack Cronje and others and a copy has been attached to this statement in front of you now.\n\tI'd like to refer to specific portions in this statement because it deals with a period and circumstances which has an influence on or an effect of the application of these two members.    And if you just look at these portions, paragraph - page 3, paragraph 5:\n\"Amongst other things the principles of minimum violence and the bringing of perpetrators before criminal courts was to be seriously effected and even eroded\".",

Their task was to ensure healthy revolutionary and democratic inter-relations within society and to serve the interests of the people in general\".\nAnd at the bottom of that very same page, we continue - last line:\n\"It was very often quite sufficient to be merely suspected of being a sell-out of collaborator in order to pay the ultimate price in the most dreadful manner\".\nAnd then page 18, which refers certain statistics regarding necklace murders, and here I would like to point out the following:\n1986 - The number of people killed, the total number along with injured - people injured, in relation to the others you will see that in that year it reached it's height.\n\tOn the next page where it deals with: \"Setting alight of persons\", once again we have the same position there.  Paragraph 16 on page 19:\n\"As a direct result of this particular revolutionary climate, the South African police and the South African defence force were compelled to pool their various resources to combat the ever increasing tide of unrest and violence.\n\tJoint planning was undertaken in terms of the various structures of the National Management System which functioned of the authority of the State Security Council and which also incorporated the constitutional, economic and Social Affairs Cabinet Committees.  All Government departments were eventually drawn into the National Management System in an all out effort to find solutions to the ever increasing security problem\".\nBack on page 3, paragraph 8.1:\n\"Since the ANC/SACP Alliance and other organisations decided to topple the Government by means of violence, the South African police and more specifically the security branch, were actually facing a super human task.  On the one hand they were supposed to maintain law and order according to normal legal principles and on the other hand they were supposed to protect the Government and society against violence and acts of terror in circumstances in which the other party was not bound by any rules\"",

            "That's right.\n\"in circumstances which the other party wasn't bound by any rules.  Apart from this the view of the Government of the day was that the Republic was waging a war for all practical purposes and that the enemy had to be defeated at all costs.  The armed struggle was characterised by several phases.\n\tInitially, Umkhonto weSizwe, MK and other organisations directed their actions mainly against Government buildings and the sabotage of those buildings and other property.  The Soweto unrest during 1976, placed the Black youth in the forefront of the battle and the ANC/SACP Alliance exploited the situation and utilised the youth in it's revolutionary battle.\n\tWith the establishment of the United Democratic Front in 1983, a new phase was entered.  Many organisations joined the UDF country-wide and although it could never be determined exactly in what respect the ANC/SACP Alliance controlled the UDF, there was close co-operation between them.   \n\tAnd under leadership of the UDF, the defiance against the Government and Government institutions escalated quite sharply and this was followed by a civil disobedience with a view to making the country ungovernable.\n\tDuring 1985, the ANC Consultative Conference in Kobwe, Zambia took place, during which it was decided that the distinction between so-called hard and soft targets no longer applied.  Violence escalated and many civilians, including defenceless women and children were cruelly killed, injured or maimed.  \n\tThe SACP/ANC Alliance, UDF and other organisations who were all striving for the same objective, used everything in their power to make the country ungovernable and especially to alienate the Black community from the police and Government.  Intimidation was used on a large scale to force members of the Black community to work with them.\n\tDefiance and treason was very brutally punished and when there was the slightest suspicion that a person was actually collaborating with the police led to a person being killed by means of the necklace method and that is crueller than most of the methods used by the Nazi's.\n\tMembers of the security forces and in particular South African police, were regarded as so-called hard targets and could be killed at random and at will and became more and more the victims of violence.  Black members in Black townships lived in fear of their lives and property day by day.\n\tTo avert this violent onslaught, the previous Government mustered all the forces at it's disposal and joined together it's structures under the auspices of the state security council.  The National Security Management System also had a significant influence on the police culture\" \n\tAnd in this respect I'd like to refer to pages 151 and 152 of a book entitled: \"The Other Side of the Story\", written by Major General H D Stadler and published during February of 1997.  This has also been attached to the statement in front of you, it's the very last section.  According to this you will see that the police commanding officers right down to the lowest level, had participation in some way or another in this system, a system which had the State President and Cabinet right at the top.\n\tOnce again it must be pointed out that there was a chain of command or a line of communication from grassroots level right to the highest levels of command, and it would therefore not have been too far fetched to assume that an instruction coming from a commanding officer sitting in a system, was actually an instruction coming from the highest level of authority.\n\tThe objective of these different structures was - in respect of the Government, the security forces and the different State departments, to actually join them together in a cohesive unit.  The structures succeeded to a large extent to actually carry out this object.  \n\tThe South African police and more particularly the security branch or rather from the point of view of the South African police and in particular the security branch, the interest were to ensure the effective maintenance of law and order and also to guarantee the safety of the community. And this was so closely interwoven with the activities of the police that the police in this respect and in the circumstances which obtained at the time, was necessarily seen as an ally of Government.\n\tIn the past time, members of the then Security Council have testified before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and I would like to refer very briefly to certain quotations as it appeared in \"Die Burger\", namely \"Die Burger, Wednesday, 15 October 1997 - I quote:\n\"But according to Botha, not one of use who were in the previous Government can say today that there was no suspicion from our side that members of the South African police were involved in certain irregular activities\".\n\tThe other heading: \"Use of Language Leads to Illegal Conduct\", in the same newspaper he, Botha said that it was unfortunate that certain sentences in State Security Council Minutes are now being taken out of the context in which they were used, for instance reference to: \"eliminate\".  \n\tIn reality it is followed by explanations which amount to detention without trial and it is a fact that our country has been placed into a certain war psychosis where such words and expressions which were gained for military usage, has now become part of our vernacular and I now realise with a sense of shock that this terminology apparently gave rise to illegal conduct by policemen - that is what Mr Vlok said.\n\tWhat is of importance here is what the consequences were of this interpretation by policemen of terms used by the State Security Council and according to them, had an innocent connotation or interpretation.  If it led to the torture or even the killing of persons in respect of whom those words were used, you would then expect that the State Security Council would immediately take suitable steps to prevent a repetition.\n\tIf correctly reported, then it's hard to understand how Mr Vlok has now with a sense of shock learnt that this terminology and use of language, has apparently led to illegal conduct to policemen.  \"Die Burger, Thursday, 16th of October 1997, Wessels said that he does not believe the political defence of: \"I did not know\", he didn't believe that he could actually rely on this.  \n\tIn many instances he didn't want to know - each and every person in this country knew that people were being tortured.  Perhaps that's putting it a bit too broadly, perhaps Mr Wessels meant here that each politician knew that people were being tortured.  During my term in office in Cape Town, extreme pressure was placed by the Joint Security Management System on the security branch, in particular to stem the tide of murder and violence.  \n\tAnd obviously I gave members under my command instructions to do everything in their power to apprehend people who were guilty of these things and to extract as much information as possible from the detainees so that the entire network operative in the country could be disrupted in time to prevent further loss of life.   This was the only way in which we could protect lives and properties. \n\tI never gave any member an instruction to place a wet bag over anybody's head or to torture them in any other way.  I was however very much aware of the fact that members' success could be ascribed to the use of unconventional questioning or interrogation methods.  It would have been naive of me to believe that they would extract information in any other way from a well trained terrorist and to do so quite quickly.\n\tAnybody who in any way had responsibility in respect of a Section 29 detainee and of whom it is here alleged that he was assaulted or tortured in any other way, must have been aware or must have suspected that unconventional interrogation methods were being used.  And their silence in this regard can be interpreted as at least a condemnation of it, if not approval.\n\tThe applications before you deal with acts or omissions committed during a period when revolution was at it's height.  The situation which existed during this heated armed battle from the ANC/SACP Alliance who have the same objectives and in which the masses involved in different ways.  On the other hand you had the security forces and more specifically the security branch as part of a National Security Management System established by a Government which was clinging to it's power and was using everything at it's disposal to fight the enemy because the enemy was actually trying to topple the Government.\n\tPerhaps a better word which I'd like to buy from Mr Meyer, is \"eliminate\" rather that to stem.  This situation, speeches and addresses by leading figures and politicians regarding the killing and destruction of property ensured that their was a total situation of war.  The South African police and more in particular the security branch, was placed in a totally untenable situation, they had to avert the onslaught in terms of the normal rules of the combating of crime \tAnd it was this impossible task and constant pressure exerted by the Government and obvious condemnation of abuses and even an admission or rather a commendation, an encouragement for services rendered in the act or in the battle of terrorism, this all led to the fact that the people in the so-called: \"engine room\", did not have direct - didn't need direct instructions to commit certain wrongful acts but they had a bona fide belief that that was virtually the only criterion.\n\tI have no doubt that if these members believed that they could rely on the protection of their seniors and politicians and if this was not the case, these specific acts would never have been committed.  I also have no doubt in my mind that as investigations continue, politicians must assume more and more responsibility for that which happened during their reign.  It is ultimately a fact that the police was one of the instruments used to achieve their purpose.  Thank you Chairperson.",

We also have difficulties with the whole notion of post-traumatic stress disorder because the Committee will have \nheard that the trauma occurred many years ago and it did not manifest itself during trials at which Mr Benzien testified - where he testified with complete knowledge, it seems to have arisen in 1994 when these particular proceedings were contemplated.  \n\tAnd our concern is that the cause of the amnesia is this particular hearing rather than any condition which Mr Benzien has and we should therefore like that aspect to be clarified.

As I've said for me the real interrogation started when Benzien and Nortje started questioning me.

            "I must mention that I was arrested on the Saturday morning the 15th of August, on the 16th of August I arrived in Cape Town - that was the Sunday because they drove me down to Cape Town overnight.  I didn't sleep at all that night, I was also a little bit hungry.  Whilst I was being interrogated they also asked me whether I wanted to eat something and I said yes, I would like to eat something.  They then gave me - I think if I recall correctly, chips and the reason why I'm mentioning this is that it was offered to me - the food and every time that I wanted to take something to eat they would bring it to my mouth and then pull back as soon as I wanted to bite it.   So in affect I had nothing to eat.\n\tAnd my further experiences as regards this interrogation were that I was hit - I was physically hit by Benzien and Nortje, more so by Benzien than by Nortje.   On that specific Sunday they had already earlier on that day, asked me whether I wanted to make a statement in front of a Magistrate and I said that I didn't want to make a statement and that I wasn't prepared to do that.  \n\tBut there was this one specific incident - in the process of giving them some information, they wanted to know from me who these people were that I was supposed to have met in Lesotho.  I was given instructions to carry a letter which I should not open until such time as I had crossed the Lesotho border and then I would find out who these people were and where I was supposed to meet them.  And I followed these instructions, I didn't open the letter.\n\tWhen I was arrested, I did away with the letter.  When they questioned me about this I answered them and I think to my regret, I said to them that I'd eaten the letter.   When I told them this, Benzien told me that he wanted to know who these people were that I was supposed to meet in Lesotho.  He then took me out of that room in the Culemborg building and took me to a different place, it was somewhere at the back of a building.  I can recall that we went past some steps and we went round the back and it was almost an open plan type of room.  \n\tThere he told me that I should defecate because he wanted to actually get this letter out of my stomach.  And whilst I was busy defecating he put plastic gloves, surgical gloves on his hands and he put his hand into my anus.  When I told him what he was doing would not get the letter back - when the full knowledge that I hadn't actually swallowed or eaten the letter, he then took a broom which was standing close by and he then pressed this into my anus to try and get hold of the letter.\n\tThere was very little which actually came out of my stomach because I hadn't had a lot to eat and as far as I can recall yes, there wasn't much that came out of my stomach.  I can't recall very specifically what period of time this was but from quite late that day I was really quite tired, I was very sleepy.  The interrogation took place during the whole of that day and it was late that night when I started giving out information to Benzien.  It was that night - if I recall correctly, that I went to point out houses belonging to my comrades. \n\tHe took me along specifically, he covered my head - that I can recall, when he was driving with me.  Furthermore when I was taken to the Sea Point police cells, I was handcuffed - my feet were handcuffed to the bed and basically I fell asleep because I was so tired.  I was forced to urinate and to defecate whilst I was so manacled to the bed or handcuffed to the bed.  In any event, the point I'm trying to make is that in that time they brought some of my comrades in there and they told them that I'm the one that's responsible for their arrests, that I'm the one that's working with them.\n\tI can clearly remember Anwar Dramat told me he was in my cell, I don't know about that.  But whenever they wanted to question me they would wake me up and take me back to Culemborg.  I think that's my experiences with this man Benzien.  I developed a - he installed a fear in me.  When other security policemen came to me I would feel more relaxed but when Benzien comes to me, it was difficult for me to be relaxed.  \n\tHe was the type of person that - he can speak to you very nicely and he can come across as the world's friendliest person and within a second he can change and he become and behave like an animal.
