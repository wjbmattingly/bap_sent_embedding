Thank you, Chairperson.\n\tThe affidavit reads thus:\n\"Thembinkosi Henge states under oath:  I reside at number 603, Jacobs Avenue, kwaMandlenkosi, Beaufort West.  I joined the Pan Africanist Congress during 1992.  Ms Nana Bokwe, also a member of PAC, recruited me to join APLA, the military wing of the PAC.  Early in 1993, I joined the ranks of APLA.  I'm the card-carrying member of the PAC.\n\t\tMy Commander was the late Sichumiso Nonxuba and his codename was Lester.  I was trained in Qumbu, Mvumelwano location in the former Transkei, between April or May, to June 1993.\n\t\tMy training took two months.  It was a basic military training which was said to be a crash course.  After completion of the training, I returned to Beaufort West.  \n\t\tWhile I was at home I was phoned by Lester, late Sichumiso Nonxuba who was in Umtata, to select a target that is specifically Translux Bus, to attack it.  There were two Translux buses that were passing through Beaufort West en route to and from Cape Town.  One of them was travelling at about 12 midnight and another at 5 in the morning and I was to choose which of the buses would be a best target in my operation.\n\t\tAfter I had chosen my target, I reported back to Lester, who also gave me further orders to go and pick up firearms at Ngangelizwe in Umtata.  The firearms were with Polite Nonxuba ...\"\nChairperson, a correction, Polite is Xuma, not Nonxuba, it's Xuma.",

I knew that the Translux bus, particularly the midnight one, was patronised by whites.  I discovered that after I made two weeks reconnaissance.\"\n...(intervention)",

Such an attack to such class of people would speed up the change, especially the negotiations that were on at that time.  It was also to weaken the apartheid government, because Translux as a parastatal body would lose money as people, the whites would feel insecure.\n\t\tIt must be mentioned that the benefit I referred to is the power they have to vote and we, the African masses, had no vote.\n\t\tLate Sichumiso Nonxuba informed me that I was to be a Commander of the operation and Mandla would be sent from Umtata to Beaufort West, to assist in the operation.  \n\t\tOn his arrival, I showed him the operation area and plan.  The following day, the 27th August 1993 at 12 midnight, we attacked the Translux bus at Ghamka River bridge near Fort Beaufort town.  The Translux bus was from Cape Town en route to Johannesburg.  We both retreated after firing some shots.  We heard later by late Sichumiso Nonxuba, when we phoned, that he heard the news that eight people have been injured in our operation.\n\t\tOn the 28th, Friday, of August 1993, Mandla went back to Umtata with both firearms and ammunition.  We were never arrested and it was on the 9th of May 1996 that I was questioned by police with regard to the 27th August 1993 incident.  I denied any knowledge of that matter.  \n\t\tThe operation was successful because the State President, then Mr de Klerk, was out of the country in Chile, he stated that there were parties that were going to withdraw from the negotiations and he also cancelled his official trip and came back to South Africa.\n\t\tA few months later a date of the general election was set.

When you enter Beaufort West you approach the town itself, there's a bend there and at that bend there are lights and there is a bridge, so there's a river running under the bridge.  So one, we are two in this operation, we need to see our target from a distance, so the lights will help us to see the target from a distance, so that we can advance, because we are hiding at the soup kitchen, at the ...(indistinct) there, at the soup kitchen.  So when we saw the bus coming, then we ran and approached that, I think in a 15 metre distance, then we started to attack it.\n\tWe wanted to attack the driver first, the driver was the real target, because by attacking the driver we knew that the bus would lose it's way and went down to the river, so that many people could get injured or killed or whatever at that time.  So when we attacked the bus, right, that didn't happen, the bus went through after we attacked and it stopped on the bridge.  After it stopped, I think for a second or so, then it went on.  \n\tThen we ran back to our hide-out, then we lay down.  I went home, I left Mandla at the hide-out.  I went home and slept.  Then early morning Sichumiso phoned me.  But let me explain it this way.  Sorry.  When Sichumiso phoned me and gave me the order to attack that bus, one, I knew that I don't have to question orders first, but in my subconscious mind after I did my whole reconnaissance and saw that no, this bus was boarded by whites, as they called them.  Right.  There's one thing that I want, I'm in a struggle to liberate Azanian masses, the masses that had no vote, no right to vote.  The whites have a right to vote.  If he don't vote that is his own or her own will, why he didn't vote, but he had the right.  The South African government gave them that right and they didn't use them if they did or they didn't. So the people who are in the bus, I had nothing personal against them, there's not that I would have gained money or whatever and they should not take it as if that was a criminal incident or what.  \n\tSo it was unfortunate that there might be people who were not, who were innocent and who were travelling from Cape Town to a holiday or whatever, but due to the cause of the struggle, it was unfortunate that their journey was cut short.

But Chairperson, we also know that it was only PAC in the negotiations in Kempton Park, which was negotiating with the gun, holding the gun.  They did not suspend the armed struggle.  Whilst they were negotiating, at the same time they were busy operating.  And Chairperson, the Committee knows that as a result of that, whilst they were in negotiations, in the same May, PAC offices all over the country were raided and leaders were arrested.  It nearly destroyed the whole negotiating process, as a result of that.  \n\tAnd as a result of that, PAC, it's also documented that they decided APLA was to intensify the struggle.  And some of the incidents one would know, one of the Members, Mr Lax knows that the Diepkloof incident was also a sequel of that, that you must hit hard to the enemy after those raidings of the PAC offices and the arresting of their leaders.  So they intensified and at the same time they were in the negotiations.\n\tAnd Chairperson, we also know that it was the year in which the late Commander of APLA, Sabelo Pama, declared it as the Year of the Great Storm, and we know what does that mean.  And at that year it was - in fact if I may put it in a more crude manner, it was almost a year, they wanted it to be a year of anarchy, you know.  So all those things, Chairperson, it's known by the Committee, but the victims don't know about those things.\n\tAnd also, Chairperson, we know that in as much as the PAC was at pains to explain its policies, but these things happened that they - in fact the last document which was submitted by Ngelan Moendane, when the Chairman of the TRC process asked that the PAC must spell out is policy towards whites and they explained it and how they interpreted it.

Chairperson and the victims, that PAC believes that - in fact how he puts it, the founding President of the PAC, to say that it's a plain dishonesty to say you hate the sjambok, not the person who is wielding it.  So their policy was based on that.  So saying, look you can fight and say you are fighting apartheid, the laws, but as long as the people who are passing those laws, you are not shaking them, you will never - they will just change the laws.  The best thing is to hit the person and that's how they ... And they went further to say even if you can say, argument, and say look, the person who were passing the laws were members of parliament, why don't you attack them?\n\tBut you say look, the argument is that who was saying in the post office, you are in the wrong queue, were the members of parliament.  Or were they the citizens or the innocent civilians?  They were the innocent civilians who will tell you that you are in the wrong queue.  It was not the member of parliament.  So in a way they were implementing the policies of the government.  So that's - their whole policy surrounds that and hence you find that most of the time they will always talk about the whites, saying because the whites were in power and it so happened, the people who were in power were white and they will say even if it was the black people, irrespective of what.  That's why they would say that is the reason some time in the early '60s they were also attacking chiefs, because they were collaborating.  That is why they were killing black policemen, because they were part of the system.  So in a way that's how they were explaining that.  Though it may seem racist because of the colour of the skin of the people who were in the ruling class, but it was not specifically the targeted class, but they were targeted because they were the ruling class.\n\tNow those are known by the Committee, it has many a times - unfortunately this time I could not call somebody in the higher hierarchy of APLA, because of the death of one of the members of the High Command during this week, they are busy preparing for that.  I normally call somebody in the High Command to explain, for even the victims to understand, to explain how they were coming up with all those policies and the attacks.  Because at the end of the day, the applicants were just carrying out orders and they have to.  They were not the policy makers, the were people who were making those policies and who were identifying targets, though at times they were asked to select targets.\n\tNow Chairperson, having said that, we know that some of them, we talk about the hard and soft targets, I know Mr Lax you had the privilege of meeting the delegation of APLA during the Human Rights Violations, and some of them, especially Mr Fihla, who is a General now, he was almost one of the influential people in APLA and articulate and eloquent people and in most of the hearings I've been using him to explain some of these things, and he had explained some of these things of hard and soft targets, which is the reason in some instances we'd say look, we did not make any differentiation between hard and soft targets.  As far as they are concerned it's that white people, even at school who were trained how to handle a firearm, and it's not necessary to say because he's not in the Army, necessarily means that he's not military aware, he has been trained for that.  So there was a strong debate about those things.  But in any event, that was their policy.\n\tNow Chairperson, having said that, it's my submission without wasting your time, that the applicant has met all the requirements of the Act, and he has made full disclosure before this Committee, of his involvement in this incident.  Chairperson, it's clear that even the police did not have evidence against him, except what was allegedly written by Valtengua Nkanyezi, and they could not pin anything on him.  Hence, when he denied it there is nothing they can do about it, but he decided, despite that, to come forward and tell the Committee of what actually happened. \n\tChairperson, also the question of Valtengua, where he comes up and saying he was involved, Chairperson it's my submission that the version of the applicant must be accepted, because at the time when he was making his application, Valtengua was already dead, there was no reason for him to hide somebody who is dead, not to say he was involved in this operation, because he was not in any event going to answer for that.  So in a way, Chairperson, I'm trying to say that there might be something with this report which is here, though I don't have facts, but I don't see any reason because at the time the applicant was making an application, Valtengua was already dead, there was no reason for him not to say: \"I was involved with Valtengua, who is now deceased\".  And as I indicated, I tried to trace this Dawn Faku who is in Bloemfontein and I asked him about why he did not apply and he said: \"I was not involved, I don't know and I was shocked when I was told that I was involved in this incident, I had nothing to do with it.  I would have curtly have applied if I was involved in this incident.\"\n\tSo Chairperson, it's therefore my submission that at the time the applicant, inasmuch as everybody was involved in negotiations, as we all know, PAC was still involved in the armed struggle and it had not yet suspended the armed struggle.  As we know that some of these incidents continued up until 1994.  It's therefore my submission that the applicant has made full disclosure and also that when he acted he did not act for personal gain.  He did not know any of the victims which were in the bus and as he put it, there may have been members of PAC in the bus or ANC in the bus and they would have died as a result of his actions.  So Chairperson, it's therefore my submission that the applicant, in terms of the Act, has discharged the onus which is put on him on a balance of probabilities that he indeed acted on behalf of a known political organisation in the furthering of its aims and objectives, and that he made full and proper disclosure of his involvement in the incident.  And therefore, Chairperson, it's my submission that he should be granted amnesty as applied for.\n\tUnless the Committee would want me to address it on any specific point, Chairperson.",

            "Thank you, Chairperson.  I will be brief in my address and my submissions.\n\tI think what comes to the fore very clearly from the feelings of the victims is the fact that they regard the applicant's conduct, no matter what his motives were supposed to be at the time, they regard his conduct as cowardly and cruel and that they regard the deed as heinous in the circumstances.\n\tThere's no doubt that they've suffered greatly as a result of the deed and the conduct of the applicant and whoever was with him, whether psychologically or physically, it's quite clear that several people were injured quite seriously in the course of the attack, other people will have to live with this act, with what happened to them for the rest of their lives and the psychological affect of what has happened obviously cannot be measured at all.\n\tIt has become quite clear to me that the victims have a difficulty in understanding why they were subjected as being the victims of this attack, and they particularly have difficulty in accepting that because of the fact that at that particular point in time,  a date had been set for the elections and as far as they were concerned there was therefore absolutely no reason at the time for the attack to take place.\n\tThey also expressed the view, as appeared during my questioning, that the deed becomes even more cowardly because of the fact that there were innocent people, innocent children, elderly people, civilians involved and they have great difficulty in accepting what political motive or gain would be achieved by in fact attacking them.\n\tI must say, Chair, that the victims, some of them, have expressed doubt as to the sincerity of the applicant when he has in fact indicated that he asked for forgiveness for his conduct.  In fact, one of the victims indicated that they got the impression that he in fact had adopted an almost arrogant boasting attitude about his deeds and that he didn't show sufficient appreciation for in fact, the way they feel about what had happened.  And the attitude basically is that unless the applicant in some or other way shows to them during the course of these hearing, or after the hearings, unless he shows to them on a more personal level that he in fact does really have, he is really sorry and that he really seeks forgiveness and that he really is someone who is looking ahead to build up a better life towards reconciliation, as he professes, if he shows them on a personal level, then they certainly on a personal level, would be prepared to forgive him for his conduct that in fact led to this dastardly deed.\n\tThey're not prepared to in fact, condone what had happened on the particular day, from a bigger picture, but on a personal level they are prepared to in fact consider approaches on his part for forgiveness. \n\tChairperson, Committee, whether or not he has made full disclosure or not, whether or not he in fact complies with the requirements of the Act for amnesty, I'm not going to address you on that.  I've already indicated that there must be some doubt as to precisely what the motive was for the attack, bearing in mind the fact that the elections were going to take place, and unless we're dealing here with a situation as has been indicated by Mr Mbandazayo, that in fact, irrespective of what the other parties or the other people of this country were thinking at that particular time, APLA certainly had their own agenda when they decided to launch these attacks and particularly where soft targets were involved.\n\tThat is all submissions on behalf of the victims, Chair, if there's anything in particular, then I'd be glad to address the Committee.",

I would like to tell the victims that the applicant is prepared and in fact that's what he told me when we came here, that he would like - at that time we did not know, we normally after the hearing request whoever is representing the victims, to see the victims if they are willing, to talk to them at a personal level, to understand and whatever.  So in that respect, Chairperson, the applicant is willing to meet the victims.\n\tWell Chairperson, the other aspects I wouldn't like to dwell on, I think I've addressed sufficiently with regard to the question of the negotiations and it is known that at that time, and the Act is couched in such that it accommodates that what the political parties, recognised political parties at that time, was their position with regard to their operations.  So I wouldn't like to dwell on that aspect, except to say that the applicant is, it's his wish to meet the victims, those who are present.   Thank you, Chairperson.",

            "Thank you, Mr Mbandazayo.  I must just say on behalf of the Panel that, as intimated earlier to you and Mr Riley, that although reconciliation and the expression of remorse or forgiveness is not in any way a criteria to be taken into account by the Panel in deciding whether to grant or refuse amnesty, we consider the whole of reconciliation as a very important element of this whole amnesty process and if at the numerous hearings that we attend, any measure of reconciliation can be achieved, it's a good thing.  So the fact that the victims have expressed a will to speak to the applicant and the fact that the applicant has expressed a will to speak to the victims in regard to building bridges or arriving at some form of conciliation, we as Committee appreciate that and we would like to thank you all for that.\n\tWe will reserve our decision in this matter.  It's our policy to hand out written decisions and as you know we're very near the end of the process, so the decision will not be long in coming out, it should be out in the very near future.  \n\tAnd I'd like to, at this stage, express my thanks to the legal representatives for their assistance in this matter, Ms Coleridge.  \n\tAnd before we adjourn, we have been here for the last couple of weeks, I would just very much like to thank everybody who made these hearings possible.  I'd like to thank the people of the synagogue for making this very convenient and nice venue available to us.  The Sound Engineers, the Interpreters who have been working particularly hard the last couple of weeks, the TV, the media people, the caterers who have been feeding us, the caretaker here who has been looking after us so well, my Secretary, Ms Coleridge, everybody.  If I've left out anybody's name, I have not done so with any personal spite or malice, and I thank you very much.  We shall now adjourn.",
