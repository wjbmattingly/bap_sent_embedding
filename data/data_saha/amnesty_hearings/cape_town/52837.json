Whatever the reason was, valuable time has been lost and inconvenience has been caused to a number of people apart from just the Members of the Committee.  If anything can be done to avoid loss of time such as this, in future we've got to try and do that and avoid unnecessary waste of time.\n\tWell for the time being I think I have said enough in that regard.  Just to once again say that I am thoroughly disappointed that we weren't able to make a beginning.\n\tWhat is the position this morning?  Mr Fortuin?",
