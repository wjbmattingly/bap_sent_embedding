This venue is really inaccessible to the victims and to the community of Kewtown itself.\n\tMr Chairperson, I just want to say that the bombing incident in Kewtown had wider implications in the community, or for the Kewtown community.  The community became divided as a result of that incident because local gangsters or local community members were used to destabilise the community and as a result of that, people who associated with these people, were treated with suspicion by the victims or other members of the community.\n\tThis is the one chance to address those deep-rooted divisions which arose as a result of, directly as a result of this incident.  I would have expected the TRC to choose a venue that is more accessible, it need not necessarily be the Early Learning Centre itself, but there are other suitable venues.  I understand from Ms Coleridge that most of the legal representatives of the applicants had no, in principle, objection to the Hewitt Training College, except Mr Slang van Zyl or his legal representative.\n\tMr Chairperson, I get the impression that any venue is okay, as long as it is in a so-called white area, irrespective of the fact that more bombs had been detonated in this area and surrounding areas than had been the case in Kewtown or surrounding areas, Mr Chairperson.\n\tI will ask the Committee to seriously reconsider this venue and to see whether it is at all possible to get the Hewitt Training College, to enable victims and the community to participate in these proceedings.

It says that the original venue was not available, which we accept, but I want to read the rest of the letter, and I think that the Committee and we and our clients are entitled to an explanation as to whether these decisions are made as a prerogative of Mr van Zyl and his legal representative.\n\"... We are aware of the strong opposition raised at the amnesty hearing by Mr Martini the legal representative of Mr van Zyl, to the change of venue, ie 7th floor, 106 Adderley Street, Cape Town.  On 29th May 2000, the writer attempted to conduct a telephonic conversation with the said Attorney, informing him of the developments in the matter.  From the outset of the conversation, he refused to communicate to the writer to the extent of him refusing any future telephonic conversation.  Mr du Plessis, representing Mr Burger, Mr Maree, Mr Basson, Mr Barnard and Mr Alex Bosman representing Gen Verster have indicated to the writer that they are not opposed to the change of the venue.  We wish to point out that the order, by consent in the High Court application in the case of Slang van Zyl  v Truth and Reconciliation Commission states that the TRC \"is interdicted from proceeding or continuing with the amnesty hearing in so far as the applicant is concerned, from the 13th of March to the 17th of March, pending the relocation of the venue.\"  The venue referred to in the said order is the Athlone Learning Centre.  Find annexed here to a copy of the order, by consent marked Annexure B.\nThe letter continues -\n\"... In the spirit of reconciliation, we reiterate the words of the Honourable Justice Miller in response to Mr Martini.  'We are aware that there has been a decision made, but I am also fully aware of the anxiety of the victims, and a change of venue I can assure you would be done in consultation with yourselves.  It is just done in honest endeavour to get something that is more convenient and more acceptable, for all the people.'  Find annexed hereto a copy of pages 763 to 764 of the transcript, marked Annexure C.  We await your urgent response, confirmation to the issue of the said venue by not later than 14H00, Thursday, 1st of June 2000.\"\n\tNow Mr Chairman, what is this power that Mr Martini and Mr van Zyl Slabbert purport to have?",

            "Thank you Chairperson.  Just from the Commission's side, Chairperson, we have attempted as the letter of the 30th stated.  Initially we had the Hewitt College, Chairperson, and your last instructions were that we reach consensus on the issue of the venue.\n\tI, the only person to date Chairperson, that raised the opposition, was Mr Slang van Zyl and his legal representative, Mr Martini, acting on his behalf.  The Commission attempted to liaise with Mr Martini, he refused to speak to me, Chairperson, as the Evidence Leader on that particular date, and therefore he said, you know, just to get all correspondence, etc, in writing, which I therefore had done, I did that, that was the letter of the 30th.  I then circulated the letter to all the legal representatives.\n\tAt the outset, Chairperson, I attempted to speak to Mr Martini, just to get consensus whether he agreed to the venue or not and then we were forced in a sense, Chairperson, to communicate to everybody that we have this venue, which we rightfully were to do, which we did, and still Chairperson, Mr Slang van Zyl and Mr Martini raised the opposition.\n\tThe TRC, we were involved in the application, the High Court application and we just want to inform the victims Chairperson, that we did vehemently oppose that application and that we are aware of the rights of the victims, but in every attempt that the TRC had made in liaising and communicating with Mr Slag van Zyl's Attorneys, we got strong opposition, and in all instances Chairperson, he threatened legal action once again.\n\tOn the basis, the only basis, was that his client feared for his life.  The position of the Commission is, Chairperson, that we do have a limited lifespan and we have to take  note of that.  We are attempting to complete all matters by July/August Chairperson, and it is unfortunate that we have this limited lifespan, that we cannot entertain and oppose this as the Commission would have wanted to.\n\tDue to that factor, we thought that to speed up and expedite this matter, we would have it here, just to get Mr Slang van Zyl here and to hear his evidence, Chairperson, which the victims are entitled to hear.\n\tThat is the position of the Commission.  We have attempted to do everything in our powers.  Thank you Chairperson.",

            "Well, I suppose Mr Commissioner, I would have to address this.  I thought this issue was long gone but unfortunately it seems to raise its head again.\n\tI didn't want to get involved in this debate, Mr Commissioner, but however, I think we need to place correct facts before this Commission, particularly since Mr Bizos selectively, and it seems to be the tendency here, to record only certain things.\n\tI have to address Mr Coleridge because unfortunately there are attacks on myself as a legal representative and my client.  Well, first of all, we don't profess to exert any power.  What we do have, is a Court order.  We followed the justice process and the justice process agreed with my client.  That issue has been decided.\n\tWhat we find remarkable, Mr Commissioner, is if you recall these proceedings were adjourned on the 17th of March.  The issue of the venue was an issue, it was an issue that went to the High Court of the Cape Province and an order was granted.  The issue raised its head again at the hearings, and there was a lot of debate at these hearings.  I think unnecessarily so, however, it keeps raising its head.  What then happens,  Mr Commissioner, and unfortunately I will have to read a letter into the record, because Mr Bizos supported by Ms Coleridge, chose to address their letter, read their letter into the record.  \n\tWhat we find remarkable is these hearings terminated on the 17th of March, the issue of the venue was an issue.  The first time we ever hear from the Commission was on the 1st of June.  The Commission, represented at this stage of state, through Ms Coleridge, knew the Athlone area was an issue and that issue was fully ventilated in Court papers in the High Court, so I need not  delve in that again.\n\tBut at the late stage as to the 1st of June, no attempts were made to even try and attempt to accommodate my client's concern.  What we get is a letter saying and I put on record, a distorted letter \"there is a venue in Athlone\", no attempts made to accommodate my client's concern.\n\tNow it becomes important to read my reply because I think I must also put this on record, there seems to be a personal attack on me as a legal representative, I am here doing a job, protecting my client, and I will do my job to the best of my ability.   I will protect my client's rights where possible.  Now, we have read, and what is going to be significant, Mr Commissioner, is we have never got a reply to this very important letter.\n\tMs Coleridge addresses me a letter on the 30th of May, it is dated the 30th of May, it is telefaxed to my office on the 31st of May.  Mr Bizos has read it into the record.  What is important is that we place my reply on behalf of my client, into the record so we get the truth before this Commission.\n\tI write, acting on behalf of my client -\n\"... We refer to your telefax, 31st of May, telefaxed at 15H04.  The writer takes exception to your unfounded remarks.  You have had months to address your aforesaid letter to the writer, however, you choose to telefax it on the date and time aforesaid and arrogantly demand a reply by 14H00 on the 1st of June.\"\n\tMr Commissioner, Ms Coleridge had since the 17th of March, she writes a letter on the 31st at approximately four minutes passed three, and demands a reply the next day on a sensitive issue.  I carry on to quote from my letter, Mr Commissioner -\n\"... The writer will arrange to consult with our client and thereafter revert to you at our earliest opportunity on the issue of the venue.  At this stage our failure to respond fully to you, mustn't be construed as admission.  For the record, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission has already determined the venue, namely 7th floor, Adderley Street.\"\n\tThat was the venue that was allocated after the Court order.   Be that as it may, the last paragraph - I continue to quote, Mr Commissioner -\n\"... the last paragraph of your aforesaid letter is certainly not a recordal of the true facts.  The writer was certainly not rude to your Ms Coleridge, as alleged, or at all.   The writer informed your Ms Coleridge, in order to avoid any misunderstandings, that she  should address the writer in writing on the issue of the venue.  The only person who was rude, was your Ms Coleridge, who summarily replaced the received to answer her cellular phone, that was ringing.\"\n\tI have to put this on the record, because Ms Coleridge chose to give evidence now.  \n\"... The writer certainly did not demand that you  refrain from any future telephonic communications with the writer.  Such statement is a blatant distortion of the truth.   The writer reiterates that he advised your Ms Coleridge that she should address the issue of the venue in writing, in order to avoid any misunderstandings.  Since your Ms Coleridge distorts the true content of telephonic discussions, it would now be advisable to liaise with the writer in writing.  We would suggest that your Ms Coleridge refrain from unwarranted and untruthful personal attacks on the writer.  One can however, understand your Ms Coleridge's personal emotions, which can only be ascribed to her past high handed decision - (we refer to her past emotive comments to the press) - which was proved to be incorrect and costly for the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and taxpayers of this country.  In this regard we refer you to the High Court order which included an order for costs against the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.  We request that your Ms Coleridge put her emotions aside and act in a reasonable and mature manner, without embarking upon further unwarranted and untruthful personal attacks on the writer.  The venue was not only the Athlone Learning Centre, possibly your Ms Coleridge should read our client's affidavits carefully.  Significantly the recordal of the Honourable Justice Miller's comments is also selective.  We will complete your \"selective recordal of such comments\" ...\"\n\tMr Commissioner, I pause here.  This is in relation to Ms Coleridge and relating to the comments Mr Commissioner made at the end of the hearing -\n\"... people, and there won't be anything done that will catch you by surprise, it will be done by consensus, hopefully with all parties concerned.  Can we leave it at that?\"\n\tMs Coleridge in her letter selectively chose Mr Commissioner's comments of the last hearing, I just completed it for her.  For the record, this debate only took place at the end of the evidence as a result of a specific request by the Honourable Min Omar, through Adv Bizos.     This was not suggested mero motu by the Commissioner.\n\tVery important now, Mr Commissioner -\n\"... We assume that your letter seeks our client's consent to the venue referred in your aforesaid letter.  Before we formally reply to your aforesaid letter, we require the following information ...\"\n\tand significantly Mr Commissioner, it still hasn't been forthcoming -\n\"... as from which date did the Truth and Reconciliation Commission become aware that the 7th floor, 106 Adderley Street, would be occupied from the 1st of June 2000, by whom is the 7th floor allegedly occupied, is it occupied in terms of Annexure A to your aforesaid letter, if not, please let us have a copy of the relevant document.  When was Annexure A to your aforesaid letter, signed?  Precisely where is the Athlone Technical College situated, is it in Athlone or the city centre?  When was the venue secured by Ms Martin?  Was your Ms Coleridge authorised by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to address and record the content of your aforesaid letter to the writer?\"\n\tI pause there, Mr Commissioner.  To date, I haven't had a reply to that letter, but it will be important to place another letter on record.  \n\"... Please let us have the aforesaid information as soon as possible, so that we may have such information at hand when we consult with our client, in order to address you fully and issuably on the issue of the venue.\"\n\tNo reply.   Bearing in mind, my client was given until two o'clock the next day to reply.  \n\"... Please note that should any decision once again be taken unilaterally, without our client's consensus, our client reserves his rights to approach the High Court for a leave, if necessary.\"\n\tNothing wrong with that.  \n\"... In the interim, all our rights are reserved.\"\n\tWhat then happens Mr Commissioner, is I believe this letter came to the attention of the Chief Executive Officer of the TRC and they asked Ms Coleridge no longer to deal with me on this issue, and an Adv Prior liaised with me.",

            "Mr Chairperson, if I may finish, Adv Prior communicates with me telephonically, I have no problem with Mr Prior and he writes to me, he says\n\"... We wish to confirm (this is on the 2nd of June) that according to the Supervisor of 106 Adderley Street, Cape Town, and the letting agents, Golding Commercial Properties, Cape Town, the 7th floor is not available to the TRC.  This can be confirmed by Debby McCullum, the letting agent, cellphone number 0829211244.  In the circumstances, the TRC has secured a suitable alternative venue for the forthcoming hearing, at the Freeman Centre, Cnr Main - and Upper Portswood Roads, Greenpoint.  The venue meets with the various criteria of the TRC for the holding of such public hearings, and it is a short distance outside the city bowl.  Would you kindly advise us of your client's attitude towards this arrangement.\"\n\tNow Mr Commissioner, I get no reply from the Truth Commission to my letters in order to address the issue of Athlone, no reply to my letter.  It still hasn't come.  Mr Prior communicates with me and now he suggests another venue, which we accept.  The next letter becomes important Mr Chairperson, and I am sorry we have to go through this painstakingly, but it has been raised again and it has to be placed on the record.   All right -\n\"... We refer to your letter the 30th of May and the 31st and the writer's subsequent telephonic discussions with Adv Prior.  (This is a letter from my office, addressed to Adv Prior on the 2nd of June)  Please note that our client still holds the same concerns as regards Athlone as a venue, as was dealt with previously.  In addition, our client's submissions as regards altering the venue to Athlone are on record.  Our client does not accept the venue in Athlone as said on your letter of the 30th of May, for reasons which need not be elaborated upon at this stage, in view of the new venue.  Our client has instructed us to advise that he is prepared to accept the new venue, namely Freeman Centre, Cnr Main Road & Upper Portswood Road, Greenpoint as set out in your letter of the 2nd of June.  Notwithstanding our client's acceptance of the new venue, our client insists that adequate and proper security be in place at such venue.  In this regard, the writer confirms having advised Adv Prior that after the hearings terminated on the 17th of March the following occurred - a certain Mr Mark Bishop, approached Capt Benade of the Security Unit and requested to see our client urgently.  Capt Benade took this gentleman up to a room with our client.  Capt Benade duly  frisked this gentleman to ensure that he had no firearms.  The gentleman then requested Capt Benade to leave the room, which he duly did.  This gentleman advised our client of a plot to attempt to assassinate our client, whilst he was at the amnesty hearings.   Our client has reported this incident to the authorities.  Whilst our client is appreciative that this may be a prank, alternatively a publicity seeker, our client nevertheless regard such incidents in a serious light and as a serious threat to his safety and security. Accordingly, notwithstanding, our client has accepted the venue at the Freeman Centre, Main Road & Upper Portswood Road, Greenpoint, Cape Town.  We would request that proper and adequate security be in place at such venue for the entire duration of the proceedings.\"\nNext point -\n\"... Kindly confirm that the hearings will now take place at the Freeman Centre, Upper Portswood Road, Greenpoint, Cape Town, that proper, adequate security will be in placed at such venue, more particularly in view of what is stated herein.  Finally (and for the record) writer spoke to Debbie McCullum, that is the agent, I was invited to speak to, this afternoon as suggested in your letter. She confirmed to the writer that (1) apparently a month ago the Department of Finance took occupation of a section of the 7th floor, Adderley Street, namely the offices to the right side after entering the double glass doors; (2) the section, namely the open area which was utilised by the public to watch the televised proceedings and the actual hall in which the proceedings took place on the last occasion, together with all the offices to the left of the glass doors, is unoccupied.  She did advise however that they are presently in negotiations with the Unions to occupy this vacant space, although no agreement for occupation has yet been concluded.  The writer also discussed this with the Building Manager, Mr Carl Kiefer, who confirmed the aforesaid.  From the aforesaid discussions, it is apparent to the writer who is aware of the premises having attended at the same, that the venue is available, save for the portion to the right which on the last occasion, was utilised as a press room.  Be that as it may, our client accepts the venue in Greenpoint, subject to proper and adequate security being in place as aforestated.\"\n\tSo Mr Chairperson, what we have here is no replies by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to my enquiries of the venue.  Notwithstanding that the Truth and Reconciliation were aware of this issue since the 17th of March, that letter has still not been addressed.\n\tWhat we also have is the agents and Building Manager of the TRC building, confirming that the 7th floor is still available.  So one asks the question \"what is going on\", Mr Commissioner.  But the fact remains, Adv Prior was given the mandate to deal with the venue, notified us of another venue which we accepted and we are here, and we hope that this issue of the venue is at an end now.\n\tUnfortunately I see that there is not many members of the public in the gallery.   As the Judge in the court case, the order, the interdict stated, he sees no problem for people of the Athlone community coming out to venues which isn't at a distance from Athlone.  In fact Mr Commissioner, if you have to have reference to the affidavits, the TRC provides in a budget for transportation of victims to the venue.  So what is the problem? \n\tBut I don't want to get embroiled in that dispute, it has been ventilated by a Court of law, we sincerely want to get on with the hearings and not waste time.\n\tTo reply to Mr Williams, it is significant what Mr Williams had to say to day, it was never placed on record before, this division of the community in Athlone.  Why suddenly two months later, has this now, we hear this for the first time, that this bombing divided the community?  Mr Commissioner, let's get on with the purpose that we are here, we are at a new venue, we have accepted this venue, a decision has been taken and let's get on with it.  Let's not waste time, taxpayers' money and let's get on with these hearings.  Thank you Mr Commissioner.",

Chairperson, the Commission takes exception to the fact that Mr Martini is now saying that we never, ever responded to him regarding his letters that he addressed to us.\n\tThe fact of the matter is that our Legal Officer, Adv Paddy Prior, took the matter further and actually did liaise with Mr Martini and therefore we are here today Chairperson, in order to get consensus from them, which they accepted Chairperson.  The fact that he is stating the Commission never replied to him, we do take exception to that.\n\tAnd then just on the issue of the victims as well,  Chairperson, in relation to transport.  We do provide victims' transport, but the Commission, it has more to do with the community at large, that I think Mr Williams was referring to.

What I told Ms Coleridge, she phoned me, Mr Commissioner, she chose to phone me on a landline and then answered her cellphone rudely and then put the phone down.  If we are going, I don't want to get into this debate, Mr Commissioner, but it attacks my professional integrity and if she's put that in a letter, I take exception to that and I just want to clear the record.

I am not aware of the present availability of any other venues, but I think it would probably be in the interests of all of us, if perhaps during the tea interval or maybe the lunch interval, if we could speak to the legal representatives, with the Panel and see if we can finally sort out this matter.\n\tI would at the same time, like to say that this actual venue that we are in now, has been made available to the Commission and we appreciate the fact that we are here.  I was under the impression that the whole of the 7th floor was not available, in any event, that wasn't a convenient venue, as convenient, or suitable as this.\n\tBut as I said earlier, we are fully aware of the views of the victims, not only the victims, but of the community in Athlone.  Perhaps if we can talk it through during a tea interval, we might be able to come up with some solution.  But I would appreciate it if we could proceed with the evidence, as Ms Coleridge said, our time in the Commission is getting limited now and our prime concern is to finish matters as soon as possible, but obviously we are not going to be roughshod and let undue haste in any way tarnish the quality of the proceedings.\n\tWould that be acceptable then, if we could speak about this later, off the record, and try to arrive at some conclusion?  We've got two weeks here.  If it is possible, I don't know, if it is at all, to change a venue, if we can agree to do so, maybe we can.

On occasion, when the accused was in the Cape, busy with the monitoring of Omar, he contacted her and supplied a Cape Town telephone number to her which she had to call.  She had to, using a fictitious name, arrange an appointment to speak to Dullah Omar.  She had to determine in this manner where Omar was and what his movements were.  After he had on occasion returned from Cape Town, the accused informed her that he waited in the garage next to the vehicle of Dullah Omar, for him to come out and he wanted to shoot him then.  He said that he had a weapon with a silencer with him and the accused said that he aborted the plan, because a woman, something that he did not expect, appeared with Omar and climbed into the car with Omar.\"\n\tOkay.  Now, that is where the Judge is summarising the evidence.  Later on, let's turn to where the Judge makes his finding at page 229.  Mr van Zyl, maybe you can save my voice, just read what the Judge finds there under the heading \"Aanklag 2\".\nMR VAN ZYL\n\"... It is clear from the evidence which is common cause, that the charge of conspiracy to murder, has been proven.   We are actually of the opinion that the evidence proves beyond reasonable doubt that the accused's handling has already gone so far, that it can be seen as an attempt.  It is the case that the evidence of van Zyl, Slang van Zyl, shows that the accused person did not commit the murder, but that Peaches Gordon would get other people to do it.  He testifies that the accused person only had to do the monitoring of Omar, but we can actually not agree with the State that van Zyl's evidence in this aspect, must necessarily be rejected.  It is not necessarily clashing with the admittance that the accused person would have made to Brenda.  It is quite possibly the case that the accused person wanted to elevate his status with the CCB and it is insightful that the accused person, at some stage, indeed did have a Makarov pistol with a silencer in his possession.  We are satisfied that Brenda's evidence about the statement that the accused had made, can be accepted.  According to  the statement, he was outside the house with the weapon and he wanted to shoot Omar and we are satisfied that the accused person had the intention to commit murder and that this act of his can already been seen as an executed handling, and therefore he is found guilty on the charge of attempted murder.\"",
