<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you, you may be seated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR PRIOR:</span> Mr Cerqueira, is it correct that on the evening of the 30th of December 1993, you were at the Machados Restaurant in Observatory?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> Yes, I was, I was the whole day until a quarter to twelve that evening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Who was the owner of the restaurant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> My brother, my brother Jose.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Could you tell the Commission or the Committee what occurred at between approximately 11H30 and midnight on that evening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> Yes.  We were about to leave, my brother was standing behind the bar counter and I was standing on the opposite side towards the door when he asked me to take the key and open up the next morning.  I know the doors were open and the restaurant was empty, there were no patrons in the restaurant.  For some reason or other I turned back and I saw this vehicle drive past slowly past the restaurant - look inside, the car was heavy laden.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Just stop there.  You say a vehicle drove past the restaurant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> Yes, it actually slowed down to the door where the door was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Now, the Machados Restaurant is situated where in Observatory?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> It's situated two doors from the Heidelberg Tavern.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And how far from the corner of Station Road and Main Road?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> We're on the corner Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Is that at the robots?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> At the robots.  The car slowed down, I noticed there was a driver wearing - I think wearing glasses, squared faced - drove up to the top and with about three minutes from noticing that we got talking and we heard what sounded to us or to myself as firecrackers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> At that stage, were you still inside the Machados Restaurant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> We were still inside.  The one waiter had started walking towards the door and told me - his name was Benny, he told me that it sounded like crackers.  I followed the waiter to the door, another waiter followed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Did you go outside onto the pavement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> I went onto the pavement, Benny the waiter was standing in front of me looking towards the Heidelberg Tavern, in other words right of the restaurant.  There was another waiter in front of me and I was the third person on the pavement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Mr Chairman, could the translator just give me an indication when to proceed, I don't know when the translation ends.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a>	Please continue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> What sounded like crackers seemed to be more sort of repetitive - I actually thought it was a car's exhaust being dragged going gr, gr, like that ...[indistinct]  When I looked up there was that same car which was a dark car, it was coming in the opposite direction - that being a one-way going up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Was this vehicle - this dark coloured vehicle travelling towards you at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> Towards us which is in the opposite direction of a one-way - it seemed very strange to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Sorry, is Station Road a one-way going up towards ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> Going up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Sorry, from Main Road?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> No, it's going up from the stadium up towards the hospital, it's a one-way going up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And this vehicle was travelling against the one-way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> Against the one-way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Yes, what did you observe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> I observed the guy in the back seat of the car - there was what I believe was a R4 or an R1, I don't know what you call these things now, or an AK47 through the window ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> What did you see?  Could you identify anything at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> They were shooting - there was a guy shooting towards the right of the car and another guy shooting sort of in the air towards the restaurant above at random, they were just shooting.  Then they turned the gun - they guy on the left turned the gun towards where we were standing, fired a couple of shots, hit the wall next to where the waiter was standing, the waiter froze, I dragged the waiter inside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Who was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> Benny.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Are you able to tell the Committee, how far was this vehicle from you when the shots or shots were directed at you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> About as far as what you are from me now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...[inaudible]</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> About ten to twelve paces Mr Chairman, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a>	You say you dragged Benny inside?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> Yes, I caught a hell of a fright obviously, people were shooting at us.  I dragged Benny inside, there was another waiter - the three of us went through the door and I went inside shouting for my brother, shouting for him:  "Where are you, where's the gun, where's your gun"?  I dived over the counter looking for the gun, I didn't see my brother, went into the kitchen asking for the staff "Where's my brother"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> Benny as well went in screaming for my brother, asking for my brother.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Penny?</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> Benny.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Oh, Benny.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> The waiter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Yes, then what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> Then I got a funny gut feeling for not finding my brother.  I walked towards the door again and when I got outside he was shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Are you okay to continue?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> Yes, I'm fine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Yes, what was the next thing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> When I got to him he was laying there, I was hoping that his legs were shot but he had been shot underneath his left arm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Did you see whether he had a firearm in his possession?</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> No, Sir.  This is what he had in his hand, this is what he had in his hand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> It is a pouch Sir, where he kept all his documents and where he kept the store keys in there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Did you stay with your brother the deceased, until the police arrived?</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> Yes, I did.  I stayed with my brother and I took his gold chain off him and then Benny took his watch off him until the police arrived.  And then Benny brought me my brother's gun which he evidently found afterwards - I don't know where.  The police asked me if the gun had been shot, I said: "No, test it for yourself".  They took the gun and they tested it ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Sorry, just stop there.  What type of firearm was it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> It's a .45, a .45 Parabellum or Star, I'm not sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> A semi-automatic?</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Can you tell the Committee, as far as you know - you were there on the pavement at a certain stage, whether your brother the deceased fired at this vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> No Sir, not to my knowledge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> The exhibit that you've tendered, the leather pouch - you say he kept his documents in there and the shop keys?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> Shop keys, documents.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Did he normally take it home with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> Yes.  And the gun he carried underneath - he kept underneath the till point at all times.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> I just want to clear up one aspect, when you noticed this vehicle coming towards you, you say there was shooting from both sides - sorry, let me correct that, you saw shooting towards the opposite side of Heidelberg Tavern?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And you say that was random?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And the side of the vehicle that shot at - sorry, the person that shot at you where you were standing, where did that shooting come from, from ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> From the back of the vehicle on the left-hand side.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> You said earlier something: "It was R1's or R4's or AK47's, are you able to describe with any precision what the firearms were that were being used on that evening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> Not with any precision.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> But were they small short weapons or were they long?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> They had longer barrels than my usual gun that I use, I'd say they were rifles.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Rifles?  Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR PRIOR</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Arendse?</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Cerqueira, as the legal representatives of the applicants and for the applicants, we are sorry to know that your brother was killed in the incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> Sorry, could you speak up, I can't hear you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> Yes, we are sorry - the legal representatives and the applicants and it's really tragic and as legal representatives we are not here to defend or to justify what happened that evening, do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> I understand that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> Has it been explained to you by Mr Prior or anyone else what this process is about - this amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> I've been following it quite closely on TV.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> But do you know ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> I've been reading the newspaper and I know what this is all about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> Okay.  Are you opposed to these three applicants being granted amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> Very much so, I am.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> Now if you are opposed, on what basis are you opposing the applications?</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> Because up until this stage I didn't want - all I wanted to do and my family wanted to was to forget the whole thing, until I heard what these gentlemen were coming up with - about the shooting at them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> That my brother was shooting at them or to that effect that my brother carried a weapon and pointed at them or whatever they're saying, then I decided I'll get involved now.  Up until that point I was quite prepared to forget the whole thing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> But you were also prepared to forget it because they had been tried and convicted and sentenced, so they'd been stuck away for - in their case, 27 years so on that basis you were prepared to forget about it, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> Not on those basis', I was prepared to forget so that my whole family could put everything behind it - this sentence to me means nothing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> But you must have then been satisfied that the perpetrators or at least some of them had been apprehended and had gone to court and they'd been found guilty and sentenced?</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> If you call somebody that takes another person's life and sits for 20 years and then can come out and - I don't want to sound as if I'm accusing anybody but if you call that justice, to me it's not justice.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> Sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Mr Chairman, I requested the policemen's - I wanted to examine the bag just to - while I have an opportunity.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> May I continue Mr Chairman?  Would it be correct to say that what want is justice?</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> That's quite correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> And justice for you would have been - you would have preferred them to get the death penalty, would that have been justice for you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> At that time when I saw my brother lying there obviously one expects the same from whoever does that, takes a loved one away from you and up until about a year ago sure, I wanted the death sentence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> Now, that's why I asked you whether this process has been explained to you.   Do you know what the difference is between this amnesty hearing -  this process and the criminal process?</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> Yes.  They've been charged, they've been found guilty and they've got 20 odd years what you mentioned, I understand that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> And that ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> This is now - they want amnesty so they can walk in the streets again, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> No, it's not correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> Okay, would you explain to me then please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> Now, let's examine that.  The criminal court is about justice okay, where people are found - they're brought before the court, they're tried, evidence is let and on that evidence you are found guilty or not guilty.  In their case they were found guilty and they were sentenced, now that is justice.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> Okay I understand, please carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> Now do you understand this process that it's not the same as the criminal process?</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> Could you please elaborate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think he said that he knows now they're applying for amnesty and if they get it they'll be free - he said that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> Well, I'm not sure whether the answer came out that way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a>	I still want you to understand because it is of concern to us as legal representatives that as a victim it doesn't appear from what you say that it has been explained to you what this process is all about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> Well, it seems to me that I don't really understand, so will you please explain it to me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> You seem to be very cynical that where someone applies for amnesty and is granted amnesty that they can as you put it, go and walk the streets.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> What is this all about then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> Well, maybe you tell me.  You are now giving evidence here today, you've been asked to give evidence as a witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He's given you what his understanding ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> And you're opposing this ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He's given you what his understanding is Mr Arendse, if you think he ought to have a better understanding, put it to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> I want to put it to you and the other victims who intend testifying, if they can also hear what I'm saying, that this process is not about justice.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> What is it about Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> This is about this Committee hearing the truth of what happened that night and it's about reconciliation, do you believe in reconciliation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> I believe in reconciliation and I believe in the truth and therefore I've just given the statement that I did and that is the truth, that is the truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> What do you mean by you believe in reconciliation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> I want to hear - that's the reason why I came here today, I want to hear what the gentleman sitting who - one of these gentlemen sitting here that shot my brother has got to say to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> And if - I don't think - I haven't seen you here before today.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> No, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> Now they've had an opportunity and they've already said what happened that night and Mr Gqomfa who's sitting on your far right there, he has said that he shot your brother.  Is there anything more that you wanted to hear?</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> I want to know what he felt like shooting my brother and why is he saying or whoever is saying it - maybe the three I don't know I haven't heard, why my brother shot back at them - that's what I want to hear, that's why I'm here today. Up until that time that I heard these statements I wasn't interested in coming here because like you say justice had been done, this is not a court hearing.  I wasn't interested in coming here until I heard these lies.</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> Are you saying he's lying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> Yes, I'm saying he's lying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> Now you tell me, why would he be lying if he's admitted shooting your brother?  What has he got to gain by lying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> He's admitted, he hasn't lied about shooting my brother, he's lying about my brother shooting at him or having a weapon or pointing it at him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> We'll deal with that but in that situation your brother had something in his hand - you've showed it to us, he may have been under the impression that your brother was shooting at him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> So, if somebody's holding a bag you normally shoot at him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> I'm just asking the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> I'm saying he may have been under that impression, do you agree with that - in that situation that he was in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> I don't know, I'm still dumbfounded why he shot at my brother.  In fact at why he shot at all of us, I could have taken the bullet, Benny my waiter could have taken, Michael the other waiter could have taken the bullet and I could have taken the bullet but it so happens that my brother took the bullet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> Yes.  Now just to get back to an understanding of what this process is about, are you also saying that if you come here and you hear why they shot your brother - what motivated them to shoot your brother, that you would then be satisfied?</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> Sorry, could you repeat that please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> Would you be satisfied if you came here and heard from them directly who shot your brother, why they shot your brother and so on, that you would then be satisfied?</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> I'm satisfied with who shot my brother because the courts have found him guilty, what I'm not satisfied with Sir is that why he's saying that my brother was shooting back at him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> That's what I'm not satisfied about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> So if you get a plausible explanation about why he thinks your brother shot back at him, would you then be satisfied with that explanation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> I might change my mind.</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> You might change your mind?</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> If it's explained to me, yes I might Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> Now tell me, would you change your mind about your opposition to this amnesty application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> I beg your pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> Are you saying that you would consider then changing your mind whether they should be granted amnesty or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> I'd consider but it ...[indistinct] hearing what they have to say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> Now, just to get back to this process, you know that this process results from an Act of Parliament, our new Parliament?</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> And you are a law abiding citizen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> I am, I'd like to think so, I might have skipped a couple of robots or not stopped at a stop street but other than that ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> Yes.  Now, you know there are certain requirements for the applicants to meet and to satisfy before they are granted amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> Sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> Do you know what they are?</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> You don't know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> Now, if I tell you that not one of those requirements has got anything to do with justice, would you be surprised to hear that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> I probably would be, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> Now I'm telling you that it's got nothing to do with justice as you understand it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> Now, if there's such a law which allows for the applicants to be granted amnesty which has got nothing to do or very little to do with justice, would you be prepared to live by a decision of this Committee which says: "Okay, you can now - as you put it, go and walk the streets"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> I'd have to live by it Sir, I'd have to live by that and I'll probably change my mind once I've heard what is to be said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> That's why I'm here today, I'm here to hear the reason why he says and why is the perception like you said, of why - because he had something in his hand, why he got shot at?  Why does the man think because he had something in his hand he was shooting at him - if he was shooting at him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> Is there any reason why you weren't here from the beginning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> Yes, because I wanted to get it over and done with, I didn't want to - it disrupted my whole life completely, my family life.</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> Because it's a ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> My parents' lives and all our lives, his wife, his children -  the business went to pieces because of this, we wanted to forget it.  Once we heard that they had been charged the family was quite happy, up until now when I heard about what was being said and I decided how can this be?</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> Would you accept that lots and lots of people, tens of thousands if not millions of people in this country have been shot and killed and tortured ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> Sir, I understand that, we're dealing with my brother at the moment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> No, no, can we finish?</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> I'm dealing with my brother.</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> Yes, we're going to deal with your brother.  Do you accept that lots of people, many thousands of people have been shot and killed and maimed and tortured and raped - Black people in this country, do you accept that as a fact?</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> I accept that, I accept that White people, Coloured people, Indian people have been shot and raped and maimed and bombs have been planted - not only Black people, White people, Black people.  That's besides the point, my whole thing is that I came here today is to hear why these gentlemen are saying that my brother shot at them.  I'm not interested who's got shot and who that, I fell sorry for them and I understand that a lot of people did and a lot of bad things were done but this is not what the whole point is about - why I came here, why I came here today.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> But unfortunately Mr Cerqueira, what I want you to agree with me or you can disagree, is that the amnesty process is about healing all that, it's not just about your brother, I can't agree with you that this process is just about your brother. It's - we all obviously know that other people had been killed in this incident, other people had been injured in this incident, Mr Cornelius, Mr January and other people had been killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a>	It's not just about your brother, it's about trying to get to grips with understanding why all these people including your brother and other hundreds and thousands of people have been killed, injured, maimed.  Isn't that what this is about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> Sir, this is what this is about but isn't it also true that some people heal a lot quicker than others, a lot of people forgive and others don't and other people forget and others don't because we are human.  It might take me a lot longer than some people and I respect that, if other people heal quicker than what I do, then I appreciate that.  I tried to forget it up until two days ago and then yesterday I heard it again.  I wasn't going to come here but then when I heard what was being said I thought I better come here and tell the truth, basically how it happened - that's basically it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> Now, do you also accept that there have been other people who have appeared before this Committee who have committed similar or even worse atrocities and they have been granted amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> I understand that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Mr Chairman with respect, is this a fair question to the witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It hasn't got anything to do with it - as to what the Committee has decided or not Mr Arendse.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> Mr Chairman with due respect, this is of critical importance here to understand ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, it isn't of critical importance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> To understand - we haven't led any evidence, I can't say it because I'm not a witness, I need to get a response from a witness and it's clear that Mr Prior has not - as the leader of evidence he has not discussed with Mr Cerqueira and therefore I'll be surprised if he discussed it with any of the other victims, what the amnesty process is all about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Do we need to be told that by witnesses?  Don't we know what it's about, don't you know what it's about and aren't you going to tell us that in your closing address?</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> It's also important Mr Chairman with due respect, for victims to understand what this process is about before because they are opposing the application for amnesty.  Now, you support something or you oppose something because you understand it or because someone has told you to oppose or to support - that is what I want to know, his view of why he's opposing it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Arendse, as I understand his view is that he wasn't interested in coming here until recently when he heard it being said that his brother was killed because his brother was alleged to have shot at them and that is why he was killed. Now him his mind he knows that his brother did not shoot and he's come to the conclusion that they are not telling the truth, that is why he is here - I think you understand that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> I hear yes, yes, yes, behind me Mr Chairman, I asked you yesterday that people behind me must refrain from passing comments when I'm busy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...[inaudible]</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> M Chairman, that may be one of the purposes why he's here but there is a perception and that perception comes from people like Mr Cerqueira and victims who are concerned with the amnesty process, creating perception in the minds of the public about the amnesty process and in my view it is a misconception.</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a>	There is no understanding of what this is about and I can't cross-examine members of the public willingly, I can only do so when I ask questions of people like Mr Cerqueira.  And it's very important for us in this country to understand what this is about.  There is a perception that people like the applicants especially APLA cadres should not be granted amnesty, they must get their just deserts.  Now I'm putting that in context, there's been a lot of killing and the Black people of this country has borne the brunt of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We've heard that Mr Arendse, I'm just saying to you that this witness was prepared to overlook and come to terms with the reality as I understand his evidence and the only reason why he's here is because he read it being said that his brother was killed because his brother fired at them and they shot back.  Now he says that he knows his brother did not shoot, he thinks that the truth is not being spoken - that the applicants have not told the truth, that is why he's here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> He's also here Mr Chairman, because he said he wanted justice,  now that is fundamental, it's a fundamental misunderstanding.</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I don't think you should worry about that because this Committee is not swayed by that consideration.</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> I'm glad to hear that Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a>	Mr Cerqueira, did you give a statement to the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> But you were not called upon to testify in court, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> I wasn't called no, I don't know why.</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> Were you on the list of witnesses that they - I can perhaps understand why you were not called but were you on the list of witnesses at all, did they tell you you may be called?</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> They said I may be called.  On the 31st, the following day when I got to the restaurant there was a Mr Knight that was in the restaurant, a very arrogant person who I thought at the time I'm sorry to say, he asked somebody else to take the statement and that was it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> And your statement corresponds with what you're saying today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> Yes, I think so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> Mr Chairman, can I just ask Mr Prior if that statement - if it is available and if so, can it be made available to us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Mr Chairman, it's not available, I don't have it, I've searched for it, it's not in the docket, it's on any document that was handed to me when I joined on the 1st of October - we've made enquiries about not only Mr Cerqueira's statement but other statements that we just don't have.  What I can do is possibly investigate the matter further but I've searched diligently in this building for a statement and I haven't found one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> Mr Cerqueira?</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> The Benny - the waiter by the name of Benny you're referring to, that's Mr Benjamin Browdie is it - or Brodie?</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> That's him yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> I think he's here is he or he's been here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> I've seen him today,  yes I've seen him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> Now, would you say that on what you're telling us here today that he would have seen exactly or that he must have seen exactly what you're telling us you saw?</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> I think so.  Given the circumstances, he might not have seen all of it because we were all in fear when all this started happening but I think up until the point that we walked up to the door and the gentleman started firing at us and we ran in, I'm sure he remembers all that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> And one would have expected him to say that you were there - he was with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> Yes, I dragged him inside because he was actually - he was lucky to get away with it because the bullet hole was in his trousers, it didn't manage to hit his leg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> I also heard you saying and you must correct me if I'm wrong, you were there until 10 to 12?</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> I was there until about - no, no, I was there till way after, I was there till probably after the shooting and probably about 2 in the morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> Okay.  Now, in his evidence at court - where you at court when Mr Brodie gave evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> No, Sir.  Through all this what happened, I was not at all in court, I didn't go to court, I didn't want to go to court, I didn't want to go and listen to witnesses and I wanted to forget the whole thing.  Not at any stage did I go into court and sit and listen to proceedings or anything like that at any stage up until today, this is the first time that I'm facing people with regards to what's happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> Now in his evidence at court - the way it was summarised by the Judge, he never mentions your name at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> I'm referring Mr Chairman, to pages 46 and 47 of the record.</p>

<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> You weren't at court or you weren't at the restaurant at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> Why I wasn't in court.</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> But you're sure you were there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> I'm 100% sure I was there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> And you are the person that picked up your brother after he was - immediately after he had been shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> I didn't pick him up, I stayed with him while he was in the gutter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> Were you the first one to get to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> And not Mr Brodie?</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> So when he said that - when he says and I want to read to you in Afrikaans - page 47 Mr Chairman, line 6 onwards</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a>"He returned to the front door and saw him lying in the gutter, he went to sit with him and took his head in his arms, the body was still warm.  Initially he did not realise that he himself had been wounded in the back of the leg.  He was taken to hospital where this light wound was cleansed.  He did not see the deceased Cerqueira briefly before the shooting incident"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a>Now, in that bit that I read, your name doesn't feature at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> I don't know, I was there and then Benny came and sat on the pavement and quite correctly put his hands on his face and he asked me: "Is he gone, is he gone"? - those are the words he used.</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> You never used those words when Mr Prior asked you to relate to us what happened that night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> Now, about the firearm - your brother did have a firearm, we know that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> Yes, he did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> Was it your evidence that the police tested the firearm and the test established that he never used the firearm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> The police asked me if the gun was fired - Mr Brodie had brought the gun to me after I was outside with my brother he brought the gun to me.  There was a couple of policemen there ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> Could the witness please repeat the answer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just talk a little loudly please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> One of the policeman checked the gun and the gun hadn't been fired and he said to the other guy: "The gun hasn't been fired", all the bullets were in there according to the policeman - I didn't check the gun myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> Do you know where Mr Brodie got the gun from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> Is it possible that Mr Brodie could have picked up the gun on the pavement - on the side of the pavement where your brother was laying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> It might have been possible but I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> It might then also be ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> When I got to the body - I got to my brother's body first, my pouch that I gave to Mr Prior over there was laying next to him - that's what was laying there, nothing else - I didn't see no gun, nothing.  Mr Brodie brought me the gun, it was a couple of minutes in fact five to ten minutes after I was outside with my brother.</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> Is it possible then that your brother may have had a gun as he went out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> To my mind it's impossible, I didn't see the gun - I didn't see any gun, I saw the pouch there and that's it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> Unfortunately Mr Brodie - maybe he will come and tell us what happened to this gun because his evidence is simply that - on page 46 and 47 Mr Chairman</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a>"The vehicle moved slowly in his direction"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a>That's line 31 on page 46, that's now presumably in the direction where you were standing.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a>"When there was being fired on him he realised that this was being done from the motor vehicle, he swung around to run back in and dived behind the bar counter.  He called at Cerqueira to take the firearm held behind the bar counter in hand"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a>And then unfortunately he doesn't tell us anything further about the weapon, whether he in fact saw it there or not.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a>"Then he realised"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a>This from the summary:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a>"Then he realised that Cerqueira was not in the restaurant"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a>And then he went outside to the front door and saw that your brother was laying ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> That's correct.  Like I said earlier on I dragged Mr Brodie in because basically he froze obviously from shock or being scared and he went over the counter, I went over the counter shouting for my brother and after going over the counter he went into the kitchen shouting for my brother, I was shouting for my brother - I was in fact looking for the gun because I was afraid that these people would come into our restaurant and shoot us as well.  I couldn't find my brother, asked the staff, the staff was in a panic, we came outside, I went there and my brother was laying there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> So when you looked for the gun you couldn't find the gun?</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> I couldn't find the gun.</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> And you know that the gun was hid under the bar counter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> He normally used to hide the gun - I wasn't aware where he had it, he used to keep it for himself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> And you looked under the bar counter and you couldn't didn't find it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> I didn't look underneath the bar counter, I looked at normally on the table where he keeps other stuff and I looked at a box that sometime - what he does is or what he used to do, he moved the gun around because of staff and things like that and he would cover it with something, so I didn't know where the gun was that's why I was shouting for him to - I was basically shouting for him: "Jose, give me the gun or Joe, that's what we used to call him - "just give me the gun, give me the gun".</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> Is there any reason that you can think of why the police asked to have a look at the gun and to test the gun?</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> The police actually asked me if there was a gun, I said: "Yes, my brother's got a gun", I went in looking for it and: "This is the gun" and the one policeman took the gun, checked it - there was quite a few, I think four or five at the time, one in civilian clothes took the gun, checked it and the guy said the gun hasn't been fired.</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> And was that the gun that was brought to you or to the police by Brodie?</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> It was brought to my by Brodie and then I gave it to the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> Was it your evidence that you first heard something like a firecracker before you went outside?</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> Yes, there was first two pop sounds - pop, pop, like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> The first, and then Benny walked out and I walked behind him and I still remember - recall saying to him: "It sounds like crackers" and he said: "Yes", and we went out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> And just tell us again, what did you see?</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> Well I heard - after those first two sounds, I heard more repetition, it sounded like somebody scraping an exhaust of a motorcar or something and when I came out, the car that I had seen going up was coming down ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> So you - just stop there, so you had initially seen a car going up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> Yes.   I saw a car, the car slowed down at our door and go up and a couple of minutes after that, that's when we heard the popping sounds and we went out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> Is it the same car that you saw again later on coming back against the one-way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> Yes, it looked like the same car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> Looked like?</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> Yes, it was a dark car and looked the same as the - and it was heavy laden, the car at the nose was quite - like this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> And by then you had already heard this crackling sound?</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> Excuse me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> When you saw the car going up - which is the right way up Station Road towards Groote Schuur, the car was heavy laden and you had already heard the crackling sound?</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> Not going up no, there was no sounds at all when the car was going up.  The car was going up, nothing happened, they slowed down at our door, the car went up, after the car disappeared - you must regard a very small door, so we can't really see all the way up to Heidelberg Tavern.  The car went past our door and a couple of minutes after that, that's when I heard the first two popping sounds.</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> Now just tell why again, why would you have seen this car - I mean there are many cars going up the one-way I would have thought.</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> Because the car slowed down in front of our door and pulled off.</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> So it's purely by chance that you saw this car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> By chance when I was inside the restaurant - before I heard that popping sound.</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> So if it's the same car that you saw, then we must assume then that that car turned around at some point?  It first went up against the - with the one-way as it should and then must have come back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> Well, I don't know what the car did but it was definitely coming - when it was shooting at us, it was coming in the opposite direction, in other words against the one-way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> So it must have turned around then if it's the same car that you saw?</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> It must have turned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> Or aren't you sure that it's the same car that you saw?</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> To me it was the same car, it seems like the same car to me - it was a dark car, it was the same heavy laden car - it seems like the same car to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why do you say it was heavy laden, what do you mean by that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> Well you know, when you load a boot of a car and the car sort of sags and the nose is kind of up in the air, I noticed that the car was - the front of the car was like slightly up in the air like this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> So the first time you saw the car there was - apart from the fact that it was heavy laden and appeared to be loaded if that's what the word means, there was nothing particularly significant about you seeing the car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> No, no, not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> So you went on with your business and then you heard - you're saying you heard this crackling sound?</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> Then we heard the popping sounds, first it was like pop, pop like that and then it got like somebody was scratching an exhaust system of the car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> You heard rapid fire?</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> Or rapid fire.</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> Are you a gun enthusiast, do you own a gun?</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> No not really, I keep one for my protection because of the nature of business that I'm in or in fact the nature of business I've been all my life.</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> The sound that you heard, would it sound like automatic gunfire?</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> I'd say, I'd say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> And after you'd seen this car, how soon after that did you have to come - did you come out after you heard the popping sound?  Was it minutes after that, seconds?</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> At most a minute.</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> Okay.  What did you then observe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> When I came outside Benjamin Brodie was standing already outside and I followed him and another waiter Mike came and stood next to me and when I looked up like this the guys were shooting - both sides there were shots being fired, they were shooting still into sort of the direction of the Heidelberg, in other words the car was like ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> Now this is - now as you come out of  - is it Makados?</p>

<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">ADV ARENDSE:</span> As you come out of Machados the tavern is like a few metres to your right, you're talking about - is the shop three to four or five metres?</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> No, there's a ...[intervention]</p>

<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">MR CERQUEIRA:</span> That's correct, and there's another shop between us and then the Heidelberg Tavern.</p>
