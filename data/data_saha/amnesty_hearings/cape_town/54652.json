Mr Coetzee gave him something to drink, I don't know whether it was cool drink or a beer and he drank it, and approximately, I will have to guess, but approximately half an hour after that the man started swaying slowly.

In 1958 you successfully completed a detective course and you were placed in Marshall Plein in Johannesburg.'\nI wonder whether I could ask the interpreter to give me a signal or is that fine?

Then you did not do your promotional exam because of the unrest in 1960, but later on in 1960, you were appointed as branch officer in Umzimkhulu in Griqualand West and were promoted to sergeant.  In the first half of 1961, the district commander of Kokstad instructed you to go to Pondoland as a detective and to assist there with unrest related investigations'.\nI want to ask you now, during that stage Mr Erasmus, you told me, you for the first time in 1961 had to do with a certain phenomena, what was that?",
