That Mr Coetzee throws light on seeing a car in Jeffrey's Bay.  He talks about an actual discussion with Mr van Rensburg who is an applicant here.  He helps us in fixing a date because of the incident with the Audi. There is mention of both Ermelo and the car being found in Swaziland which has been hinted at by his counsel.  And there is the fact that he was present at Komatipoort where there were other policemen present, which is denied by the present applicants.\n\tThe truth also is that on the last occasion this matter was adjourned by the Committee on Amnesty precisely so that we could have a situation where Mr Coetzee is present and available to give evidence, through the fault of the TRC I was not present on that occasion, but as it happens that is why this matter could in fact have been largely finished last year, or if we were still to hear Mr Coetzee it would have been finished now.  It's certainly no fault of the family.\n\tWe are opposing the application of Mr Coetzee as these applicants, but the overriding thing we want to know is the right to the truth.  I may refer the Committee to an article by Juan Mendez, Accountability for Past Abusers, which appears in the Human Rights Quarterly in May 1997 and which talks about burgeoning international law rights and the overriding right to investigate, prosecute, punish the perpetrators but importantly to disclose to the victims, their families and society all that can be reliably established about the events and also corresponding right on the part of the victims which is a right to know the truth, and that's the basis of this application.",
