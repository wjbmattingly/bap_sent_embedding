I tried to follow the golden mean.\n\tPerhaps I could tell you a tale which would give you clarity regarding the subject.  At a certain stage I became so claustrophobic that I felt as if I would do anything to speak in order just to get a visit, that is why I said on a certain day that I would like to clear my conscience, that I was prepared to tell everything that I knew, but that I wouldn't speak to any of them but to the General.  They brought the General in by helicopter.  He arrived there and he said, \"Son can we talk to you, what's your position?\".  And I said yes General I would like to discuss a few things with you.  They took me out of the cells and treated me like a decent well-educated person.  They allowed me to have a cup of tea, and then they said, well are you read to speak?  I said yes I would like to talk about the food.  I would like to talk about my detention; my freedom; and a few other aspects.  And they said no we'll change everything for you but let's just talk about the involvement of others, and I said no General I have got nothing to say about that.  Naturally he expressed his disapproval and departed, but that hour of escape from those cells bought me another day.  \n\tSo you must understand when I speak to you of unforced coercion or coercion without any physical pressure which is exerted on the individual.",
