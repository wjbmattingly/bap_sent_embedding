The wind blows terribly in those areas there in Bontheuwel and the litter collected at the doorway of the Rent Office, so this was a disused milk carton, it was part of the litter that was collected, that the wind would have blown towards the door of the Rent Office and it's also so disguised because there was a very heavy Security Force presence there.

The regulations and the practice of this Committee is such that we cannot provide a forum for what ought to have been said in another Committee.  As you will appreciate, we are the only surviving Committee of the Commission, that's not of our own doing I would like to argue, but really we're under pressure to complete our work.  Aside from that, we strictly work to the rule of relevance and now if you wish to comment on my following comment, please do so when I'm finished.  The real test here is whether what is contained in these three or four pages are matters which are either going to detract or improve the application.  In my view it doesn't, one way or the other and therefore I must conclude that that is irrelevant.  The bigger test of all is that I must protect the integrity of this Committee from being used as a forum to say something that is irrelevant to this Committee and I again repeat, it is unfortunate that the clients weren't given an opportunity to say it where it should have been said and maybe it can be taken up by you to the members of the Commission, but certainly I am not, I am loath to grant permission to put this on record because in fact it's not going to improve your client's case at all.",

In your capacity as Regional Commander of the MK, did you not consider the fact that training young people with very very lethal weapons could be dangerous?

We didn't go to seek out Standard 8 children.  Vanessa was somebody who had presented herself first and foremost as a very disciplined person who could keep a secret, if I could put it so crudely, Your Honour.  That was the first criteria.  How suited was this person to underground work?  Now we didn't, once we recruited them, we didn't just place weapons and explosives in their hands.  Vanessa testified that her role in this blast was supplementary really.  Her job was to go along, to gain experience, to go through the threshold of carrying out an operation.  That's how our operators worked, Your Honour, that they went through different stages, they went through different thresholds.  When Sidney went with Colleen Williams on previous operations, Colleen had detonated the mine.  Colleen would previously have played the role that Vanessa did and so it was a very gradual, it was a very staged approach, so it wasn't a question of us giving Vanessa limpet grenade and AKs and stuff like that.  They went through a stage  Your Honour and as I have testified before, our emphasis was on avoiding civilian targets, casualties at all times, so the reply to your question, Your Honour is, yes, it does seem quite shocking and startling and irresponsible to have recruited the Standard 8 school girl to be part of an MK unit, but Your Honour, the planting of a bomb, or the firing of an AK is 5% of the work, there is an enormous amount of work that went into this operation at the Bontheuwel Rent Office and we needed all sorts of people to do that.  There are some places where only schoolgirls could enter.  There are some places where schoolboys would ask them no questions and let me just assure this Hearing that there were no other Standard 8 school children in this part of our Detachment, but really Your Honour, there was a multitude of tasks to be performed in an operation, we shouldn't just think of MK or military work as bomb blasts or armed attacks.  That really was 5 or even less percent of the work and that's where people like Vanessa came in.  Vanessa was somebody whom we could trust and we did trust her with our lives.  Vanessa was somebody who grew up in Bontheuwel, who was passionate about justice, but who wasn't somebody who shouted from the rooftops Your Honour and she was very, very far advanced for her age.",
