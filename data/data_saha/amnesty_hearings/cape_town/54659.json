I am unmarried. I passed standard 7 at school and I joined the PAC in 1987 through AZANYO.  I joined APLA in 1990 while in Tanzania.  I received military training in Tanzania and Uganda, I returned to South African in 1992.\nI was involved in four APLA operations before the Heidelberg Tavern incident.  The first one was in Boipatong in Gauteng, the second one was in Heilbron in the Free State and then lastly the Nyanga East army base and Lingelethu West police station attacks.  At all times the targets to be hit were only made known to me as a unit member on the day of the attack.  \nThe affidavit of Gqomfa has been read to me and I confirm it's contents insofar as it relates to me.  In regard to the Heidelberg Tavern attack, I was supposed to throw a hand grenade but I did not do so.  At the time I did not think it \nwise to do so because I would almost certainly have killed my comrades as they were retreating from the attack on the tavern.\nI was however  part of the unit which attacked the tavern and which caused the death of four people, I therefore take responsibility for what happened.  I deeply regret causing the loss of life and causing grief to the families of the victims involved, I am sorry and I ask for their forgiveness.  I believe however in the cause that I was fighting through APLA because at time the country was still being governed by a White minority.\nThis White minority had taken the land of the African people by force and in my view and in the view of APLA as I understood it, we were to take the land back by force.  I carried out the instructions of APLA to attack the Heidelberg Tavern and other targets, I did not question these instructions. I respectfully submit that my application complies with the requirements of the Act and that I have made full and proper disclosure to this Committee of my involvement in the Heidelberg Tavern incident.  I respectfully request that my application for \namnesty be granted.\nCan you confirm that what's been read to you is - accords with your instructions?",
