<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a>1	MR FALTEIN</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> I proceed now before you members of the Committee and I will be representing the next applicant as  well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLIAM FALTEIN:</span> s s</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> William, yourself and your co-accused were convicted and sentenced for having committed the offence of murder and two attempted murders on the 10th September  1993 by Potchefstroom Circuit Court.  Do you confirm that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> Yes, I agree, we did do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> I believe at the time of the commission of this offence you were a member of the African National Congress Youth League, (indistinct) Branch, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN::</span> Yes, it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> I believe that being a member of the Youth Congress you were serving in your capacity as member of that structure's defence unit, is  that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> Yes, it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> And I believe that when these offences were committed you were acting in that capacity as  such, of being a member of the defence unit, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> Yes, it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> It is recorded that the  person that you killed on the 24th December 1990, was David Maseko.   Who is this David Maseko, the one that you killed, David Maseko?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> The person that we killed was David Mayeko, not David Maseko.  David Mayeko was a State witness.  David Mayeko that we killed was a member of the gangster group called vigilantes that was harassing the activities in the location and victimising all activities and killing people around the location and they burnt our house as well and they burnt all our property in the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a>1	MR DLAVANE:    /...</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a>2	MR FALTEIN</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> David Mayeko, did you know him personally?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> Yes, I knew him because we grew up together in  the location.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> Do you know him to be the leader of this vigilante gang as you now allege?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> Yes, he was the  leader of the vigilante gangsters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> And when you killed him, was it for any  other  reason that you felt that he deserved to be killed?  What persuaded you to kill David Mayeko?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> Because David Mayeko was a member of the gangster vigilante.  We fled  away for a long  time from our homes  and spending  too much time away from our families and running away from the police.  On the 24th December  when we got there, we got the message that David Mayeko was looking for us.   As we went out of the street with Themba Nqobe we met David Mayeko in the vigilante group and then he took out a gun and he chased us around.  We jumped two streets.  When we tried to go back and then accused  No 2 started shooting him.  It was not his intention to shoot him.  He was just   trying to scare him away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> I would like you to listen to what  I  will be asking you and I'll ask you to concentrate on the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Could you please ask him to speak a little bit slower.  I think they have got trouble in keeping up with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> Please speak slow so that everybody here can hear what you are saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> Yes, I will do so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> This David Mayeko, the one that you have just 1	described/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a>2	MR FALTEIN</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a>described having been the leader  of this vigilante group,</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a>this vigilante group that you have just mentioned, is it a group that was harassing, maiming, killing in the Khutsong Township at that time, is that what you are trying to tell this Committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> Yes, it was a group that was killing and raping people without any reasons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> And you are telling this Committee that because they were committing  such  atrocious acts you from the defence unit of the African National Congress, the youth section, you were acting in defence of the Khutsong community and yourself.  Is that what ....(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> That's not what he said.  You are putting words into his mouth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> Thank you, Judge.  Is that the impression that you are trying to convey to this Committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN::</span> Yes, that's what I am trying to say.  They were killing people in the location.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> So I believe that between yourselves, by "yourselves" I mean the defence units and this vigilante group, what was happening at the time it was like a straight battle between the two groups, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> It was a political thing.  They used to kill all activists in the location if you are affiliated to the ANC, they will kill you with the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> I believe that you yourself, as you are sitting there, you at one stage during that conflict did become a victim as you were shot at, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> Yes, it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> And I believe that during that conflict as</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a>well you had your parents' house burnt to ashes, is that </p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a>1	correct/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a>3	MR FALTEIN</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a>correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> Yes,  my parents' house was burnt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> And I believe the alleged perpetrators of these acts included the deceased and this vigilante group, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Did you in fact see them doing the burning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> Yes,  I saw them, but at that night I was away sleeping at my brother's place.  I was not at home.   They were seen by my sister who was at school.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> So you did not see, you merely heard something.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> When I got home in that morning I was told that I  must come and see how our house was burnt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> You may not have seen him personally  burning your parents' home, but you are convinced that the act was committed by the vigilante group, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> Yes, it is so, because  even my sister saw what they did.  He saw Thomas Vundla(?)  who was one of the vigilante groups.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> And this David Mayeko, the deceased, you know him to be the leader of this vigilante group, is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> Yes, David Mayeko was a leader of  the vigilante group.  He was  always there whenever they were to hit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> You mentioned in your statement that this group under the leadership of the deceased was always acting in  collusion with the police, is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> Yes, it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> And the police who were acting in collusion with this gang, you mention them in your statement as well,</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a>1	is/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a>4	MR FALTEIN</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a>is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> Yes, I did mention all the police in the statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> And these policemen in your statement you are saying  they were always with the deceased.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> Yes, they always moved around with - they used to go to 685 where all the vigilante group used to stay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> I want you now to describe to this Committee how and where was this David Mayeko killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> David Mayeko was killed nearby 685 where he was staying, on the corner of the third street in the squatter camp.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> The day he was killed, how was he killed, where were you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> When David Mayeko died I was there.  We were standing on the corner of the street.  It just happened a distance away from where we were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> And then what happened?  Where was he at  the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> He had fallen down next to some water stream,  but we didn't notice because we walked away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> Was he shot or what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> Yes, he was shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> Did you shoot him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> No, he wasn't shot by me.   He was shot by John Themba Ncube.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> And he was with this person who shot him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> Yes, I was with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> This defence unit that you were a member thereof, can you describe to this Committee how did it come that they were formed?  What I want to know is whether was</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a>1	it/....</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a>5	MR FALTEIN</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a>it under a particular instruction of someone in the leadership or ....</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> It was just formed but there was no leader</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a>because in Nkutsong there was violence and there was no one who was leading and there were too many people in the location and mainly it was the police and the vigilante group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> This murder was committed under the auspices of your organisation, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> No, it was under the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> Because of the atrocities that were being committed by this vigilante group you acted for the sake of  peace, stability and democracy in Nkutsong Township, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> Yes, it is so.  We tried to restore peace in Nkutsong.   The police  didn't take any steps even if the gangsters killed people.  They did nothing about it and they got even the guns from the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> I believe that this group was so well-armed, is  it so?  The group that I am referring to, the vigilante?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> Yes, it is so.  They were armed all the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> Who was arming them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> This policeman, Captain Van Graan and Oosthuizen -they got all these firearms from the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Just give us the name of the policemen again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> Thomas Mandla Mkonza(?), Vincent Godele(?), Oosthuizen, Van Graan, Devan Oosthuizen, Captain Van Graan.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> ... giving weapons to these people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> The thing is they are always around with the police wherever they were.  They met at 685 in Nkutsong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Is that your reply?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a>1	MR FALTEIN:/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a>6	MR FALTEIN</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> Yes, whenever I saw them they were always carrying firearms.  They were always accompanied by a policeman and even they were just visiting the police stations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> When he was shot, which policeman accompanied him on that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> I have forgotten his surname.  He was called Scarface because he had a scratch on his nose.  I don't remember his surname.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Did he give evidence at your trial?</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> Yes, he did because when we got in court they told us that they don't trust us.  They cannot listen to our case, they cannot take statements from us, therefore we left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> You were convicted of murder, weren't you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> Yes, it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Did he give evidence at that trial?</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> Yes, I did give evidence in court.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Did the policeman you call Scarface who you say was accompanying the deceased when he was shot give evidence at your trial?</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> No, Scarface was not there when we appeared in court.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Mr Faltein, I am afraid we don't have a picture as to what happened on the day this person was killed and I am going to take you back a little bit before your counsel presenting evidence puts questions to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a>The deceased was killed on the 24th December, you said so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> Yes, he was killed on the 24th December 1990.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> When did you see him for the first time that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a>1	MR FALTEIN:/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a>7	MR FALTEIN</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> I first saw David Mayeko the first time when he started chasing us trying to shoot us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Where were you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> I was with co-accused David Themba Ncube.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> And did you see the deceased on the street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> I saw him coming out of the 685 yard.  That was the first time when I saw him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> When you saw him come out of 685 yard, he was not yet chasing was he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> As he went out that's when he was starting to chase us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> When you saw him for the first time he was not yet chasing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> Yes, they were chasing us all the time from the location and on the 24th December we were visiting our parents when we saw them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> I am trying to get you to start right at the beginning as to what happened on the 24th and you must listen to my questions carefully.  You saw the deceased for the first time on the 24th December 1990 in the yard of 685.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> Yes, he used to go at 685, but on the 24th I saw him going out of the yard chasing us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> And then what happened when you saw him come out of 685?</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> When he went out of the yard he called us.  We just ran away and then he was shooting in the air as we were running across the streets.  And then when we thought that he had turned away, we thought he was away but the co-accused shot him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> You are giving your evidence in a very telegraphic manner that I don't understand what you are</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a>1	saying/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a>8	MR FALTEIN</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a>saying, I am afraid.  You can't just shoot in the air and then you run and then Mr Ncube just shoots him.  Surely there must be some things that happened.  Didn't Mr Ncube stop, turn around, look at the deceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> As he was chasing us, when we got to a third street, standing in the corner, we thought he was no longer chasing us, we wanted to go back home.  As we were standing and when we turned around that was the time when the deceased faced us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> You turn around and then, that was when the deceased faced you, and then?   Mr Faltein, why do we struggle like this to get information out of you?  Were you not told that when you make application for amnesty you must come and give all the details and all the information to us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> I do understand because I read the whole booklet on application.  When we got to a third street we stopped.   We thought that we were going to go back.  He was  carrying a gun and he wanted to shoot us.  When we tried to go back he was having his gun in  his hand all the time.   He had a gun in his hand when Themba Ncube shot him.</p>

<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> It is because I was always in the co-accused's company, that's why I was accused of having murdered the deceased.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> What do you say you did?  (Inaudible) what they allege you did do.</p>

<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> The police who was handling the case told me</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a>that me and Themba killed the deceased. </p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> When you were in court, what did they say you did?  Did they say you stabbed him, did they say you also shot him?  What did they say you did to the deceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> In court they said we shot the deceased.  We never shot, but I was there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> In court they said you also shot the deceased, you, Mr Faltein?</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> No, in court they said both of us had guns.  They didn't say exactly who shot the deceased.  They just told us that we are being charged for murdering the deceased.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Did you also in fact have a gun?</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> Yes, I had a gun, but I never used it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Why have you not mentioned this before?   Why didn't your counsel lead this evidence that you were armed with a gun?</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> Yes,  I had a gun but I never used it, but I never used the gun.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> You see, Mr Faltein, that is why I have been having the feeling that you are not telling us - you are not disclosing to us what you should be telling us.  That is why you are only now mentioning this gun.  Because  it has been quite clear that you are telling us - giving us all the details as to what happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> I had the gun all the time, but I never used it.</p>

<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> It was the deceased and two State witnesses and  Scarface.  The rest I didn't see.</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> So all that happened that day, if I were to sum you up was that on the 24th December you saw the deceased for the first time when he came out of 685.</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> On the 24th December it was the first time that I saw the deceased.  I hadn't seen him for a long time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> And you say when he saw you he started chasing you and you two ran away.</p>

<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> And then at some point you stopped, turned  round and then Mr Ncube shot him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> At that point in time when we turned with the intention to go back home he was still following us and co-accused shot him.</p>

<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> The two attempted murder charges I know nothing about them.  I was just told that we attempted to murder David (name indistinct) as well.</p>

<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> It was David Maseko and the Sgoqo.  I don't remember his first name.</p>

<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Did they tell the magistrate that you tried to kill them in the same incident at the same time as the deceased was murdered, was killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> Yes, they did tell the court that we did try to kill them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> What did they say?  How did they say you tried to kill them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> They didn't explain to the court as to how did we intend to kill them.  They didn't tell the court clearly as to how did we try to kill them.  I saw David Maseko for  the first time in court.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> ....  I wasn't there, but I have severe doubts as to whether they can just get into the witness box and say nothing as to how you tried to kill them.    Surely they must have said something, even if you didn't agree with them.  Just tell us what they said how you tried to kill  them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> I don't remember what happened to them clearly.  I saw them for the first time in court when they said that we tried to kill them and David Maseko was in gaol and it was for the first time when I saw him in court.</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> In court what did he say you went about trying to kill him?  Did he say you tried to chop him with a panga, did he say you shot at him?  What did he say?</p>

<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> I really don't think that you -  what</p>

<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> I passed Std 8.</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> When was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> I passed my Std 8 in 1992.</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> For a person who has passed Std 8 I would expect that if somebody came into court and said you wanted to kill him in this way and that way, I would expect you to can remember what that person said about you.   That was very serious.   You have gone to gaol as a result of that isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> I don't know as to why does he say that I tried to kill him.  I just knew him that he was staying at 685.  I've never met him before.</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> You had somebody defending you didn't you at the trial?</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> Yes, I had a State advocate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> And are you asking us to believe that a witness just got into the witness box and said he tried to kill me and your advocate didn't ask any questions as to how you tried to kill him?  Are you asking us to believe that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> Yes, he did say in court that we tried to  kill him but he didn't explain to the court as to how and why did we try to kill him.</p>

<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> The first shot, it was in the air, and the rest he was shooting us as we were running along.  I only heard the one that he shot in the air.</p>

<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> What sort of firearm was it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> It is a 765.</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Who did it belong to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> I had the weapon, I was using it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Who did it belong to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> It was mine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> How did you get possession of an unlicensed firearm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> We got the firearms from the vigilante gangster group members.  As we fought with them we took the firearms from them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Mr Faltein, was Mr Mayeko aiming at yourself or was he aiming at Mr Ncube when he was shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> He was pointing in our direction, not to anyone specific.</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> You said you got the gun from the vigilantes when you fought with them.  You got the gun from the vigilantes, the 765, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> Yes, I got it whilst we were fighting  amongst the groups and I would pick it up if anyone dropped it whilst during the fight.</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Only  one further questions.  How many shots, did Ncube fire at the  deceased or at the other persons with the deceased?  How many shots were fired on that day?  You've told us the deceased fired one shot in the air.  How many other shots were fired?</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> The other shots that were fired were by the</p>

<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Which policeman, Scarface?</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> Yes, Scarface did it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Let's just get this clear.  Were you not given a firearm - or let me put it to you this way.  Your evidence is not that you were given a firearm by the ANC Youth League or the SDU to protect the community.  That  firearm you got from the gangsters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> Yes, I picked the firearm during the faction fights in the street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Was the person who used to own the firearm injured in the fight?</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> No, I never saw the owner of the firearm.  I just saw the firearm because it was a lot of people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> ... about these faction fights.    What are the faction fights about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> These gangsters, they were fighting with activists.  They came to a night vigil of a comrade and then they shot people there in the night vigil.</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> How many faction fights have there been?</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> It started in 1990 and then it subsided in  1991 in the location.</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> There have been many faction fights.</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> As I see, from 1990 up to 1991, there was no peace in the location but only in 1991 onwards.</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Mr Faltein, could you just assist  us in providing us with more information with regard to your self-defence unit.  Was it connected to the ANC structure or was it connected to the community, like the Civic Association?</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> It was connected to Civic Association.  Everything that we did was reported to the Civic</p>

<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> Yes, after the deceased shot, Scarface kept on shooting.  I cannot tell exactly how many shots were they.</p>

<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Did your group ever take a decision that the deceased should be killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> No, we never take the decision that the deceased must be killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> One  final point I'd like you to clear up for me, please.  You told us that you were on the way to visit your parents on the 24th December, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> Yes, it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Where were you .....</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> When all this started the ANC Youth League,  they decided to take us to Orlando in a mission, for Methodist Mission.  That's where we stayed in Orlando.</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Where do your parents live?</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> They are staying in Khutsong, 66 Xhosa Section.</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> And I take it there  are many  ways of getting from the Methodist Mission to your  parents without going past 685, which you knew to be the headquarters  of the vigilantes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> No, as I said, the Methodist Church that I am talking about is in Orlando, in Soweto.</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> And did you have your firearms in the Methodist Mission in Orlando?</p>

<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> No, we never had firearms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Well, where did you get them on this day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> No, these firearms we had them in the location and then there were donations from the location community to get these firearms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> You told us you found your firearm lying in the street after a fight.  Now you say it was donations from the location community?</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> As I said that as I was staying in Orlando they were - the particular one that I had I picked it up in the street.  The rest was donated by the location community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Where were they kept?</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> They were being kept in the location.  This lady, she is no longer in the location now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Do I understand that on this day on the  way to visit your parents you stopped, armed yourselves, and then proceeded to pass the place where you knew the vigilantes lived?</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> No, we were not carrying these  weapons because  we were going to go via there, but we were just on  our way home and we just met the deceased on his way out from 685.</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> But you had armed yourself.  You have told me that you did not have these weapons at the Methodist Mission  where you were living at the time, so you must have  armed yourself that day on the way to visit your parents, is that  so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> No, these firearms we were just having them to protect us in the location in case we come across the vigilante gangster groups.  It was just coincidence that we met the deceased in the street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> But you went to where he lived.  Don't talk</p>

<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> No, we were not going to 685.  We were passing there.   It is on our way home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> You were passing there, armed with weapons you had collected that day.  Is that not true?</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> Yes, we had guns, but we were just on our way home.  It was just in the neighbourhood.</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Could you not have used a different route other than having to go past 685 to get to your parents' home?</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> No, there was no other route, because our houses are in the same street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> When was your parents' home set on fire?</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> It was burnt on the 3rd December 1990 by the vigilantes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Mr Faltein, this is not a case where you were  sent on a mission by a political organisation or SDU, given a weapon and given instructions to go and eliminate somebody who was interfering with political activity.   Your mission was not on such instructions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> We were not given instructions.   We were just always in possession of these guns in order to defend ourselves and the community against these gangsters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> ... that you went past 685 by coincidence  or simply because there was no other way.  It is not because  you had been given instructions to go and eliminate this ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> We were just passing.   We had no intentions to shoot them, only to find out that the deceased appeared out of the yard to shoot us.  We had no intentions to kill</p>

<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> No, we always  go past 685 because even on our</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a>way to school we always use that route.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Mr Faltein, I want to understand you.  I am a little bit confused.   Can I assume that your evidence is to  this effect,  that you did not intend to shoot Mayeko, and that if Mayeko had not come out of 685 and shot at you you would not have shot at him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> Yes,  our intention was not to shoot him.   We were just on our way and when he appeared and to shoot us,  unfortunately my co-accused tried to scare him away, not to  kill him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> ... shot in self-defence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> Yes, we were shooting back in self-defence.  We were trying to run away.  Unfortunately he was shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> ... attempted to kill you, even if he was not Mr Mayeko, the leader of the vigilante group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> We were not going to shoot anybody.    The only problem  that we have was the vigilante group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> I think the question was that had it been anybody else instead of the deceased, had there been anybody else who shot at you, you would have shot back at him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> Most of the vigilante people we knew them;  we wouldn't just shoot back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Mr Mpshe, you have had a good rest.  It is your turn.</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Mr Faltein, since when did you become a member of the SDU, which year?</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> I was a member of the ANC Youth League and then 1	I/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a>20	MR FALTEIN</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a>I joined the self-defence unit during the fights in the location because of the vigilante group. </p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> If you could provide us with the year.</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> I joined the organisation in 1986 and then we</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a>changed to become the self-defence unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> ... of leadership in the SDUs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> No, I was not a leader.</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> There was no leader.  We were just given  instructions.  There was just self-defence units in every section.  This was done alternatively.   We did this in shifts, so there was no specific leader.</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> ... you were just acting as an amorphous body without any form of leadership whatsoever.</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> We used to report to the branch as to what happened the day before.  We used to report everything the day after.  There was nothing else that we (inaudible).  We were reporting to the Youth League and to the Civic  Association women.   It was Dr  (inaudible) but he passed away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> (Question inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> It was Mama Noqebe(?).  I don't remember where she is now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> What was the name of this vigilante group, if it had any?</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> They used to call themselves vigilantes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> (Question inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> They were using the name for vigilantes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Now you testified that this vigilante, they killed, maimed and even burned houses of residents, you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> Yes, they were killing and burning down houses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a>1	MR MPSHE:   /...</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a>21	MR FALTEIN</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Are you in a position that you can tell us the exact reason why they did this?  What was their target?</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> The main thing that they were against, they were helping the police in fighting people who were fighting against oppressions.  They were going along with the police and identifying comrades and burning down their houses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Can you tell this Committee as to whether there was any form of connection between the vigilante group and  the police?  Was there such a connection?</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> Wherever they were they were accompanied by the police.  Whatever they did the police were present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> What things did you know personally that they did together with the police?  Just mention one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> The one thing  that I saw them in the location is  when they shot at Michael Dlameni's home.  The deceased was there and some other police, Mkonza(?) and Oosthuizen, they were there shooting people and they asked  as  to what was happening whilst they did everything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> ... were in the police together with the vigilante shot at people at night vigils, was that ever reported to the authorities of the Police Force?</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> Yes,  the next day the police came to investigate as to what happened and how many people were injured and many people were injured and the police arrived the next day to investigate the matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Besides this shooting at the night vigil, do you know of any incidents wherein vigilantes and the police  were involved?</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> The other thing that was done by the vigilante,  there was going to be a launch at a school and they arrived and they started shooting and they said to the people</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a>2	disperse/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a>22	MR FALTEIN</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a>disperse, you cannot launch COSAS at this school.  We are not going to allow this.   It was one member from the vigilante group.  We didn't know many of them because they weren't from this township, all of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> ... the people who were shooting at this school were not vigilante people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> Yes,  they were the vigilantes, because they arrived at school.  That was on the day of launching COSAS.</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a>They were together with other people we do know who are residing in this township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> At the time of the shooting were the police anywhere near that school?</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> The police station was far from the school, but the police arrived thereafter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> During the shooting spree, could the police be seen in the neighbourhood?</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> No, at the time they arrived we had already dispersed.  There was nobody in the school yard.  We don't know what did they do on their arrival.</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> You have given the Committee only one instance wherein the vigilante and the police worked in cahoots.   Now is there any other instance which you can recall wherein the police worked in cahoots with the vigilantes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> Yes, everywhere you would see them they would be in the company of the police.  They had police in their company all the time.   As I have already explained, they came to shoot at a night vigil and they came to shoot at the school on the launching of COSAS and when they were moving  around in the townships you'd see them in  the company of the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Were vigilantes ever arrested during that</p>

<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> Yes, they were arrested.  They'd be taken to the police station at the township and in the evening they would be released to be free men.</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> ... presently in gaol now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> Not even one of them is in gaol now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Was there any enmity, any bad blood between yourself and the vigilantes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> Yes, because they  kept on attacking us all the time accompanied by the police.  They were  looking for activists, people who are involved in the struggle.  When I was sentenced in (indistinct) I was shown a photo that I am one of those who was supposed to be killed in the location.</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> ... joined the SDU and the Youth League, surely there were other people who were already involved in SDUs and Youth League, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> Yes, there were some other people that I don't remember that were members.  But most of the people are no longer in the location now and most of them I don't remember them.</p>

<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> Yes, they were there at that time.</p>

<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> The SDU was formed when the vigilante started killing people in the location.</p>

<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> Yes, there is quite a lot of people who were killed by the vigilante.   There were too many comrades that were killed by the vigilante group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Did you ever see the vigilantes in a meeting  with the police or travelling in police vehicles?</p>

<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> Some of them I saw.  When I was shot I found  them in the police station sitting around there and they beat me up there with the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Mr Faltein, as one of the Committee  members correctly said, we don't know really what  happened on that day.  I am going to request you to tell us when did you people decide to approach David Mayeko, what had happened  and what actually happened step by step until he lost his life.  Just tell us everything that happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> When David Mayeko died, he was somebody that we knew very well.   His grandmother was in our neighbourhood, we knew him very well, and even when he joined this thing he used to accompany the police to come and look for me in order to kill me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Just a minute, can I just try to clarify something.  Which question are you answering?</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> I am answering the question that how well did  I know David Mayeko.</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> You see, that was not the question and perhaps, I don't know whether there is something wrong, there is some misunderstanding between you and the interpreter.  Because that was definitely not the question.  The question was to tell us exactly step by step what happened on that day and I became troubled when I noticed that your answer has nothing to do with the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> David was a member of the vigilante.  They used to give us problems in the location, burning down houses and 2	they/...</p>

<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a>aren't you?  And the witness is also Xhosa-speaking.  I don't know Xhosa, I can't be so sure myself.   Are you satisfied with the interpretation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> I believe I am satisfied with the interpretation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> I just wanted to clear this  for the purpose  of record because sometimes we get some puzzling answers to certain questions.  So if you are satisfied that there is nothing wrong with the questions,  the interpretation is all right then at least we know that the witness would have understood the question.  Thank you.</p>

<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> I don't know what the reason is for him to chase us.  He was just harassing us  with the police.   It was just part of the harassment for him to chase us.  We had to be killed.</p>

It was just reported in the police and there was no steps taken by them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> I get the impression, as you responded to certain questions, that you just went past there, you had no  intention of killing David, you were not there to provoke David, you were not sent by anybody, it was no instruction whatsoever, and the gun that you were carrying was an illegal gun.   Why did you carry that gun?</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> The gun that I had was for the purpose of defending myself in case these people want to kill us up here.</p>

Do you  remember that?  You jumped two roads.  And you then didn't realise he was chasing you any more so you turned to go home, is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> Yes, after passing the two streets we tried to turn back.  That's when we met him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> And you saw him standing there and your friend shot him.</p>

I am asking you a question in relation to what you said earlier on that you were a member of the SDU which was to defend the community.

<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> We were defending the community by whilst the vigilante were attacking people we kept an eye in patrolling in the location.

<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> What I can say in front of this Committee is that when the deceased was a very troublesome person in the location.  He was killing people and burning down houses until he burnt my property and my parents were burnt.  And afterwards the police never did anything until the time when he died on the 24th.  And  the police were quite aware of everything, but no steps were taken by them and nobody was arrested.</p>

<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> That is correct.  The guns that we had were to  protect the community against the vigilante.</p>

<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a><span class="speaker">MR FALTEIN:</span> Yes, peace prevailed after his death, and as I have already indicated, that we went to the meeting to  discuss that there should be peace amongst people of Khutsong.</p>

I have just caused copies to be made of the investigation report to me and these copies will be tabled in that it is stated that even the case docket has disappeared, but I am going to table that when the Committee resumes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> In this case the docket has disappeared?  What about the Judge's judgment?  Has any enquiry been made if a copy of that is available?</p>

<p class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> Mr Ncube, in the period of 1990 you were a member  of the ANC Youth League, Khutsong, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> Yes, it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> And you served in your  capacity as a member of the self-defence unit of that organisation as well, is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> Yes, it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> Mr Ncube, I appeal to you now to listen  very carefully.   Answer the questions as  they may be asked.  You were yourself and your co-accused Faltein, were convicted and sentenced for having committed an act of murder, one, two attempted  murder charges, robbery, and malicious damage to property, that is yourself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Were they tried together?  As I understood it, the previous applicant was charged only with murder and two attempted murders.</p>
<p class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> Chairperson, the applicant was charged with applicant  No 1 only in the case of murder and two  attempted murder cases.  The case of malicious damage to property and robbery was tried in the Regional Court.</p>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> You asked him were yourself and your co-accused convicted and charged.  They weren't.  Himself and his co-accused were only convicted and charged with murder</p>
<p class="line" id="line585"><a name="pos585"></a>2	and/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line586"><a name="pos586"></a>35	MR NCUBE</p>
<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a>and two attempted murders,  isn't that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line588"><a name="pos588"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> That is so, and I accept the explanation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line589"><a name="pos589"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> And  these offences as they are and as they appear in your application for amnesty, these are the acts that you are now here today asking this Committee to grant you amnesty thereon,  is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> It is  so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Is there a proper application before  us for amnesty in respect of the robbery and the malicious damage to property?</p>
<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> Chairperson, I refer to the charges as  they appear on the applicant's application for amnesty and I believe that having been tried and sentenced on these charges the applicant believes that they too do fall under the category that he is applying for amnesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line593"><a name="pos593"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> But he is responsible forgiving full details in the application for amnesty and what his application says, "Robbery, can't remember the date committed, but was sentenced on the 29th  May 1991".  He doesn't  tell us where or when it was committed.  He further says on page 3 of  his application "Robbery came to be as a matter of hunger whilst on the run as well as malicious.  PS  A statement in detail will  be enclosed together with this form".  No such statement was enclosed as far as I know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line594"><a name="pos594"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> Chairperson, I went through the statement of the applicant and I believe from the interpretation thereof that the two  offences of malicious damage to property and robbery were in fact committed at the very same time and they are interlinked with this case of murder.  Thus, I believe the  applicant will be able to expantiate more  when  he gives his  explanation before this Committee.  I will</p>
<p class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a>3	appeal/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line596"><a name="pos596"></a>36	MR NCUBE</p>
<p class="line" id="line597"><a name="pos597"></a>appeal that he be given the chance to expantiate further on this as he shall be giving his evidence. </p>
<p class="line" id="line598"><a name="pos598"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> Mr Ncube, let's start with this case of this murder.  This murder was committed on the 24th December 1990, is it correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line599"><a name="pos599"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> Yes, it is  correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line600"><a name="pos600"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> And listen to the question very carefully now.  Who did you kill on this date of  the 24th December 1990?</p>
<p class="line" id="line601"><a name="pos601"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> I killed David Mayeko.</p>
<p class="line" id="line602"><a name="pos602"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> The two attempted murder cases, who are these people that you attempted to kill and when was  it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line603"><a name="pos603"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> It was on the same day I killed David Mayeko.  The other one was Maseko and Daniel Sgoqo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line604"><a name="pos604"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> So these two, Maseko and Daniel Sgoqo, were with David Mayeko on the same day and time when you killed Mayeko.</p>
<p class="line" id="line605"><a name="pos605"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> Yes, it is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line606"><a name="pos606"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> To clarify the Committee further, I proceed to this one of malicious damage to property, if I am allowed.  When was this offence committed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line607"><a name="pos607"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> In 1990.</p>
<p class="line" id="line608"><a name="pos608"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> Which property did you damage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line609"><a name="pos609"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> It was a car that was delivering  - a bakery delivery van and police houses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line610"><a name="pos610"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> Now robbery, who did you rob and when?</p>
<p class="line" id="line611"><a name="pos611"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> I robbed these bakery vans, Blue Ribbon and Delmas because we needed money to help each other as comrades.</p>
<p class="line" id="line612"><a name="pos612"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> Now let's go back again to this one of murder. David Mayeko you killed, who was this David Mayeko?  Can you briefly explain that to this Committee.  Who was this David</p>
<p class="line" id="line613"><a name="pos613"></a>3	Mayeko/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line614"><a name="pos614"></a>37	MR NCUBE</p>
<p class="line" id="line615"><a name="pos615"></a>Mayeko who deserved to die?</p>
<p class="line" id="line616"><a name="pos616"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> David Mayeko is a person that I know, we grew up together.   We used to play football together in the same  street.  We were schooling at Hlangabesa and he was in Pororong(?).  We joined the ANC organisation.  As we joined the ANC David Mayeko was very greedy for money therefore they were bought by the police, the white policemen, so that they can be able to kill activities(sic) in Khutsong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line617"><a name="pos617"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> So this David Mayeko, was he David Mayeko who belonged to the vigilante group of Khutsong at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line618"><a name="pos618"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> Yes, it is  so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line619"><a name="pos619"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> And what did  this David Mayeko do in particular that ultimately led to his death on the 24th December 1990?</p>
<p class="line" id="line620"><a name="pos620"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> When the comrades were in a rally on our way back he - they will be waiting  for us with the  police on our way back from these rallies and they will be shooting us, disturbing the funerals of the comrades and so on and he killed people who didn't ....(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line621"><a name="pos621"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> I am asking what was this David Mayeko doing actually that led ultimately to his death on the 24th December, that is prior to the 24th December?</p>
<p class="line" id="line622"><a name="pos622"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> David Mayeko was somebody who was harassing the comrades as a whole in Khutsong.  In our rallies they were around shooting people.  On our way back home they will be shooting people and when we were supposed to bury the same people they will be coming in the night to disturb in the  night vigil, shooting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line623"><a name="pos623"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> Do you know of any person that you know to have been killed by this David Mayeko and his group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line624"><a name="pos624"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> Yes, there is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line625"><a name="pos625"></a>3	ADV DLAVANE:/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line626"><a name="pos626"></a>38	MR NCUBE</p>
<p class="line" id="line627"><a name="pos627"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> Can you disclose that to the Committee?  Can you mention names of people you say were killed by David Mayeko and  this vigilante group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line628"><a name="pos628"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> Yes,  I can.  David Mayeko killed Comrade Nthabi and Comrade Themba Golotile and Comrade Uys(?) and Comrade  Mbuyisile Phiri, many few comrades.</p>
<p class="line" id="line629"><a name="pos629"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> And you were certain that these people you had just mentioned were killed by David Mayeko and this vigilante group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line630"><a name="pos630"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> Yes, I am certain.</p>
<p class="line" id="line631"><a name="pos631"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> It is clear now from your explanation that yourself, yourself I mean the self-defence unit or the ANC Youth League were in two opposing camps with David Mayeko.  And I believe with what they were doing to Khutsong, as a result thereof there was no more peace and stability and all that, but what was the attitude of yourself  as the Youth League towards this vigilante group?  What  did you hope to do and to achieve?</p>
<p class="line" id="line632"><a name="pos632"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> We had intentions of eliminating this group and by doing that we will have established peace in Khutsong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line633"><a name="pos633"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> Mr Ncube, were you armed?  Did yourselves as SDUs possess armaments?</p>
<p class="line" id="line634"><a name="pos634"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> (Answer inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line635"><a name="pos635"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> I hear you say you decided on "wiping"  this other group in order  to bring stability.    How did you hope to achieve that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line636"><a name="pos636"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> We intended to shoot them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line637"><a name="pos637"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> The Committee would like to know how did you intend to shoot them, where will you get the means of shooting them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line638"><a name="pos638"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> We had the armaments to shoot them.  We started</p>
<p class="line" id="line639"><a name="pos639"></a>3	in/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line640"><a name="pos640"></a>39	MR NCUBE</p>
<p class="line" id="line641"><a name="pos641"></a>in the squatter camp and then we got some donations in order</p>
<p class="line" id="line642"><a name="pos642"></a>to buy armaments, so that we can be able to prevent this vigilante group for them to come and kill people furthermore.</p>
<p class="line" id="line643"><a name="pos643"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> So are you creating the impression to this Committee that your SDUs had the support of the community of Khutsong, hence donations for you to buy armaments or weapons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line644"><a name="pos644"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> Yes, it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line645"><a name="pos645"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> Let's go to the day you killed David Mayeko.  I read from your submission before this Committee that there was a time that you were forced to leave your home and sought refuge in Orlando West Methodist Mission.  When did you come back home?</p>
<p class="line" id="line646"><a name="pos646"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> We came back on the 23rd, 23rd  1990.</p>
<p class="line" id="line647"><a name="pos647"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> 23rd of which month?</p>
<p class="line" id="line648"><a name="pos648"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> I don't remember it quite well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line649"><a name="pos649"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> The 23rd December 1990.  Was  it the day before you killed David Mayeko, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line650"><a name="pos650"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> Yes, it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line651"><a name="pos651"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> Can you explain to this Committee how did you kill David Mayeko, Mr Ncube?  Where were you, where was he and how did you kill him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line652"><a name="pos652"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> David Mayeko, when I came back from Orlando on  the 23rd, it was at night when I got home.  I was not satisfied after having seen my parents.  We left the very same night to see the Executive  Committee of Khutsong explaining that we've just come back.   We went to see other comrades within the squatter camp and we had  the ammunition that we already got from the Executive in Khutsong and we  went to see these other comrades.  We used the same road.   3	There/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line653"><a name="pos653"></a>40	MR NCUBE</p>
<p class="line" id="line654"><a name="pos654"></a>There is another section called Xhosa Section.  We used the</p>
<p class="line" id="line655"><a name="pos655"></a>very same road to reach our destination at home.  William Faltein went to his home and I was also heading my home.  We had the guns with us.  And when we arrived at 658 at David Mayeko's we saw this same person getting out of the house with his group, a group of vigilantes and they attacked us.  They took out their guns, do you understand me, Sir?  And I also took my gun out. It was a very long gun, a pump gun, and I shot at him.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line656"><a name="pos656"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> You say David Mayeko was with his other vigilante members.   Are you able  to identify or name these other people who were with David Mayeko?</p>
<p class="line" id="line657"><a name="pos657"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> The people who were  with David Mayeko were a policeman called Mkonza, it was Scarface, Daniel Sgoqo was there and David Maseko and the others were there but I don't know their names.  They are just people I used to see.  They are policemen as well.   I just happened to forget their names.</p>
<p class="line" id="line658"><a name="pos658"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> I believe that Daniel or Mr Sgoqo and Maseko that you mention now, are the ones that you were tried for  having attempted to murder, is it so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line659"><a name="pos659"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line660"><a name="pos660"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> You and Mr Faltein, did you know that the deceased, I am referring at the time when you were to pass this 685 house you mentioned, did you know they may be there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line661"><a name="pos661"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> Yes, we knew that they would be there and we knew that they were in the house, because that was their headquarters where they hid themselves.</p>
<p class="line" id="line662"><a name="pos662"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> Do you say that you armed yourself on that specific day in anticipation of ....(intervention).</p>

<p class="line" id="line665"><a name="pos665"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Is it not better to just ask the witness</p>
<p class="line" id="line666"><a name="pos666"></a>instead of you telling us through the witness why he armed himself?  Would it not weigh a lot more heavier if you were to ask the witness himself to tell us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line667"><a name="pos667"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> I will do so.   Why did you arm yourself that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line668"><a name="pos668"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> At that time we were armed because we were now going to our different homes.  The reason for having arms,  we wanted to defend ourselves with these guns.</p>
<p class="line" id="line669"><a name="pos669"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Where did you get the guns from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line670"><a name="pos670"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> This was a gun donated to the squatter camp by the comrades and the leaders of the ANC, the leaders within the squatter camp.  They bought the gun.</p>
<p class="line" id="line671"><a name="pos671"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Where did you get the gun from that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line672"><a name="pos672"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> I got the gun from the  ANC branch, because the gun had been bought long time ago and it was just there for me to pick.</p>
<p class="line" id="line673"><a name="pos673"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Is this from the ANC Executive Committee?  Where from the ANC?</p>

<p class="line" id="line676"><a name="pos676"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> You told this Committee how you killed David Mayeko.  How did you kill him?  Led to you killing him on that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line677"><a name="pos677"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> On that day he was actually intending to kill us and we had bad blood with this man,  he wanted my head and  he wanted the co-accused's head.   That was the situation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line678"><a name="pos678"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> You said that there was no peace and stability in Khutsong because of the activities of this vigilante group. What happened after the death of David Mayeko, after you killed David Mayeko?</p>

<p class="line" id="line685"><a name="pos685"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> And I believe that was the mission that you hoped to achieve as the ANC at that time,  peace and stability?</p>

<p class="line" id="line692"><a name="pos692"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Was there peace after that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line693"><a name="pos693"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> I would say, yes, but the peace never went on for a long time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line694"><a name="pos694"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DLAVANE:</span> This robbery, why did you rob?   What did you hope to achieve with robbery?  I mean you had running battles with the vigilantes ... (GAP IN RECORDING ON SWITCH-OVER OF TAPE)</p>

<p class="line" id="line720"><a name="pos720"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Before the death of David, how long had you been a member of the SDU?</p>
<p class="line" id="line721"><a name="pos721"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> It was from 1990.  Just from the beginning of 1990.</p>
<p class="line" id="line722"><a name="pos722"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> What was your position in the ANC Youth League?</p>
<p class="line" id="line723"><a name="pos723"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> No, I didn't have any position.</p>

<p class="line" id="line726"><a name="pos726"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Did you report?</p>
<p class="line" id="line727"><a name="pos727"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line728"><a name="pos728"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> What was the content of the report?</p>
<p class="line" id="line729"><a name="pos729"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> The contents were that I am now available in the township because they knew us being away from this township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line730"><a name="pos730"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Did you need to tell this to the Executive  Committee that you are alive and around?</p>
<p class="line" id="line731"><a name="pos731"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> There were reasons for me to tell them that I was now present in the township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line732"><a name="pos732"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> (Question indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line733"><a name="pos733"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> When I arrived back  in the township as a comrade I would  not just go around the streets before reporting this matter to the Executive Committee  so that even in  future when I get killed the Executives would have been in a position to bury me together with the help of the comrades.</p>
<p class="line" id="line734"><a name="pos734"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Did  the Executive know that you were at loggerheads or you were  fighting with the vigilante?</p>
<p class="line" id="line735"><a name="pos735"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> Yes, it knew very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line736"><a name="pos736"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> And did it know the reason why you were fighting?</p>

<p class="line" id="line739"><a name="pos739"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> It knew the reason for our fighting.  The reason</p>
<p class="line" id="line740"><a name="pos740"></a>for our fighting was that we as the comrades were really supporting the struggle and we wanted the political activists to be free and on the other side the vigilantes  were against such actions.  That is where the conflict started and there was fighting and no negotiations of  any kind took place. </p>
<p class="line" id="line741"><a name="pos741"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> You knew well the vigilantes were against political activity.  Is that all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line742"><a name="pos742"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> That's correct, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line743"><a name="pos743"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Did the vigilantes at any given moment prescribe to you as to what type of political activity you are or you were to be engaged in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line744"><a name="pos744"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> No, they never took initiatives to tell us what political activities meant to them.  They didn't want us to gather together in rallies, they didn't want us to demonstrate in the street.    They didn't want  us to bury  our comrades in peace and in democracy.  They would come  and  disrupt everything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line745"><a name="pos745"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> The vigilantes were some form of a political organisation or movement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line746"><a name="pos746"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> Yes,  but I don't know you know as Themba,  but there was a comrade of ours  but he  passed away and he requested the leaders of the vigilantes to explain why were they killing the comrades and which political organisation they belonged to and they said they worked with the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line747"><a name="pos747"></a>In other words, they didn't join any  political organisation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line748"><a name="pos748"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> ... when this was said to your deceased comrades?</p>
<p class="line" id="line749"><a name="pos749"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> No, I wasn't there.</p>

<p class="line" id="line752"><a name="pos752"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> In your own knowledge,  do you know of these</p>
<p class="line" id="line753"><a name="pos753"></a>vigilantes as belonging to any political organisation or movement or liberation movement, in your own knowledge?</p>
<p class="line" id="line754"><a name="pos754"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> I don't think they belonged to any organisation. I don't even know of any organisation they belonged to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line755"><a name="pos755"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> And you say to this Committee that they were  just a group and had nothing to do with politics whatsoever.</p>
<p class="line" id="line756"><a name="pos756"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> Sir, I would agree with what you are saying as you've put your question.  They were just a group killing the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line757"><a name="pos757"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Can you still perhaps venture a ... and say the vigilantes were actually a criminal gang.  Will you agree to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line758"><a name="pos758"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> I would agree to that,  Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line759"><a name="pos759"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> And in your position as SDUs, you were actually fighting  a criminal element  within your community and not a political organisation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line760"><a name="pos760"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> We were fighting the criminals.</p>
<p class="line" id="line761"><a name="pos761"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> You testified that at the time when David was shot, he was in the company of police officers, amongst others,  Konstabel Mkhize, Scarface and others, do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line762"><a name="pos762"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> I remember, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line763"><a name="pos763"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> When you saw David in the company of these police officers, what came into your mind?</p>
<p class="line" id="line764"><a name="pos764"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> When I saw this person in the company of policemen attacking me, I thought I was going to be killed on that day, because they were close to me and I thought they now got hold of me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line765"><a name="pos765"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> How did they attack you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line766"><a name="pos766"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> They got out of 685 yard at the gate, they were</p>

<p class="line" id="line768"><a name="pos768"></a>46	MR NCUBE</p>

<p class="line" id="line770"><a name="pos770"></a>together with my co-accused and as they were heading for us they jumped the first street and I decided to take another corner with the gun that I had in my hand.   And when they appeared on the corner I fired a shot.  And after shooting the deceased fell and the others turned their backs and  they ran away and I didn't shoot any more.   And when Sgoqo and Maseko pointed their guns at me they realised that mine was still facing them, it was still pointed at them, and  they decided to run away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line771"><a name="pos771"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> They fired no shots at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line772"><a name="pos772"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> I only shot once.</p>
<p class="line" id="line773"><a name="pos773"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> They fired no shots  at all.   The deceased didn't fire any shots at you, none of his party fired at you, is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line774"><a name="pos774"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> They never shot at us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line775"><a name="pos775"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Did the deceased give chase to any of you before you could shoot him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line776"><a name="pos776"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> Yes, he chased us for quite a long time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line777"><a name="pos777"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Who was in your company at the time  when the deceased was chasing you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line778"><a name="pos778"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> At the time when he was facing us, can you repeat yourself?  Are you referring to the question,  to the day when the deceased chased us?  I was together with my co-accused and the other comrades, but some of them had been killed  while we were busy with the funeral proceedings of another comrade and the deceased came to the funeral.  It was a Friday, we were at a night vigil.</p>

<p class="line" id="line786"><a name="pos786"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> No, he chased us days before.  On that day we killed him I just saw him at about four o'clock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line787"><a name="pos787"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> ... the date of his death?</p>
<p class="line" id="line788"><a name="pos788"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> Not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line789"><a name="pos789"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Four  o'clock in the afternoon was it, when you just saw him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line790"><a name="pos790"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> Yes, that is correct, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line791"><a name="pos791"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> ... when you shot the deceased, how far was he from you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line792"><a name="pos792"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> He was present.</p>

<p class="line" id="line794"><a name="pos794"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> How can I estimate the distance?  Do you see that cameraman?  He was just there and I was here at this table that I am sitting at now.  It was just that distance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line795"><a name="pos795"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Four to five paces.   At the time when  you shot at the deceased what did Mr Faltein do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line796"><a name="pos796"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> He also had his firearm in his hand.  He was kneeling with his knee but I never heard any shot from his gun, really.</p>
<p class="line" id="line797"><a name="pos797"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> As you say, he had knelt down, he was on his knees and he had produced his gun.  Would you say the manner in which he held his gun and the manner in which he knelt  down he was about to do something with the gun?</p>
<p class="line" id="line798"><a name="pos798"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> That's correct, he was going to use the gun.</p>

<p class="line" id="line804"><a name="pos804"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> Nothing, Sir.  He did nothing to the deceased.</p>
<p class="line" id="line805"><a name="pos805"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> After you had killed the deceased, what did you do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line806"><a name="pos806"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> I just stood and looked at him and I was telling myself he didn't know what he was doing.   I didn't run away after shooting him, I just stood and I walked away after a few minutes.  The township was now jubilant.  People were really shouting words of happiness.  There was peace in the township.  People were happy after the incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line807"><a name="pos807"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> We are talking about the incident itself, at the time of the shooting.  Not what happened after the shooting.  You say that after you shot him you stood there, you looked at him and you walked away.  You did nothing else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line808"><a name="pos808"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> Nothing else, Sir</p>
<p class="line" id="line809"><a name="pos809"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> If we can be told by a witness a deed that has been done, that it is the deceased who first gave chase on you people and whilst chasing you, you turned around and shot at him, will that be correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line810"><a name="pos810"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> That the deceased chased me and I turn around and shot at him, yes, that's correct, Sir, because when they came out of 658 they had their guns in their hands and they said there are the comrades, let us shoot at him and they said there is Themba, they knew us very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line811"><a name="pos811"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Going back a little bit as to the shooting itself and the circumstances thereof, I get the impression that you shot at the deceased you shot the deceased at the time when you were on your way to go and report to the Executive Committee, am I correct?</p>

<p class="line" id="line840"><a name="pos840"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Finally, the killing of David Mayeko, was it</p>
<p class="line" id="line841"><a name="pos841"></a>ever discussed at an ANC meeting or an SDU meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line842"><a name="pos842"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Before the incident or after the incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line843"><a name="pos843"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Before the incident.  Was it ever discussed that this man has got to be removed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line844"><a name="pos844"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> Yes, at school we used to talk about this David Mayeko issue, that was before he was killed.  You know some of the comrades at school were talking about this issue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line845"><a name="pos845"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> If this was discussed by the leadership either of the self-defence unit or the ANC Executive or the ANC Youth League?</p>
<p class="line" id="line846"><a name="pos846"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> No, I only heard it being discussed at school as a member of the ANC Youth League and I was supposed to be present and listening to what the discussion was all about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line847"><a name="pos847"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Neither the self-defence unit nor the Khutsong branch ANC nor the ANC Youth League ever discussed the death of Mayeko.  Is that what I should gather from you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line848"><a name="pos848"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> No, it is not that way,  Sir.  The way I explained this, I was still schooling and many students died and that is why I say to you this issue was discussed at school that this man has finished the community and he has finished the students, he has to follow them, he has to be removed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line849"><a name="pos849"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Mr Ncube, I am talking about structures, well-known structures, whether this was discussed at any of the three structures?  I am not referring to the township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line850"><a name="pos850"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> No, I never heard of this in the ANC offices, I have never heard of any discussion of any kind.</p>
<p class="line" id="line851"><a name="pos851"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> The SDUs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line852"><a name="pos852"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> I also heard it from the self-defence units.</p>

<p class="line" id="line855"><a name="pos855"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Why does it take you so long really to come</p>
<p class="line" id="line856"><a name="pos856"></a>to such simple answers?  Now when was it discussed by the SDUs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line857"><a name="pos857"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> We were patrolling at night and as we were busy patrolling we were talking about this issue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line858"><a name="pos858"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> ... find out whether this was decided or discussed at a meeting and a decision taken.  That is what you are really after, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line859"><a name="pos859"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Was this discussed or decided upon at any meeting of a formal structure?</p>
<p class="line" id="line860"><a name="pos860"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> I think I can always say that the killing of David Mayeko was discussed by the SDU, the self-defence units as we were patrolling, but the decisions I never came to know as to whether Mayeko was supposed to be killed or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line861"><a name="pos861"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Let's try for the last time.  The discussion by the SDU, was it done at a meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line862"><a name="pos862"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> Not in a meeting, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line863"><a name="pos863"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> By pumping David Mayeko with a pump gun, what did you want to achieve?</p>
<p class="line" id="line864"><a name="pos864"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> I wanted peace from this man.</p>
<p class="line" id="line865"><a name="pos865"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> I got the impression that you shot him because you were afraid that he was going to shoot you.  Is that the reason?</p>
<p class="line" id="line866"><a name="pos866"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> No, I was just trying to tell the Committee that their attack was in such a position that I was also supposed to defend myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line867"><a name="pos867"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> In your response to the Chairperson you say you were defending yourself, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line868"><a name="pos868"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> That's correct.</p>

<p class="line" id="line873"><a name="pos873"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> I want to put it to you finally that when you killed David the aim was not to achieve any peace nor stability to defend yourself, and I am going to read from your application what you said at page 4 thereof, it will be the eighth line from the bottom of page 4, Mr Chairman and members of the Committee.  If the Chair allows me I will read that portion</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line874"><a name="pos874"></a>"On the 24th December 1990 I was on my way to see my parents as I was nostalgic.

<p class="line" id="line878"><a name="pos878"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> Sir, it is not that way.  Let me tell you the right version.  I was heading for my home on the day I shot Mayeko.   It was my intention to go home using the same street.  Now when I was in the same road, 658, it is a road that I use when I go to school, when I go anywhere, and when I was in that street this group of men, David Mayeko, Constable Makonza, Scarface and Daniel Sgoqo and David Maseko, they went out of this 658 and they attacked me together with ny co-accused because they saw we were heading for the direction where I stayed and when they pulled out</p>

<p class="line" id="line882"><a name="pos882"></a>these people are going to kill me because they hunt me at night and they hunt me during the day, not knowing the reasons therefor, and I decided to take out my gun.  I pointed it at them and I shot.  That is the story.</p>

<p class="line" id="line991"><a name="pos991"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line992"><a name="pos992"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> I am a little confused because you told us a short while ago, as I understood your evidence, that at school you used to talk about the deceased and the vigilantes, but you left school before they came.  Can you explain?</p>
<p class="line" id="line993"><a name="pos993"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> Can I explain?   I was not studying any more.  I used to go to the school to pay my comrades a visit because even in school there was a lot of harassment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line994"><a name="pos994"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Who was clothing you in the meantime, supplied your clothes and food?</p>
<p class="line" id="line995"><a name="pos995"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> The person who was clothing me, giving me food I do not just understand what kind of a question is this.  Do you refer to now or when I was still an infant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line996"><a name="pos996"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> I know the Government is clothing you now in prison, but before you went to prison.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1002"><a name="pos1002"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> I was doing everything for myself.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1004"><a name="pos1004"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> No, I wasn't working.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1005"><a name="pos1005"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Is that why you robbed the vehicles?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1006"><a name="pos1006"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1007"><a name="pos1007"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> In order to clothe yourself and to have food to eat.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1009"><a name="pos1009"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> I believe that as a member of the SDU you were instructed to defend the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1010"><a name="pos1010"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1011"><a name="pos1011"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Was that the reason why you were given that firearm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1012"><a name="pos1012"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> That's the reason, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1013"><a name="pos1013"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> How were you to defend the community, were there limits to it?  Could you for example kill other people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1014"><a name="pos1014"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> No, I would never kill people who do not have anything against me, innocent people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1015"><a name="pos1015"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> What about people who were not innocent?  I am trying to find out from you whether you understood your instructions from the SDU or whatever when they gave you the firearm, I want to know from you whether you understood that to mean that should the need arise you should use that gun and if necessary in defence kill.  That is all I want to find out from you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1016"><a name="pos1016"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> Yes, there were such decisions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1017"><a name="pos1017"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> But no particular person was targeted as to be killed.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1021"><a name="pos1021"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> I understand that you were living in Soweto from 1988 to 1990, is that correct?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1025"><a name="pos1025"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> And you left home, as I understand your evidence, and you went to live at Soweto, is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1026"><a name="pos1026"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> I just went to Soweto, you know, just to go and take a few rounds and come back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1027"><a name="pos1027"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Oh, you didn't go and live.  I understood from what you said to my brother that when you went to live with Father Paul in Soweto.  You took refuge with him, you told us many comrades took refuge with him and they were all members of the ANC Youth League, but now you say you didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1028"><a name="pos1028"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> I was staying at Father Paul's place.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1030"><a name="pos1030"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> I spent about two months at Father Paul's mission, two to three months.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1031"><a name="pos1031"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> And then where did you go?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1032"><a name="pos1032"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> From Father Paul's mission I came back to the township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1033"><a name="pos1033"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> And did you from then on support yourself by robbing and stealing, is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1034"><a name="pos1034"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> That's not correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1035"><a name="pos1035"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Well, you didn't work.  You were asked if anybody supported you and you gave no name.   Will you tell us how you supported yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1036"><a name="pos1036"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> I have parents, parents were taking care of me.  Those were the people who were giving me food and every time 4	when/...</p>

<p class="line" id="line1038"><a name="pos1038"></a>when I went to them to cry they would help. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1039"><a name="pos1039"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> You didn't say that a few minutes ago.  Why were you so hesitant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1040"><a name="pos1040"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> As I tell you I have parents who help me when I do not have anything.  They help me in such a way - they even helped me when I was from Father Paul's mission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1041"><a name="pos1041"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> I have no information direct myself, I am merely looking at the documents that have been put up, and in there the document dealing with your record it says that the person you killed was 18 years old at the time, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1042"><a name="pos1042"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1043"><a name="pos1043"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Was he still at school?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1044"><a name="pos1044"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> In which year, Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1045"><a name="pos1045"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> In the year that he was killed, 1990.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1046"><a name="pos1046"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> I was not schooling in 1990.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1047"><a name="pos1047"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Was he at school, the young man you killed, Mayeko?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1048"><a name="pos1048"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1049"><a name="pos1049"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> But he was only 18.  You told us that you came home on the night of the 23rd December, is that correct?   At about what time did you come home?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1050"><a name="pos1050"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> It was round about seven to eight o'clock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1051"><a name="pos1051"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> And did you go the same night to the Executive Committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1052"><a name="pos1052"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> Yes, I went to the Executive Committee the same night because I didn't have any time to stay at home.  I suspected that any time people might come to pick me up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1053"><a name="pos1053"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> And did you take William Faltein with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1054"><a name="pos1054"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1055"><a name="pos1055"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> What time did you get to the Executive</p>

<p class="line" id="line1059"><a name="pos1059"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> I didn't have a watch at that time, I can't tell.  I didn't even ask time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1060"><a name="pos1060"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Was it during the course of the night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1061"><a name="pos1061"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1062"><a name="pos1062"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> And they issued you with the one gun which we've heard was a pumpgun shotgun.  Did they issue your friend William with a gun?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1063"><a name="pos1063"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1064"><a name="pos1064"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> You were each  issued with a gun that evening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1065"><a name="pos1065"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> I received a gun.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1066"><a name="pos1066"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> And so did William, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1067"><a name="pos1067"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> I do not know, because I just saw him having a gun.  I got the gun on the same night but I don't know about Faltein, but I just saw him in possession of a gun.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1068"><a name="pos1068"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> And how long did you stay there?  Did you stay the whole night there or did you leave during the course of the night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1069"><a name="pos1069"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> The same night we went back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1070"><a name="pos1070"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Went back home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1071"><a name="pos1071"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1072"><a name="pos1072"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> So you got home that night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1073"><a name="pos1073"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> Not at home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1074"><a name="pos1074"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> What did you do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1075"><a name="pos1075"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> We went to the squatter camp to other comrades.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1076"><a name="pos1076"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> You weren't anxious to get home, you went to the squatter camp and you spent the next day there, did you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1077"><a name="pos1077"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> I have already seen my parents and there were other friends of mine whom I did not see before, and I decided to go straight to the hiding place together with the 4	other/..</p>

<p class="line" id="line1080"><a name="pos1080"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> But wasn't that where you were living, in the squatter camp?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1081"><a name="pos1081"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> No, that was just my hiding place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1082"><a name="pos1082"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Well where were you living?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1083"><a name="pos1083"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> I was staying in the same street with my co-accused, No 652.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1084"><a name="pos1084"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Were you staying with him and you decided to go home again the next afternoon, did you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1085"><a name="pos1085"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1086"><a name="pos1086"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> I am asking you this because in your amnesty application form you referred to how you were feeling nostalgic and wanted to see your parents.  But you had seen them the night before, hadn't you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1087"><a name="pos1087"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> Yes, I had seen them, that is my father and my mother.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1088"><a name="pos1088"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> And you arrived at 658, the deceased's home, that afternoon, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1089"><a name="pos1089"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1090"><a name="pos1090"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> And on your version, as I understand it, nobody, neither he nor any of his friends fired a shot, but you killed him, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1091"><a name="pos1091"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1092"><a name="pos1092"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> But you say you were doing it in self-defence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1093"><a name="pos1093"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> I was defending myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1094"><a name="pos1094"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> That's despite the fact that the deceased was accompanied by three policemen, each of whom was armed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1095"><a name="pos1095"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> That's correct, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1096"><a name="pos1096"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> And none of them fired at you.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1100"><a name="pos1100"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Mr Ncube, in your evidence you stated that you</p>
<p class="line" id="line1101"><a name="pos1101"></a>were given the pump gun by the ANC prior to December 1990, at least on the 24th December.  I am not sure whether I understood your evidence in that regard, when were you given the gun by the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1102"><a name="pos1102"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> The pump gun was at all times present.  That is the first rifle I was given.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1103"><a name="pos1103"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Was it always in your possession, or at times you had to return it to the Executive?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1104"><a name="pos1104"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> We used to take it back to the Executive to be stored.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1105"><a name="pos1105"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Now how many people were given firearms by the Executive for purposes of protecting the community?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1106"><a name="pos1106"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> When I received this I was just concerned about myself.  I only saw other comrades in possession of guns not knowing when were they given guns.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1107"><a name="pos1107"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> But were those guns given to members of the SDU by the Executive branch of the ANC, to your knowledge?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1108"><a name="pos1108"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> Yes, according to my knowledge, that is the correct version.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1109"><a name="pos1109"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> You knew the deceased for quite some time, you actually grew up together.  When did he become a gangster?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1110"><a name="pos1110"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> He started in the same year, 1990.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1111"><a name="pos1111"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Prior thereto he was not involved in any criminal activity?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1112"><a name="pos1112"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> No, prior to that he wasn't just a criminal.  He was just playing gambling games.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1113"><a name="pos1113"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> When did your area experience a period of instability, that is Khutsong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1114"><a name="pos1114"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> At the Xhosa section the conflict started in 1990.  It was in 1990.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1117"><a name="pos1117"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> And what was the cause of the instability?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1118"><a name="pos1118"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> This conflict between ourselves and these men was because of a few reasons that I've mentioned earlier on, that the ANC wanted free political activities.  We wanted to have meetings, we wanted to conduct our funerals in our way, but things never turned out to be that way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1119"><a name="pos1119"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> I am just trying to reconcile your evidence.  You've stated that you had to leave your area in 1988 to seek refuge in Orlando West because your life was in danger.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1120"><a name="pos1120"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1121"><a name="pos1121"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Your life was in danger in 1988 not because of the activities of the vigilante group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1122"><a name="pos1122"></a><span class="speaker">MR NCUBE:</span> That is correct.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1137"><a name="pos1137"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1138"><a name="pos1138"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> They were members of, what you are complaining is they were the members of the African National Congress, Youth Congress and further you are complaining that it is true that you was a member of the executive committee of the ANC at that time, is that so?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1144"><a name="pos1144"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> They are serving sentences for having killed a certain Mr Majeko who they alleged to have been the leader of this vigilante group.   Did you know this David Majeko, you as Mr Ndzeku?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1145"><a name="pos1145"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1146"><a name="pos1146"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Is it true that this Mr David Majeko was the leader of this vigilante group in Kusong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1147"><a name="pos1147"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I won't say a leader as such but he was one of the prominent members of the vigilante group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1148"><a name="pos1148"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> They mentioned that this vigilante group was on the campaign of stabilisation in Kusong, names were mentioned before the Committee that was said were killed by this vigilante group, rob and rape, can you confirm what this vigilante group was doing in Kusong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1149"><a name="pos1149"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes it is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1150"><a name="pos1150"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> What did they do from your knowledge?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1151"><a name="pos1151"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> They were actually conducting a reign of terror in the township, killing community members, maiming some and gene-rally subjecting to the township to a reign of lawlessness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1152"><a name="pos1152"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> They killed David Majeko they informed this Committee that they did so and they were in fact acting under the auspices...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1153"><a name="pos1153"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> They did not do so, one of them said he shot, the other one said he did nothing at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1154"><a name="pos1154"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> As the member of this Committee is saying, we had to attitudes, William Fortuin who said that he was involved but he did not do anything and Johnson Ncube who shot at the deceased.   At the time they told this Committee that they were acting in their capacity and under the auspices of the ANC and the executive committee of the ANC.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1158"><a name="pos1158"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> Who is that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1159"><a name="pos1159"></a><span class="speaker">ATTORNEY::</span> The executive committee of the ANC Youth League.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1160"><a name="pos1160"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Just to get the thing in context did I understand the evidence wrongly, I got the impression that they said that they had no intention to kill this man, it is when this man came there with others who were armed and he feared that he might be killed that that is why he opened fire and killed the man.   He was not acting under anybody's instructions at the time because he'd not anticipated killing this man.   Is that not what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1161"><a name="pos1161"></a><span class="speaker">ATTORNEY::</span> Chairperson the question maybe should have been that when they were acting against the group generally, acting against the vigilantes they were acting as members of the organisation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1162"><a name="pos1162"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> The evidence was that on this day they were on their way home, you are now trying to put a completely different version as you did when you led the witnesses.  Will you please not put matters as fact, as you were now doing to this witness, the evidence we heard was that they were going home.   They had no intention of doing anything and this man rushed out of his house at them, is that not so?   Is that not the evidence they gave?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1163"><a name="pos1163"></a><span class="speaker">ATTORNEY::</span> Chairperson that is the evidence they gave, it is when I refer to the actual commission of the offence, they were acting then as it has been described by the Chairperson, but like I'm saying the question should have been that when they were acting against the group of vigilantes generally so.   I accept the clarification thereof and I will refrain from asking a question in that</p>

<p class="line" id="line1167"><a name="pos1167"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> From the information that we had at the time was that they were donations which were made particularly among the informal settlement communities, whereby arms were then purchased through those donations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1168"><a name="pos1168"></a><span class="speaker">MS ............::</span> Mr Ndzeku, the group that you are referring to is it the vigilante group or are you referring to members of the SDU, I'm a little confused?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1169"><a name="pos1169"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> The members of the SDU.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1170"><a name="pos1170"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> So it is so that the community as you mentioned were in total support of these members of the SDU's?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1188"><a name="pos1188"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Are you aware of any decision taken by the SDU on how members of the vigilante group should be dealt with?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1190"><a name="pos1190"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1191"><a name="pos1191"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Mr Ndzeku you said you know Mr Fortuin and Ngcube, could you be specific to us and tell us in what capacity did you know them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1192"><a name="pos1192"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> At that time in question there were members of the youth league, the ANC youth league in Kusong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1193"><a name="pos1193"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> And you did certainly did testify that you knew the deceased David Mayeko?   What is it that made you know this man specifically, what made him prominent?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1194"><a name="pos1194"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> It was the fact that he was notorious.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1195"><a name="pos1195"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> He was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1196"><a name="pos1196"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> He was notorious in the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1197"><a name="pos1197"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Would you say by being notorious you mean that he was a criminal in the area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1198"><a name="pos1198"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1199"><a name="pos1199"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Did he belong to any political organisation or movement or body?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1200"><a name="pos1200"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> He did not belong to a political organisation but he was a member of the vigilante group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1201"><a name="pos1201"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Would I be incorrect if I said this vigilante group of which he was a member was taking any member of the community, irrespective of political convictions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1202"><a name="pos1202"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> We are (indistinct) were actually directed mostly towards the political activists, especially the youth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1203"><a name="pos1203"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> No I believe the Committee would like to know more about that, what makes you say that threats were directed against activists?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1205"><a name="pos1205"></a>69	D NDZEKU</p>
<p class="line" id="line1206"><a name="pos1206"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Maybe I would, it would help the Commission maybe if I would put the whole scenario in its correct perspective?   What actually happened was it was the end of 1989, there was a group of youth that broke away, actually defected from the ANC Youth League.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1207"><a name="pos1207"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> A group of youth did what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1208"><a name="pos1208"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> Defected.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1209"><a name="pos1209"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Defected from the ANC Youth League and then embarked, and then embarked on a reign of terror, terrorising the community, killing and maiming in the process.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1210"><a name="pos1210"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Do you know the reason why this group broke away from the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1211"><a name="pos1211"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I don't know of any specific reason.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1212"><a name="pos1212"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> You may continue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1213"><a name="pos1213"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Thereafter, what actually happened was most of the attacks were then directed towards the business people who in turn some of the business people formed themselves, organised themselves into a vigilante group with a purpose of defending their properties.   In the process the whole game changed whereby their attacks became more and more concentrated and aimed at the political activists.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1214"><a name="pos1214"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> Whose attacks were these, the defectors from the ANC or the vigilantes from the business community?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1215"><a name="pos1215"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> The vigilantes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1216"><a name="pos1216"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> There were still the defectors from the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1217"><a name="pos1217"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I beg your pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1218"><a name="pos1218"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> There were still a group of defectors from the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1219"><a name="pos1219"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1220"><a name="pos1220"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> What happened to them?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1223"><a name="pos1223"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> What I'm saying was the group that formed themselves into the vigilantes were then in war against this small group of defectors, but in the process their attacks were not only aimed at those defectors, that small group of thugs, it spread over to include and to concentrate more on the political activists.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1224"><a name="pos1224"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Just for clarity's sake Mr Ndzeku, are you now saying that some of the members of the vigilante group were businessmen in the area, is that what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1225"><a name="pos1225"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Originally that was the set-up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1226"><a name="pos1226"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Right, no as it went on, with the inclusion of the known people like David Mayeko, were there still businessmen amongst the vigilantes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1227"><a name="pos1227"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> No, the composition of the vigilante group took a different turn altogether when they were joined by thugs such as the person you mentioned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1228"><a name="pos1228"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Mr Ndzeku, when did this vigilante group come into existence, which consisted initially of business people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1229"><a name="pos1229"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That was early 89, early 90 sorry yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1230"><a name="pos1230"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Mr Ndzeku you say that this group of vigilante of which David Mayeko was a member, would you say there was any authority that controlled them or gave them instructions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1231"><a name="pos1231"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I won't know of the authority behind their actions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1232"><a name="pos1232"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Would you regard them perhaps as just a gang of criminals terrorising the township?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1233"><a name="pos1233"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I would rather say they were just a group, a gang of thugs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1234"><a name="pos1234"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Names like Scarface and more specifically a</p>

<p class="line" id="line1237"><a name="pos1237"></a>person called Constable Nkonsa, does it make any sense to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1238"><a name="pos1238"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Constable Nkonsa I know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1239"><a name="pos1239"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> How do you know Constable Nkonsa in relation to the vigilantes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1240"><a name="pos1240"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> He was one of the policemen who were seen to be colluding with the vigilantes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1241"><a name="pos1241"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> And Scarface?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1242"><a name="pos1242"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Scarface as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1243"><a name="pos1243"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> How do you come to conclude that they were colluding with the vigilantes, what had you seen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1244"><a name="pos1244"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> From the statements that we took from the youth, in collaboration with members of the Human Rights Commission, it became very clear that the police were arming this vigilante group and in many occasions they were seen in their company which led the community to be convinced that they were in cahoots with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1245"><a name="pos1245"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Has you yourself Mr Ndzeku seen the police in the company of this vigilante group?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1249"><a name="pos1249"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Did you see them in the company of the vigilante just as friends drinking together or perhaps having a  (indistinct) or under what circumstances would you say they were together?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1251"><a name="pos1251"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Yes you have mentioned them but you have not mentioned what I've said now.   I will repeat, did you see them together just as friends or as people bent on doing</p>

<p class="line" id="line1255"><a name="pos1255"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> They were moving together, personally I haven't seen them committing any action or act together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1256"><a name="pos1256"></a><span class="speaker">MR (?)::</span> I'm always surprised, not that I'm inhibiting your cross-examination, it always baffles me that witnesses are expected to, in support of an allegation with the police, are always expected to, almost expected to say that we did see these people actually committing an offence with the police.   How can the policeman ever openly and publicly commit crimes in collusion with criminals?   I'm not referring to your question in particular, it's just a general observation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1257"><a name="pos1257"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Mr Ndzeku do you a person by the name of Captain Van Graan, he was mentioned by Fortuin?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1259"><a name="pos1259"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> What do you know about him in relation to the vigilante group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1260"><a name="pos1260"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> What I know was that he was a Captain at the local police station, at the Welfortuin(?) police station.   Personally I haven't seen him in the company of the said group.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1267"><a name="pos1267"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> His evidence appeared to indicate that this gun was kept by the ANC executive committee and that he was given it on more than one occasion by them.   Was it the practice of the ANC executive committee to keep firearms and to issue them to people?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1271"><a name="pos1271"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Is it possible therefore that the executive committee which was referred to might have been the one of the South African Youth League?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1473"><a name="pos1473"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> But if they wanted to protect, they were an open group formed in order to protect against crime I would presume they would have acted in collusion with the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1474"><a name="pos1474"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That was not what happened, you see because there were perceptions that the police were doing nothing to curb the crimes committed against the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1475"><a name="pos1475"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> I see, so they formed a separate committee or group in order to protect the public from the gangsters or the thieves or the criminals in the area?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1517"><a name="pos1517"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> It could have been the executive of the Youth League but I'm not sure exactly who.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1522"><a name="pos1522"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> The local branch executive of the ANC?</p>

The reports were tabled yesterday afternoon just shortly before the adjournment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1541"><a name="pos1541"></a><span class="speaker">ADVOCATE DE JAGER::</span> Mr Mpshe, the deceased David Majeko, did he have any family, a father, a mother, he's been at school here would nobody know about his family or his next-of-kin?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1542"><a name="pos1542"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE::</span> Mr Chairman if I recall the contents of the report from the investigative unit, it is to the effect - and I'm not quoting verbatim - that the people during this harassment and maiming and killing, moved out of the area because that was an informal settlement and they cannot be traced.   They even enlisted the services of Mr Nzdeku who is now the mayor in that area but he was also unsuccessful in tracing the next-of-kin to the deceased.   Those are the contents of the report.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1548"><a name="pos1548"></a><span class="speaker">ATTORNEY::</span> Yes Mr Chairperson that was the evidence but as the Chair will well know, it is a investigative unit was given an instruction to go and trace these people, and I depend on their reports.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1549"><a name="pos1549"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> They seem to have passed the buck to somebody else, they've not gone to the place and walked up and down the street asking people if they were still living there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1550"><a name="pos1550"></a><span class="speaker">ATTORNEY::</span> It did seem the impression that I get is that they went to the police station, perused their police docket and made some enquiries and even got in touch with the then witness Mr Ndzeku who is the mayor there who also tried to assist them in tracing the next of kin but unfortunately that was unsuccessful as well.   That is the distance that they travelled.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1551"><a name="pos1551"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> Has your request been put to the audience Mr De Jager, that is if there is anybody here who knows?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1552"><a name="pos1552"></a><span class="speaker">ATTORNEY::</span> Sorry Mr Chairman can I do this via Mr Ndzeku who is the mayor of the area, I will consult with him and make him make this known because the audience here is not the audience from that area, this is the local audience.   He is the best person who can convey this to the people in that area.   I am not divulging from my (indistinct) but I thought it would be most apposite to deal with it because he is the mayor in that area, if that is permitted.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1556"><a name="pos1556"></a>what you have to say on this point, and that is there has been a great deal of evidence of police harassment and police collusion with groups operating in townships.   Do you have any facts before you that would negative that kind of evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1557"><a name="pos1557"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE::</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1558"><a name="pos1558"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Do you have any attitude on the matter as to what weight has to be attached to this kind of allegation about police working in collusion with illegal elements and gangsters and so on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1559"><a name="pos1559"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE::</span> Mr Chairman I do not have specific attitude pertaining to this type of a matter, that is these matters, but the attitude that I may be having will be of a general nature which I do not think will be of any assistance to this Committee as to what happens generally outside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1560"><a name="pos1560"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> Have the police been notified that such allegations are expected, have they been asked to comment or given the opportunity to comment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1561"><a name="pos1561"></a><span class="speaker">ATTORNEY::</span> Mr Chairman the report that I tabled yesterday from the investigative unit, one of the paragraphs states that because of the absence of the case docket, they could not formulate as to the attitude of the police towards the activists, and as such they could not make out what actually was happening in that area, save that there was a fight or a skirmish between the vigilante and the activists.   That is how far the investigative unit could report.</p>

They are presently in Kusong township.   Mr Chairman I have caused, or I have enlisted the services of the SAPS to go and fetch the mother as well as the sister and as I am talking now they have left for the same.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1568"><a name="pos1568"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> Thank you very much.   Obviously you are not in a position to give us any indication as to when we can resume with this particular case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1569"><a name="pos1569"></a><span class="speaker">ATTORNEY::</span> Mr Chairman correctly so, I am not in a position to state that and that furthermore I have caused a letter to be written which is about to be despatched to the Kusong and/or Carltonville police station calling upon the policemen whose names were mentioned in evidence also to be present.   As such Mr Chairman we are not in a position to close this matter at this time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1570"><a name="pos1570"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> The Committee has had a preliminary discussion in this regard and it has been suggested and agreed by members of the Committee that in all future applications where you know beforehand that allegations of police involvement are going to be made by witnesses, that due notice is given to the relevant police authorities that this is what is likely to be said and that they are afforded an opportunity to be present at the hearing or make representations in whichever way they like, so that things may run a little more smoothly in future.   In future it should be said to General Fivaz himself and let him attend to deciding who should represent him at these hearings.   As</p>

<p class="line" id="line1572"><a name="pos1572"></a>90	P LEBONA</p>
<p class="line" id="line1573"><a name="pos1573"></a>far as the present application is concerned, we will defer further discussion until we're in a position to know whether witnesses are available and maybe at the end of the day or perhaps at the beginning of the next hearing tomorrow morning, we may be able to decide whether we should postpone altogether a further consideration of this application to enable the police to make adequate representation or arrive at some other decision.   ...to the policemen's names who have been mentioned may not serve the desired purpose, they may very well want a transcript of the evidence to know what is being said about them and then take legal advice on it before they decide to appear.   It seems that the proper thing to do would be, apart from serving notice on them or notifying them, the proper thing to do would be to send the letter to the police Commissioner, the General Commissioner and leave it in his hands.   That having been said, we will now hold in abeyance the hearing of further evidence in the present applications and may we now proceed with the next application if we are ready to do so?

<p class="line" id="line1592"><a name="pos1592"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Duties assigned to us as ANC marshals we were supposed to bring order during our mass meetings.   There was  gun that I used to carry every time when we had meetings, but after the meeting I would take it back to Comrade Papi(?).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1593"><a name="pos1593"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Your duties as an ANC marshall you are saying were mainly to restore order in meetings?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1597"><a name="pos1597"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> This Zenzile Lamini you murdered, who was he, how did you know him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1598"><a name="pos1598"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> The Zenzile we killed I knew him as our own comrade, he was at first a member of the ANC and it so happened that Zenzile resigned from the ANC and he joined his own gangster that was called Kofifi, the gangster was called Kofifi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1599"><a name="pos1599"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Why did you kill Zenzile, why did you kill this Mr Lamini?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1600"><a name="pos1600"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> On 21 July there was a mass meeting in the</p>
<p class="line" id="line1601"><a name="pos1601"></a>2.	township /...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1602"><a name="pos1602"></a>92	P LEBONA</p>
<p class="line" id="line1603"><a name="pos1603"></a>township that is Ganana.   At that time I had a firearm with me together with other comrades and as we were in the proceedings of the mass meetings we were discussing about the crime that was present in the township and as we were discussing a few comrades arrived and they told us of the problems that Zenzile have done.   They were reporting this to the comrades at a mass meetings and the marshals were chosen out of the mass meeting to go and fetch him.   That was on the day when we had our meeting.   I was among the group who went to fetch Zenzile.   We went to his place in his shack where he was staying, and when we came back with him he confessed that he was, to Mrs (indistinct) house on the 20th and he demanded money and when this woman told him that she didn't have money, he took the decision to rape Mrs (indistinct) together with his friends, his gangster friends.    They fastened Mrs (indistinct) husband and they raped her, then Zenzile after finishing this act, took a stone and threw it to this woman and he confessed with his own mouth that those were the acts committed by him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1604"><a name="pos1604"></a><span class="speaker">MEMBER OF COMMITTEE::</span> Mr Lebona, sorry I don't understand this piece of evidence.   Mr Lebona I'm trying to clarify each person.  The question posed to you is, why did you kill this Mr Nglamini, or let me phrase this question in this fashion for you to understand.   ...not my problem, what I don't understand is the evidence that thereafter he threw a stone at the woman, I don't understand what that means.   I don't understand what is meant by saying thereafter he threw a stone at her or at him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1605"><a name="pos1605"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Mr Lebona to clarify members of this Committee this act you are referring to of Zenzile with this woman and the stone, where did it happen and how did it happen, can</p>

<p class="line" id="line1607"><a name="pos1607"></a>93	P LEBONA</p>
<p class="line" id="line1608"><a name="pos1608"></a>you clarify on that?   You are talking about a stone, the Committee wants to understand where does that come from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1609"><a name="pos1609"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> This incident took place at Mrs (indistinct), that was on 20 July.   Zenzile with his gangster went into this woman's house and they demanded money, cash, and this woman said to them I don't have money and they took her husband and they fastened him and they raped the woman and after raping her, Zenzile took a very big stone and he crushed this woman on the head with this stone and this woman was lying down and he left with his gangster.  We only came to know about this matter on the 21st.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1610"><a name="pos1610"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> ...he decided to crush this woman you are talking about with a stone, do you know the reasons thereof?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1611"><a name="pos1611"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes I know the reasons, this woman was the member of the ANC Women's League, he knew, he knew here very well, and Zenzile was really intending to kill the activists of the ANC that is why he chose to do that act.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1612"><a name="pos1612"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Are there any other acts that you can enlighten the Committee about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1613"><a name="pos1613"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> There are acts sir, but they happened before.   There are three women who went to Zenzile during the time of his comradeship, that is before he was revealed as a member of this gangster.   These women wanted him to give them this things, and Zenzile took these three women and they slept with them the whole night.   The next morning the three women came back to the comrades to report what happened to them.   The comrades said to them go to the police station because this is a criminal act you have to open a charge.   When these women went to the police station it so happened that Zenzile was not arrested at all.   Comrade Bosakwe and other comrades took Zenzile personally to the police station</p>

<p class="line" id="line1615"><a name="pos1615"></a>94	P LEBONA</p>
<p class="line" id="line1616"><a name="pos1616"></a>for this act of raping three women.   He was supposed to take the names of other friends who were with him when they raped these three women.   On the same night of raping the three women he was present in the township and this indicated to us that there was a connection between this group and the policemen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1617"><a name="pos1617"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> You talked of the mass meeting that called Zenzile, what meeting was that, who called that meeting, who attended that meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1618"><a name="pos1618"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> It was not on the same day where he raped the three women, it was a day on which he crushed Mrs Matelo's head with a stone and we were discussing the crime that was present in our township and on that same day while we were still at the mass meeting, that problem arrived and we sent marshals to fetch Zenzile.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1619"><a name="pos1619"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Kindly listen to the question that is posed and answer the question as it is asked please.   I'm referring to 21 July, you talked of a mass meeting.   The question is who called that mass meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1620"><a name="pos1620"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> On the 21st the mass meeting was called by the executive committee members of the ANC Youth League, that was comrade Papi, he was one of them, and Bosakwe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1621"><a name="pos1621"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Who attended that mass meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1622"><a name="pos1622"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> All the comrades were present and the members of the community, they were all present at the mass meeting.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1632"><a name="pos1632"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> ...the purpose of you calling Zenzile into the meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1633"><a name="pos1633"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> The reason was that we'd been discussing this crime and Zenzile was implicated because he went to Mrs (indistinct) house to demand money and he raped her and then he crushed her with a stone.   An instruction was taken out that he should come before the meeting to give reasons as to why he did those acts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1634"><a name="pos1634"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> ...to the meeting and then what happened? (Microphone not working for initial part of questions).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1635"><a name="pos1635"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> He was brought to the meeting and after explaining, after confessing that he personally did that, he asked for forgiveness as to, he told us that he was drunk he didn't know what he was doing and he was asked why did he target the ANC Women's League and there was then a decision that Zenzile should be taken to the police station by the comrades, he shouldn't go to the police station on his own.  The woman was already in the hospital and I was among the members who were taking Zenzile to the police station.   As we were walking along with him...</p>

<p class="line" id="line1641"><a name="pos1641"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> When you took Zenzile to the meeting were you aware that he was armed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1642"><a name="pos1642"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> We knew that he had a gun but on that day we didn't realise that he had a gun on himself because we didn't search him, we didn't want the conditions or the situation to be bad, we just talked to him in a very polite manner and he was walking to the meeting together with us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1643"><a name="pos1643"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Was he aware at the time that you were armed?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1841"><a name="pos1841"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> See the other man, Bosakwe, Elias Bosakwe, his statement starts with exactly the same wording "Post February 1990 era marked a significant hallmark in the history of our democratic revolution".   So you now say quite by chance three of you picked on the same sentence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1842"><a name="pos1842"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> What we said was prevailing then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1843"><a name="pos1843"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Yes, and paragraph by paragraph is the same.   I think your advocate will agree that the three statements are identical?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1849"><a name="pos1849"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> You can give no explanation for that, you ask us to believe that by some coincidence beyond all belief the three of you asked someone to write for you identical statements, four pages long each, can you give any explanation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1850"><a name="pos1850"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I think what is written in that statement is exactly what was said by each one of us, those are the activities that were taking place in the township.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1858"><a name="pos1858"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> Yes that could quite easily happen, they were given yours and copied yours, that I'm quite prepared to accept.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1895"><a name="pos1895"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> Forgot that you shot him because he had a gun?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1901"><a name="pos1901"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> There is nothing in your statement indicating that Zenzile was taken away from the mass meeting to the police station.

<p class="line" id="line1906"><a name="pos1906"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> There was an order to take the deceased to the police station but they masses were behind us and they said the police have failed and they wanted to have clear clarity as to whether we were taking the deceased to the police station, but after I shot at him they stoned him.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1912"><a name="pos1912"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Yes they were following us from the mass meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1913"><a name="pos1913"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> In your statement originally when you applied for amnesty, the statement you put up was that the killing took place at the mass meeting because the crowd wouldn't let you take him away.</p>

Can you give any idea of when that was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1918"><a name="pos1918"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> I forget the date and the day because it's a long time ago but it was in 1990 when this took place, it was in 1990.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1919"><a name="pos1919"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> Can you tell us when the other crime was committed when he poured paraffin over Mdevu and burned him?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1927"><a name="pos1927"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> He wasn't alone but the others were not known.  He was notorious because he was first a member of the ANC and he crossed the floor and he became the leader of this Kofifi group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1928"><a name="pos1928"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> The other incident when the other woman was raped, was he the only one present or were there other people present too?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1929"><a name="pos1929"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> There were people who raped with him but we couldn't get hold of them, they only appeared in the court of law when they were supposed to appear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1930"><a name="pos1930"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER::</span> So they were arrested and in fact appeared in court for the rape?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1962"><a name="pos1962"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> To be honest I was disturbed about this issue I don't know about the other comrades but the order was to take him to the police station.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1968"><a name="pos1968"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> We got information that he was also a member of this vigilant(?) group but we didn't have full evidence because every time when these terrible acts took place his name would not appear among the members who were there.</p>

I just want to make this observation, not only as a benefit to yourself but to other aspirant applicants and most probably your co-applicants.   You see my brother asked you a question about the identical statements made by yourself and your co-applicants.   It actually went further than that, the contents of the application forms like paragraph 11(b) for example, are actually identical.   In fact it turns out that if the dates on which they are signed are anything to go by, it turns out that they made their statements before you made your statement, so there can't be any question of them having copied from your statement.   If the dates are anything to go by and if they are identical, the probabilities are that you copied from their statements.  Are you sure that you did not take from their statements, the contents of their application forms like paragraph 11(b)?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1988"><a name="pos1988"></a><span class="speaker">ATTORNEY::</span> Chairperson I will prefer to consult further on this aspect.   I did consult on it but I will prefer to consult further on it.   The clarification I am seeking from this Committee is whether the possibility of the Committee accepting supplementary affidavits to the ones that, to the statements that are before the Committee, whether those will be acceptable to, that was another option that one was entertaining.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1993"><a name="pos1993"></a>the statement presented before the Committee allegedly to be from the applicant.   Chairperson my instructions are as follows - when the applications were being made they were made in prison.  All the applicants were in one cell and as they were in one cell, with the advices from the prominent figures from the ANC, and in particular they name mentioned here is the one of Mr Oupa (indistinct) who is the member of parliament for the ANC National Assembly.   Following those advices then they assisted each other.   Now in assisting each other then they charged Mr Dlanjwa.  Dlanjwa, Chairperson is one of the applicants in the matter that will follow.   The reason why he himself in particular was charged of assisting I am told it was because of his educational background.  When he was arrested and convicted Chairperson, Mr Dlanjwa was a third year law student.   I talked to him in this regard and he advised me as well that he did so, however whatever that he put down in writing is what was dictated upon by the applicant and the two other co-applicant in this matter.   </p>
<p class="line" id="line1994"><a name="pos1994"></a>	Chairperson this problem is similar to what we may experience in the coming matter.   The statements were as well written by the same Dlanjwa.   Chairperson my moving away from, these were my instructions, however when I raised an appeal the fact that it be taken, I appeal that it be taken by this Committee to cognisance that the forms were filled in prison, the applicants had no legal assistance.  They may not have understood the questions on their own and hence sought assistance of their major (indistinct).  Thank you Mr Chairperson.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1999"><a name="pos1999"></a>asked him questions this morning said that they were in different prisons, they didn't consult together.   Am I now to accept that he was lying the whole time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2000"><a name="pos2000"></a><span class="speaker">ATTORNEY::</span> Chairperson the truth of the matter is about the applicant before the Committee now, I know when I had to consult with him in prison as well I had a problem, it's true that he was in the prison called "Rooigrond" in Mmabatho, when others were kept here in Potchefstroom prison, so what he was telling the Committee that he was not with others may be true in that sense.   However, I am unable to explain further whether at that time of the dictation of these statements he was still in Rooigrond or he was with others and then he was moved to Rooigrond.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2001"><a name="pos2001"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON::</span> So they were all together when this was dictated, there is no doubt about that.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2009"><a name="pos2009"></a>	Chairperson before I commence may I seek your assistance in this regard?   In the light of the fact that it has become conclusive now, clear that the statements put before the Committee are of identical nature and from one source, I wondered whether will it still be preferred that the applicant as he sits there should repeat or should he cast clarity on what already has been said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2010"><a name="pos2010"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> I do not think any purpose will be served in a repetition of what we have heard but I think he is required to talk about his participation that has resulted in his application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2011"><a name="pos2011"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Thank you Chairperson.   Mr Lekitlana you were sitting here when your co-applicant was giving his evidence.  I am not going to make you repeat what he already said but we now know that you are asking amnesty from this Committee because of the murder that was committed in Kanana on 21 July 1991.   The interest of the Committee as you heard the Chairperson, is your role in that regard.   You killed or you played part in the killing of Mr Ndlameni, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2012"><a name="pos2012"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2013"><a name="pos2013"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION::</span> Can you now briefly or can you now extensively explain the role that you played here.   The role I mean what did you as Mr Lekitlana do on that day to the body of the deceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2014"><a name="pos2014"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> What I did to the corpse when he was shot, I open a knife and I stabbed him so that the victim should die.   After he died I poured petrol on him, when I was supposed to light him Elias Busakwe he told me that he has died already so we should not burn him.</p>

What prompted you to do that, why did you do that, what motivated you to do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2024"><a name="pos2024"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> Because I was among those who said he must be killed and what he did I didn't like.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2053"><a name="pos2053"></a><span class="speaker">ANSWER::</span> What I have seen which he did with my own eyes is when he entered a certain house, I was with him on that day when he did that terrible action, that woman who came and make an allegation that her husband is giving her trouble then he said to the father of that house to say, he told that husband to say he must never come into that house again, if he come I'm going to kill you.   When I came I found out that this is the house for the deceased, he is the father in this house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2054"><a name="pos2054"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN::</span> What do you understand by that?   Maybe because of language difficulties I didn't understand what the witness is trying to say.   Is it possible for you to clear up what he is trying to say?</p>

<p class="line" id="line2161"><a name="pos2161"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Mr Lekitlana, I just want to clear something.  When you started your evidence, when you were being led by your counsel, you were asked a question as to why you killed Zenzile, and in your response you said you killed him because you were amongst those who said he must be killed, because you did not like what he did.  I want to know when was the decision to kill Zenzile taken by yourself as you have earlier stated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2162"><a name="pos2162"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKITLANA:</span> The decision was taken at the time when we were ordered to take him to the police station.  As we were on our way the co-accused shot at him because he wanted to</p>

<p class="line" id="line2166"><a name="pos2166"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Was there any discussion between you and Mr Lebona to kill the deceased on your way or en route to the police station?</p>

<p class="line" id="line2168"><a name="pos2168"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> So when exactly did you take a decision to kill him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2169"><a name="pos2169"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKITLANA:</span> The decision was taken at the time when the deceased pulled out his gun and the co-accused saw him and he shot at him and as he shot I was also there and I wanted to stop him from shooting the community with his gun.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2170"><a name="pos2170"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Can we have some order.  You stabbed the deceased after he had been shot by Mr Lebona, is that not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2171"><a name="pos2171"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKITLANA:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2172"><a name="pos2172"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Why did you stab him after he had been shot?  What threat was he at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2173"><a name="pos2173"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKITLANA:</span> He was a threat because he was still on his feet.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2176"><a name="pos2176"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> The group that Zenzile was a member of.  Was he a member of any gang?  Was Zenzile, the deceased, a member of any gang?</p>

<p class="line" id="line2191"><a name="pos2191"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKITLANA:</span> I didn't know that Zenzile was colluding with the police.  Because most of the time there was a certain woman who was a CID and I forget her name, he was always in the company of this woman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2192"><a name="pos2192"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Was that not because he liked women?</p>

<p class="line" id="line2222"><a name="pos2222"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Mr Busakwe, we know from the application that  you were a member of the ANC and an additional member of the branch Executive Committee and a Chief Marshall of the ANC.  The issue is the murder that was committed on 21st July 1991.  Can you tell us or this Committee what your actual role was, what did you personally do to the body of the deceased on that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2223"><a name="pos2223"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUSAKWE:</span> I did nothing to the body.  I did nothing to his body.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2224"><a name="pos2224"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Where were you when the deceased was killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2225"><a name="pos2225"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUSAKWE:</span> I was at the mass meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2226"><a name="pos2226"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Can you explain the circumstances from the mass meeting level up to the death of the deceased, where were you, the role you played in all the circumstances?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2227"><a name="pos2227"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUSAKWE:</span> We were in a mass meeting on the 21st July 1991.  The mass meeting was jointly organised by the ANC and the Civic Association.  The main points that were to be discussed in the mass meeting was the crime that was taking high stands in the township.  I was one of the key speakers of the day.  During the proceeding of the meeting a report came in, that is the report as to what the deceased did to another woman who was a member of the ANC Women's League.  As a Chief Marshall I took out an order to the marshalls that were present at the mass meeting that they should rush to the place of the scene.  It is true they left and when they came back they came back with the deceased and they said he was the perpetrator.  Because we knew him as the</p>
<p class="line" id="line2228"><a name="pos2228"></a>4	leader/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line2229"><a name="pos2229"></a>132	MR BUSAKWE</p>
<p class="line" id="line2230"><a name="pos2230"></a>leader of the gangsters called Kofifi.  They brought him back.  When he arrived at the mass meeting we wanted to know from the comrades who brought him back as to what happened actually and they requested the deceased to tell the story himself and he explained what happened on that day with that woman.  After his explanation, because I was in the leadership, we took a decision that the deceased should be taken to the police station.  Many people in the mass meeting, after listening to his story, there was now a division among the people present at the meeting, especially the women.   That is where we saw angry women, demanding that he should be killed.  We pleaded as the leadership that the police should be given the last chance with regard to this deceased.  It was a continuous strike and the position was that he should be taken direct to the police station.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2231"><a name="pos2231"></a>There were marshalls elected to escort the deceased to the police station.  About five minutes after they have left we heard a gunshot and when we heard this gunshot people dispersed and many of them ran towards the direction of the gunshot.  We ran towards that direction also and when we arrived we found the deceased lying on the ground.  He was being stoned, he was being stabbed with knives and when I arrived, together with Comrade Buda Diamond, we appealed to the people who were killing and assaulting this person.  We said, stop it, but unfortunately when we arrived he was already dead.  Because I, together with comrade, picked him up from the ground and when we tried to pick him up that is when  Richard Faunda arrived and he had an iron bar in his hand and he hit him on the head and that was the end of the deceased.  We put him on the floor and another woman came with a rag and a blanket and we put it over to the deceased.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2234"><a name="pos2234"></a>After doing that, one of the accused, Mr Solomon Lekitlana, came with petrol and he poured the deceased with petrol and I rushed to him and I stopped him not to carry on with that action because the person was already dead.    (NOISE)</p>

<p class="line" id="line2236"><a name="pos2236"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Mr Busakwe, is it correct that the deceased was killed because of what he had done with the woman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2237"><a name="pos2237"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUSAKWE:</span> According to my speculation and their knowledge, it wasn't the only reason for him to be killed.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2239"><a name="pos2239"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUSAKWE:</span> Since 1990 we had problems in Kanana.  People were collecting money using the organisation's name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2240"><a name="pos2240"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> When you say "people were collecting money", I want you to be more specific.  We are talking about the deceased.  Why was the deceased killed?  Now you must tell us why.  What were the things that the deceased did?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2241"><a name="pos2241"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUSAKWE:</span> The other thing that I know that was committed by the deceased, three women were raped and a report was brought to the comrades the next day and I was present when the report came in.  The three women were told to go and report the matter to the police station as it was a criminal case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2242"><a name="pos2242"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> How many women were there, these women who reported?</p>

<p class="line" id="line2245"><a name="pos2245"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUSAKWE:</span> According to my knowledge they were new in Kanana.  They were still looking for a place to stay.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2249"><a name="pos2249"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUSAKWE:</span> One other thing that I know, there was a comrade who was working in Vaalridge(?), Comrade Madewu.  He was attacked by the gangster and they demanded money.  They said the organisation wanted money.  According to the knowledge that Comrade Madewu was member of the leadership in Kanana ... he didn't give them money and they poured paraffin and they set him alight.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2250"><a name="pos2250"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> .... you will agree that the deceased was killed because of his criminal activities, is that correct?</p>

<p class="line" id="line2252"><a name="pos2252"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> You further agree with me that the deceased's activities, together with his gangsters Kofifi, had absolutely nothing to do with politics?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2253"><a name="pos2253"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUSAKWE:</span> I would not agree, because of the attacks from their side were directed to the members of the organisation.  Every time when we had mass meetings or rallies in the Kanana Township there would be threats from this gangsters that belonged to the deceased.  At times they would come and disrupt our meetings.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2258"><a name="pos2258"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> I am not asking you what you were accused of, I am asking was there evidence about what you were supposed to have done?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2259"><a name="pos2259"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUSAKWE:</span> The evidence that was brought forward was that I lifted the deceased as he was being assaulted.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2265"><a name="pos2265"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUSAKWE:</span> My problem for not giving my evidence, from the first day when I was arrested I lost hope in the system.  The prosecutor told me that you are going to be sentenced whether you like it or not and that is when I lost hope in the court of law.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2266"><a name="pos2266"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> So even though you were perfectly innocent you did not give evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2267"><a name="pos2267"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUSAKWE:</span> I tried to show that I was innocent, but nothing helped.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2268"><a name="pos2268"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> ... tried to show.  I said did you not give evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2269"><a name="pos2269"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUSAKWE:</span> Explain your question further on, Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2270"><a name="pos2270"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> From what you have told us you went there to lift this man after he had been attacked.  You prevented somebody from putting paraffin on this person for him to be burnt.  You did all that, yet you were charged with murder and you don't go and tell the Court that you did nothing else but to try and help the deceased.  Why didn't you do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2271"><a name="pos2271"></a><span class="speaker">MR BUSAKWE:</span> I think I explained that to the Court.</p>

The mother with the first case to Mayeko, is available, she is seated herein, and the father to Zenzile Dlamini, I was told by the policeman that he is going to be fetched now.  I would propose that we adjourn until tomorrow morning at nine o'clock for me to lead both of them in order to round up the two sets of applications.</p>

However, Mr Chairperson, having thought that we may proceed with the next  matter I wanted to raise certain concerns or issues.  The Chairperson asked me to get the maximum information relating to the co-accused in the matter of Popani and others, and I am still trying to get hold of the information.  I phoned the national headquarters of the ANC to provide with such an information.  The response I got was that the Justice Department was phoned about the matter and they were asked to dispatch a letter before such information could be released.  The ANC has done so.  They are still awaiting that information to be faxed through.  My request was should that information be available in the earliest it should be faxed at the fax number that I provided of this office.  Further to that, the concern was raised by the applicant in this matter who informed me that they show their concern about what happened and they took certain steps in an attempt to rectify the situation or to get clarity more.  I am told that a</p>

<p class="line" id="line2305"><a name="pos2305"></a>memorandum in the form of a petition was directed to the Supreme Court TPD.  The response that came concerning the same matter was that they were referred to a certain Captain Schoombee who apparently was dealing with the indemnities.  The response is still being awaited from the Captain Schoombee.  What I was trying to put before this Committee is, there is a concern from the applicant about the same matter as well. </p>

<p class="line" id="line2336"><a name="pos2336"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOMANDLA:</span> He was afraid of the comrades.  They were calling themselves Com-Tsotsis.  Therefore because he doesn't have an elder brother so he left to stay with his friends where he was staying.  When I left, I left because they said they were going to burn my house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2337"><a name="pos2337"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Was David any member of a political party?</p>

Then he said he wants to stay with his friends for three days, then on the third day I took him so that he must go to school in Transkei.

I asked the person who was working there, that person told me that seven bullets - then he said the only one which has killed him is one on the head, and even if he would be alive, he couldn't have been well mentally.</p>

Then he said don't hide him because I want to see him.  But he just said to me I just want to see him.  Then I told him that I don't want to go to location because if they don't find David they are going to kill me.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2385"><a name="pos2385"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOMANDLA:</span> I didn't believe that this Faltein was the one who killed my son, but I think he was trying to make me hurt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2386"><a name="pos2386"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> This Faltein and Ncube, they came before this Committee to ask for amnesty in terms of what they have done.  What is your feeling in terms of their request for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2387"><a name="pos2387"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOMANDLA:</span> I don't know how can I forgive them.  They've taken my son who was going to work for me when I am old.  They are going to work for their parents.  Even if I forgive them, but I am not going to forget.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2391"><a name="pos2391"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOMANDLA:</span> It is me who should forgive them because there is no one who is going to forgive them because they have killed my son.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2412"><a name="pos2412"></a><span class="speaker">MISS NOMANDLE:</span> I want to put a tombstone for my son.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2416"><a name="pos2416"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2417"><a name="pos2417"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> I heard your answering the question which was asked about forgiveness.  You said there is no other person who is able to forgive the applicants without you, other than you.  It has been explained by my learned that the applicants, one of them is Voltuin, another one is Ncube, they have asked for amnesty to the Amnesty Committee which is in front of us here.  The question is if these two people may take other steps in a different way that they may ask forgiveness from you as the parent of the deceased, will you forgive them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2418"><a name="pos2418"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOMANDLE:</span> Yes I will forgive them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2419"><a name="pos2419"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS</p>

<p class="line" id="line2422"><a name="pos2422"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Miss Nomandle you have stated one of the things that David said was the reason for them hating him was because he was not struggling with the comrades and that he</p>

<p class="line" id="line2424"><a name="pos2424"></a>144</p>
<p class="line" id="line2425"><a name="pos2425"></a>was wearing expensive clothes.  Where did he get the money to buy expensive clothes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2426"><a name="pos2426"></a><span class="speaker">MISS NOMANDLE:</span> I was working at a shop which was selling clothes, therefore I was buying for him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2427"><a name="pos2427"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> And where is Mbulelo's school, is it in Putong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2428"><a name="pos2428"></a><span class="speaker">MISS NOMANDLE:</span> When did you and David last stay together as a family?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2429"><a name="pos2429"></a><span class="speaker">MISS NOMANDLE:</span> We separated in November 1990 when they were now looking for him seriously.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2430"><a name="pos2430"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> So you started fearing for his life to an extent of leaving home from November 1990?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2431"><a name="pos2431"></a><span class="speaker">MISS NOMANDLE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2432"><a name="pos2432"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2433"><a name="pos2433"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> I don't know perhaps you can tell me, have you got the address of the school he was at in 1990?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2434"><a name="pos2434"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> No Mr Chairman but that can be ascertained from the witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2435"><a name="pos2435"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> You can give us the address of the school can you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2436"><a name="pos2436"></a><span class="speaker">MISS NOMANDLE:</span> I don't have the address, I don't have my papers here with me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2437"><a name="pos2437"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> No, if you tell us the name it will be in the telephone book won't it.  I am told we can find it.  And how was he doing at school?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2438"><a name="pos2438"></a><span class="speaker">MISS NOMANDLE:</span> He was doing very well from primary when I was taking him there.  They told me that he had difficulties with Sotho, then I talked with his mistress.  That other things which are taught in the medium of Sotho he doesn't understand them, therefore he failed them, then he said I should take him to the Xhosa school, then he said he will be okay, then he passed the same year in a new school, when he</p>

<p class="line" id="line2440"><a name="pos2440"></a>145</p>
<p class="line" id="line2441"><a name="pos2441"></a>was killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2442"><a name="pos2442"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> And we have heard about a place 658, do you know that place, house no.658?  Sorry I've given the wrong number, 856, yes sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2443"><a name="pos2443"></a><span class="speaker">MISS NOMANDLE:</span> 856, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2444"><a name="pos2444"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Is that near where he was staying or near where your grandmother is?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2445"><a name="pos2445"></a><span class="speaker">MISS NOMANDLE:</span> 856 is where my grandmother was staying, but David was never killed near there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2446"><a name="pos2446"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Where was he killed near, do you know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2447"><a name="pos2447"></a><span class="speaker">MISS NOMANDLE:</span> I don't know the number but I know that it was the house of Mr Ghale.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2448"><a name="pos2448"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> 685 was the number of the house we were given.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2449"><a name="pos2449"></a><span class="speaker">MISS NOMANDLE:</span> I think that is the correct one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2450"><a name="pos2450"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> With whom did he stay when you were no longer staying with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2451"><a name="pos2451"></a><span class="speaker">MISS NOMANDLE:</span> He was staying where his aunt was staying.  He was staying with his aunt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2452"><a name="pos2452"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Well to put a question in perspective, a question which was asked to you earlier on about the clothing, you see evidence was given before us here, for what it was worth, that David put on very expensive clothing to an extent that they were suspicious that he probably was getting some money from the police.  Now I know you have said that you bought him clothes he remained neat and the like, but would you say that you were in fact buying him what would appear to be expensive clothing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2453"><a name="pos2453"></a><span class="speaker">MISS NOMANDLE:</span> I was working at the Indian shops and then the Indian shops' clothes are not quite expensive.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2454"><a name="pos2454"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> He was dressed like an average child, not</p>
<p class="line" id="line2455"><a name="pos2455"></a>5A.	extraordinary/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line2456"><a name="pos2456"></a>145</p>
<p class="line" id="line2457"><a name="pos2457"></a>extraordinary, am I right or wrong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2458"><a name="pos2458"></a><span class="speaker">MISS NOMANDLE:</span> He was dressing like any other child.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2459"><a name="pos2459"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Now you have mentioned what I thought you were wanting to say AZASM, am I close enough to what you wanted to say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2460"><a name="pos2460"></a><span class="speaker">MISS NOMANDLE:</span> David was belonging to the AZASM group and he was fighting with the Com Tsotsis, so I didn't understand those things because I didn't even want to know them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2461"><a name="pos2461"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Now to the best of my knowledge AZASM stood for Azanian Student Movement, now was he active in student movements?  Was he an active member of any student movement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2462"><a name="pos2462"></a><span class="speaker">MISS NOMANDLE:</span> When I was staying with him, even when I was not staying with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2463"><a name="pos2463"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Whether during the time you stayed with her, with him or during the time that you did not stay with him were you aware?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2464"><a name="pos2464"></a><span class="speaker">MISS NOMANDLE:</span> At that time when he was staying with me I didn't hear about him talking about any participation in any student movement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2465"><a name="pos2465"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> And the time you were not staying with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2466"><a name="pos2466"></a><span class="speaker">MISS NOMANDLE:</span> Is then that I started to hear about AZASM.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2467"><a name="pos2467"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> From whom did you hear about this AZASM, from him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2468"><a name="pos2468"></a><span class="speaker">MISS NOMANDLE:</span> I had people talking about those things when there was a fight between the two parties.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2469"><a name="pos2469"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Well I thought you said they called each or they would call each other AZASM?  I thought you were also referring to the deceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2470"><a name="pos2470"></a><span class="speaker">MISS NOMANDLE:</span> It was that group which were telling me that they were fighting with the Com Tsotsis, the AZASM were telling me that they were fighting with the Com Tsotsis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2471"><a name="pos2471"></a>5A.	JUDGE NGOEPE:/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line2472"><a name="pos2472"></a>146</p>
<p class="line" id="line2473"><a name="pos2473"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Well did the deceased fall into any of the groups either AZASM or Com Tsotsis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2474"><a name="pos2474"></a><span class="speaker">MISS NOMANDLE:</span> I didn't know which group he was falling either AZASM or Com Tsotsis, I was surprised, I thought even it's PAC because I got the T-shirt there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2475"><a name="pos2475"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> I don't understand under what circumstances anybody could have told you about the conflict between AZASM and the Com Tsotsis, if this was not told to you by your son.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2476"><a name="pos2476"></a><span class="speaker">MISS NOMANDLE:</span> I was not told by my son I was just hearing about, from people because I was staying - in town there were people were telling me that AZASM were fighting with the Com Tsotsis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2477"><a name="pos2477"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> By the way what made you become scared of staying at your - at home?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2478"><a name="pos2478"></a><span class="speaker">MISS NOMANDLE:</span> What made me to flee my home is that they came home and then my neighbour told me again that they came.  When I are forced to sleep in my house and then people were dancing and singing and then the following day I packed my things and then I left the furniture there. But they didn't burn.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2479"><a name="pos2479"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Why would they do that to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2480"><a name="pos2480"></a><span class="speaker">MISS NOMANDLE:</span> That time the way they were fighting it seems if they don't get somebody they meet(?) they would kill the mother or any other person in the family, any other person in the family was had.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2481"><a name="pos2481"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Did you get the impression that they were after your son?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2482"><a name="pos2482"></a><span class="speaker">MISS NOMANDLE:</span> Yes the impression was created that that day when I came to visit him he said I think you should not stay, if they come and find me here they are going to kill</p>
<p class="line" id="line2483"><a name="pos2483"></a>5A.	you/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line2484"><a name="pos2484"></a>147</p>

<p class="line" id="line2486"><a name="pos2486"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Did he tell you why they wanted to kill, why they were after him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2487"><a name="pos2487"></a><span class="speaker">MISS NOMANDLE:</span> He didn't tell me but he just said they are fighting each other.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2488"><a name="pos2488"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Did you not want to find out from him as your son and say well just tell me what is this problem about, it must be a huge problem so much so that you wanted to leave your house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2489"><a name="pos2489"></a><span class="speaker">MISS NOMANDLE:</span> I did ask him that, why did they fight me but he just said they are fighting each other.  If they are going to make some mass action he didn't participate in that activities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2490"><a name="pos2490"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Now you say after his death you found a T-shirt with the PAC letters or emblem.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2491"><a name="pos2491"></a><span class="speaker">MISS NOMANDLE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2492"><a name="pos2492"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Were you seeing that for the first time after his death?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2493"><a name="pos2493"></a><span class="speaker">MISS NOMANDLE:</span> Yes I was seeing it for the first time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2494"><a name="pos2494"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> You wouldn't know who bought it for him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2495"><a name="pos2495"></a><span class="speaker">MISS NOMANDLE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2496"><a name="pos2496"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> I wanted to ask you whether you know Mr Nlavane or Mr Mche(?) can you help me, who were the two people who were with the deceased, allegedly, who were allegedly in the company of the deceased except Scarface?</p>

But the first to testify will be Gcinisizwe who is number two, followed by Umkontwana who is number three, and lastly it will be Popane who is number one on the list.  Unfortunately Mr Chairman and members of the Committee the bundle is not paginated for me to refer the members of the Committee with ease where Gcinisizwe's application is, but it is somewhere towards the middle.  My apologies for such an omission.  Gcinisizwe's application is number 1289 in the bundle.  I will now then Mr Chairman hand over to my learned friend.</p>

The act that you are asking amnesty on is on the act of murder committed on the 31st October 1990, two, the act of attempted murder committed on the 31st of October 1990.  Both acts, in terms of the application were committed at Kuma location taxi rank near Stilfontein. Can you explain to the Committee, we see in your application the person murdered was Abednigo Nzimeni Mazwi and the one assaulted, the attempted murder was for Charles Mhlambiso.  Can you</p>

<p class="line" id="line2533"><a name="pos2533"></a>151</p>
<p class="line" id="line2534"><a name="pos2534"></a>explain to the committee the role you played when Abednigo was killed and when Charles Mhlambiso was nearly killed? </p>
<p class="line" id="line2535"><a name="pos2535"></a><span class="speaker">MR GCINISIZWE:</span> Yes I will, firstly since the 30th of October 1990, Charles Mhlambiso and Abednigo Mazwi and their other friends, they went into Mrs Mary Agnes Kunwana's house who was a member of the executive of the ANC, who was the chairperson of the Kuma Civic Association as well, who was the chairperson of the ANC branch, Women's League. We were staying at her house. Nzimeni and Mhlambiso went there and they threw an explosive device to the property.  There was a meeting before.  It was the ANC Youth Congress meeting, which is my branch.  In this meeting the discussion was regarding the things that Nzimeni and his group were doing in their struggle in the location.  There was a proposal tabled, been debated upon as the executive of the ANC Congress, that Nzimeni must be attacked.  Nzimeni and the group, they must be attacked. Whilst busy debating around that matter, a marshal arrived telling us that Nzimeni has just arrived with a Combi with his group in the Combi and they said they will be back again.  We went back to the meeting and then we decided not to proceed with the meeting and stay alert for anything that might happen.  The other comrades went away to go and collect other comrades as well. Nzimeni came back again with the Combi and he threw the explosive that I've just mentioned earlier on. We had a very extraordinary meeting thereafter. The meeting of the leadership of the Stilfontein branch the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2536"><a name="pos2536"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> You've said ANC before, do you mean ANC or do you mean ANC youth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2537"><a name="pos2537"></a><span class="speaker">MR GCINISIZWE:</span> I'm talking about the ANC, the African National Congress.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2540"><a name="pos2540"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> So this extraordinary meeting, was that of the Congress, that was the Youth Congress meeting was it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2541"><a name="pos2541"></a><span class="speaker">MR GCINISIZWE:</span> I will clarify. It was a joint sitting</p>
<p class="line" id="line2542"><a name="pos2542"></a>of the African Congress leadership, South African Youth Congress, which is SAYCO, the Stilfontein branch, African National Congress the Women's League, and the marshals that used to stay in Mary Agnes' house, all the occupants of Mary Agnes' house, they were all present. Yes I'll carry on. </p>
<p class="line" id="line2543"><a name="pos2543"></a>In that meeting we were discussing the issue of Nzimeni and the attack that he had already launched, that it was very clear that Nzimeni not prepared to reconcile with us and make peace with us.  He was not prepared to reconcile with us at all. There were two viewpoints in that extraordinary meeting. The first one was that Nzimeni must be attacked and the rest of the group must be put on the run.  And the next view point was that Nzimeni must be taken to the police. This view was advanced by myself an Patrick Mkontwana as members of the working committee which was established in accordance to the Groote Schuur minute to diffuse all possibilities of violence that might occur in the township, particularly due to the confrontation between the police and the ANC members. Then what happened afterwards, we agreed that we should take them to the police, we'll apprehend them and take them to the police because I did raise this issue in one of our meetings as a working group and Mr de Beer who was a policeman and was a member of the working group, apparently, said that they ran away from the location and therefore it's not easy to locate them. And we said that we'll take it upon ourselves to locate them and take them to the police.  The following day we were going to look for the taxi that was driving them around the previous day and we </p>
<p class="line" id="line2544"><a name="pos2544"></a>1A.	woke/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line2545"><a name="pos2545"></a>152</p>
<p class="line" id="line2546"><a name="pos2546"></a>woke up the following morning with other comrades and marshals, we went to the taxi rank to try and locate this taxi.  When we got to the taxi rank we found the taxi and the driver.  When we asked him as to where were the people that that you were transporting yesterday, at night, he said that he does not work at night, there is someone else who does the night duty, he only does the day duty.  We explained to him clearly our position to the taxi drivers who were there on the 31st of October 1990, we were explaining them clearly about our standpoint as the ANC Stilfontein Branch in the location, that we please plead with them to help us find Njima Nzimeni, should he hijack one of their taxis they must please go straight to the police station.  And whilst we were trying to explain this to these taxi drivers, Charles Mhlambiso was supported by the comrades that were accompanying me, he was near Nzimeni. Please bear in mind that Nzimeni's house is not so far from the taxi rank.  On arrival of the comrades at Nzimeni's house, as we were busy addressing the taxi drivers, the comrades they started beating up Charles Mhlambiso with pangas and knives because we were armed all the time. Then we rushed to the scene. When we got to the scene I started pulling Charles Mhlambiso from a ...(indistinct) and I explained to the comrades that our attitude and our standpoint in the meeting, I instructed two marshals to take Charles to the police on the 31st of October in the morning. Then we went into Nzimeni's house.  When we got inside I spoke to his mother and wanted to know where Nzimeni is.  She told me that he ran away. I enquired at the people in the street as to whether they did see him.  No, nobody knew.  Now I started to become scared because the </p>
<p class="line" id="line2547"><a name="pos2547"></a>1A.	comrades/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line2548"><a name="pos2548"></a>153</p>
<p class="line" id="line2549"><a name="pos2549"></a>comrades were very angry.  They were angry because we managed to stop them killing Charles because they'd already poured petrol on him and they were about to set him alight looking for matches when I stopped them.  The comrades were very angry. And that is not a surprise because in our meeting there were mixed feelings as to whether we must kill them or what exactly must we do with them. I went to Mrs Botman who is the front opposite with Mrs Mazwi which is Nzimeni's mother. When I got to Mrs Botman who is a member of the ANC Youth League and she used to help us with food, I did explain to her my concern and my fear that the comrades can do something that I am not sure as to what it is.  As I was still discussing this with Mrs Botman we heard noise and then when we rushed out we found comrades, they were beating up Nzimeni. They hit him with pangas and knives, with everything they came across. I just stood there, I never went there to try and interfere. As the leader of the comrades, as the leader of SAYCO, as a member of the executive of the ANC and as a member of the working group as well, I never tried to stop the comrades to do this and in that respect I'm guilty. I'm not immune from any sense of guilty. I feel more guilty than the active participants in the actual deed because if I did use my powers as a leader, this would not have happened.  If I did go try and stop them and reminded them about our standpoint in the meeting, this would have never happened. In that respect I'm very sorry.  I'm sorry to God my creator, I'm sorry to Mrs Mazwi, the mother, I'm sorry to Mrs Mazwi, the wife, I'm sorry to the rest of the bereaved family.  I failed Nzimeni, I accept and I admit in front of this Committee, that I did fail Nzimeni. And after that Nzimeni </p>

<p class="line" id="line2551"><a name="pos2551"></a>154</p>
<p class="line" id="line2552"><a name="pos2552"></a>lay down next to the taxi rank because they were driving him all the way along.  On arrival I advised the comrades to go back to Mrs Agnes' house. When we got to Mary Agnes' house I advised the comrades further who were present at that </p>
<p class="line" id="line2553"><a name="pos2553"></a>moment, who participated in the murder of Nzimeni, that they should leave.  They should run away because the police will be coming after us and we knew that they will be coming at Mary Agnes' house to arrest us. And once again I'm sorry to Mrs Mazwi that the people who victimised her child, I personally advised them to run away, but I'm not sorry to the criminal system about the thing that I did. I'll stop there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2554"><a name="pos2554"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Mr Gcinisizwe, we understand that at the time you were in the leadership of the South African Youth Congress, you mentioned you participated in the working group that was set in terms of the Groote Schuur Minute and you were also in the executive of the ANC.  You at the time of the assault, I'm taking you to the time of the assault of Charles Mhlambiso, you said people, the comrades that you were with, started hitting him with pangas and they almost killed him by pouring petrol on him.  Can you mention, who were those people, their names?  Who was hitting with panga, who was hitting with stone, who was the one who wanted to pour petrol and wanted to set him alight?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2555"><a name="pos2555"></a><span class="speaker">MR GCINISIZWE:</span> The comrades that I saw who participated at that time, you must understand that the whole scene was emotional, there was just a commotion because it was next to a taxi rank and it was the morning, people being on their way to work, the comrade that I saw was comrade Baby-Face, the first one and comrade Baring Letia too, comrade Shepherd Charlie and a few other comrades that I don't know their</p>

<p class="line" id="line2557"><a name="pos2557"></a>155</p>
<p class="line" id="line2558"><a name="pos2558"></a>names. I have just forgotten their names. About two or three of them that were there at that time, who were hitting him at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2559"><a name="pos2559"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> And now Nzimeni, who hit Nzimeni with pangas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2560"><a name="pos2560"></a><span class="speaker">MR GCINISIZWE:</span> The comrades participated in hitting Nzimeni, the comrades that I saw on my way out of Mrs Botman's house, some of them I just know their first names.  The first one, Frans Masike is the first one, comrade Albie Fasie(?), comrade Charlie, Shepherd Charlie, comrade Gomilivi, comrade Madala was there as well. I just know him as Madala, and just a few other comrades that I just cannot recall their names clearly. But I think in my motivation that I wrote, I did mention them, in my motivation. On the last page of my motivation, I did mention them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2561"><a name="pos2561"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Mr Gcinisizwe, and who was this Nzimeni, how did you know Nzimeni?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2562"><a name="pos2562"></a><span class="speaker">MR GCINISIZWE:</span> Firstly let me say Nzimeni's issue is quite confusing.  Firstly we knew him as a member of the organisation and then on the 23rd of August 1990, ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line2563"><a name="pos2563"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> I am sorry to interrupt there, when you say at first you knew him as a member of the organisation, which organisation, can you be specific?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2564"><a name="pos2564"></a><span class="speaker">MR GCINISIZWE:</span> I'm talking about the South African Youth Congress. On the 23rd of August 1990, we were to have a meeting.  Okay let me go a bit further back, before the 23rd of August there was a meeting organised somewhere in July, it was an organised mass meeting. That mass meeting, it was going to discuss about the invitation to the MDM coming from the policemen who were based at the location, there was a threat and a rumour around the location that the houses of</p>

<p class="line" id="line2566"><a name="pos2566"></a>155</p>
<p class="line" id="line2567"><a name="pos2567"></a>the police would be burned down because of the murder Hendrick Mkwanasi who was murdered by the police by two policemen and the house of one of the policemen was burned down. There was that threat that the policemens' houses would be burned down.  We had a meeting as MDM structures whether to accept the invitation or reject it after the invitation of the police.  Then we could not reach an agreement as to whether we should reject or accept that because of political implications of it.  Then we decided to take the matter to the mass meeting and indeed we did call the mass meeting to discuss the issue.  Whilst we were busy debating this issue in this mass meeting Nzimeni and his group arrived.  They had pangas and knives.  They had all the weapons you can think of that are dangerous except for guns, and they had car tyres around their necks which is a necklace symbol, in the past. They said we are selling them out as leadership and we are selling them out to our killers.  They threatened to attack us then and there. Nomazwe Chonemane, who used to work in the Lawyers for Human Rights who was there in the meeting as a resident of Kuma now she's a member of parliament in the North West Region, she tried to speak to Nzimeni and his group that the issue has not yet been finalised, we are still debating the issue and they must just be part and parcel of the deliberations of the meeting. And if ever you're reject it, just try and be available.  They did not want to take Nomazwe Jomela's advice.  We decided as leadership then and there that we must just recess.  That I knew him as a member of the South African Youth Congress is because he used to be present in our meetings and he was present in that meeting on that particular day but the manner and the approach that he used, 1A.	I/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line2568"><a name="pos2568"></a>156</p>
<p class="line" id="line2569"><a name="pos2569"></a>I started suspecting him personally that there was something that was just not proper with him. But my analysis about him was not conclusive as such.  Thereafter we went to Mary Agnes' house then we discussed a few things furthermore, because there was the issue of the rent in the location that we were still discussing. And on the 23rd of August 1990, we were going to discuss the issue of rent in the location.  We were going to have a mass meeting in the local stadium.  We were preparing for the mass meeting that was to be on the 26th of August 1990. On arrival at the meeting in the local creche, the meeting didn't materialise because of the absence of certain key figures that were going to be there in the preparation of this mass meeting or mass rally. On the 26th of August or just before that, on our way out to Mary Agnes to try and contact these leaders that were absent, we met Nzimeni and his group being armed with these pangas and kerries and knives, they were having food and tinned stuff and bread.  We met them between creche and shops just in the open, being the leadership in the location they stopped us to find out that we did get the permission to use the stadium.  Mary Agnes Kunwana did explain to them that the permission issue of the stadium will be sorted out and they told that it is wanted urgently. We wondered as to what is happening.  We enquired as to where they were going to.  They just told us that they were monitoring in the location.  Having passed the shops, the shops were still open, they were carrying food and firearms. We suspected that there was something that they might have done. We enquired in the shopowners as to what happened. They told us that there were people who claimed that they were comrades and took food forcefully from their shops.  Then we went </p>

<p class="line" id="line2571"><a name="pos2571"></a>157</p>
<p class="line" id="line2572"><a name="pos2572"></a>back to Mary Agnes' house.  Then we discussed informally that these people, they are not comrades, they cannot be called comrades and (Tape 1A ends....)</p>
<p class="line" id="line2573"><a name="pos2573"></a>......prepared for the meeting to be held on the 26th of August. I was assigned to go an get permission to use the stadium from the Chief Magistrate.  I was on very good terms with the Chief Magistrate of Klerksdorp.  In most cases we are not allowed to use stadiums in the location, particularly the police, they didn't like the idea, I don't know why. Then I came back with the permission to use the stadium.  It was on Friday when I came with the permission.  On the 26th of August, in the morning, my father woke me up to say that I've got a phone call from Mary Agnes. Mary Agnes told me to arrive at her house urgently.  Then I hurried there.  On my arrival I found certain ANC leaders in the location.  When I enquired if there was any problem they told me that Nzimeni came into Mary Agnes' house with a large group at about half past four in the morning, being heavily armed with pangas and they explained to Mary Agnes that no leader of MDM will be allowed to talk with the residents in the township. No leader's going to address that mass meeting on that day, and they demanded a sound speaker that we used to use in mass meetings and it belonged to Mary Agnes' sister who was staying in Johannesburg, for use in our meetings and they demanded that they will be back to collect them.  So we sat and waited.  They came, these people, with people that were being intimidated to join that group, to go to the stadium. That group just showed that they were heavily armed.  They went into Mary Agnes' street and I was terrified and quiet and one of them did ask me as to why am I so quiet. I just wanted to know as to what should I say.  1B.	He/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line2574"><a name="pos2574"></a>158</p>
<p class="line" id="line2575"><a name="pos2575"></a>He told me that he must use the speaker.  I told him that you've got the speaker, we'll give you the speaker.  I told him that Derek Kosi, who was a member of the ANC and who was in the leadership as well will transport it with his car.  They said no, there's too many soldiers out there. So therefore they carried the speaker to the stadium.  Most of the people who were there, you could actually see that they were intimidated.  They looked surprised and confused, they did not know what was happening. They saw that here's the leadership that we've chosen, but what is actually happening?  Some of us came back to us, they never actually reached the stadium.  Those who came back, they told us that they were being taken forcefully out of the house with knives and pangas. One of these cases we referred to the police station, that it should deal with those matters, we don't have the power to deal with those. Then we proceeded to the stadium and we sat down as the leadership to discuss some of these issues, particularly in relation as to what was happening at that time regarding Nzimeni's issue and his group.  We came to a conclusion that we must go to a main hall because there was a meeting of National Union for Mine Workers.  When we got there we explained the situation to the comrades of the mines.  The workers gave us 50 marshals and two leaders of National Union of Mine Workers and go to the stadium and try and find out as to what is happening and what's Nzimeni's problem, because you know him as a member of the Youth Congress.  When we got to the stadium with the marshals, two leaders of the National Union of Mine Workers, they got to the podium to try and talk to Nzimeni. Nzimeni made his point very clear that these things have got nothing to do with the mines, it's a location issue </p>

<p class="line" id="line2596"><a name="pos2596"></a>heavily armed and by that time we were not armed yet.  We had not started arming ourselves yet.  When the comrades reported at the National </p>
<p class="line" id="line2597"><a name="pos2597"></a>Union of the Mine Workers, they advised that the comrades of the location must find a taxi and that we must hunt for these people and we've got the taxis to do that.  And we found them then we beat them up, we find some of them, we beat them up on the 26th of August.  The one I remember very well is Carter and other two that we found on that day, the rest of the group, we never found them, they were already in hiding. On that same day, after having beaten them up we took them home. On that same day I got a call from my mother to say that you must never come home today, Nzimeni has just left with his group and are having all dangerous weapons and they say they want your head. You better stay just where you are. And I assured her that I'm safe because there's comrades in Agnes' house.  On Wednesday I was arrested for beating these people.  After a lengthy trial at the regional court which took a year, in the Klerksdorp Regional Court, we were acquitted on the basis of lack of evidence against accused.  It was myself, Siabonga Sebe, Walter Siharudzi and Albie Fasie.  All of us were in this case of beating these other group members.  On Monday the 27th, on the 27th of August it was on a Monday, we were still hunting for them.  We had strength and power and the comrades were coming into Agnes place and we were carrying pangas and knives as well, all these dangerous weapons because the situation was becoming clear that it was dangerous.  We heard from the local police station when we got there, we were told that Mr de Beer will be called because he was with us in the working 1B.	group/...</p>

When he came, Mr de Beer, there were two comrades from the Regional Office, Zakes Mulekane and Howard, he was the chairperson of the regional office ANC, and Howard Dao.  We cannot discuss this in front of the police, we must go to a meeting.  Then we went to Wurakanela High School on the 27th of August.  When we got there we sat down and discussed this matter trying to get their viewpoint as to why do they do this?  The things that they disclosed they were not clear, they said they don't believe that we must discuss to form a working group with the police because they are not, I'll explain this issue of KUYOK. KUYOK of 1986 which was burning and finding targets, burning police cars and bakeries, everything they would enter the location delivering, burning police houses and everything.  They said they were members of KUYOK and they don't believe into the things that we do to sit down discussing.  They don't like discussions at all.  We came...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line2600"><a name="pos2600"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> I believe you have outlayed the way Mazwi conducted himself and you said that the manner that, as a member of the ANC,  the manner he conducted himself made you suspicious of him. What is there that you suspected about him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2601"><a name="pos2601"></a><span class="speaker">MR GCINISIZWE:</span> You know when you are a member of an organisation, you've got a democratic right to participate in all meetings and all the discussions and their strategies.

<p class="line" id="line2609"><a name="pos2609"></a>answering the question asked it's 10.A where you were asked to state a political objective sought to be achieved. </p>
<p class="line" id="line2610"><a name="pos2610"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> ....because to some of us this question may be important, you asked the question and there was some misunderstanding I believe and the Chairman interrupted, that's not the question you asked the witness, you didn't ask the witness as to what made you suspicious of him, your question was, what is it that you suspected of him, that was actually the question and that question hasn't been answered.  What is it that you suspected of him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2611"><a name="pos2611"></a><span class="speaker">MR GCINISIZWE:</span> The main thing that I was suspecting about Mazwi was that he was not a groomed patriot, he's not a member of the ANC or the ANC Youth Congress as he was claiming, because of his deeds.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2612"><a name="pos2612"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Was there anything that you may have seen in him or what he did and you saw that made you suspicious that he could be doing what he did out of mandate from somewhere other than the ANC structures?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2613"><a name="pos2613"></a><span class="speaker">MR GCINISIZWE:</span> You see the way he was, his attitude when he was about to talk to us, that's one thing that made us very suspicious of him, then the language that he was using, that's some of the things that made us to be very suspicious of him.  But it was just suspicions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2614"><a name="pos2614"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> I know you said you suspected that he was not a groomed person and he probably was not a genuine member of the ANC as he claimed he was, what did you suspect he was?</p>

<p class="line" id="line2616"><a name="pos2616"></a>162</p>
<p class="line" id="line2617"><a name="pos2617"></a>I know you told us what you suspected he was not but I would like to know what you suspected him to have been?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2618"><a name="pos2618"></a><span class="speaker">MR GCINISIZWE:</span> I was suspecting that he was an informer, a spy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2619"><a name="pos2619"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> You are saying it is what he did that made you</p>
<p class="line" id="line2620"><a name="pos2620"></a>suspect him to be an informer, or is there anything in particular that you can name and mention to this Committee that you believed because of that he was genuinely suspected to be a spy? </p>
<p class="line" id="line2621"><a name="pos2621"></a><span class="speaker">MR GCINISIZWE:</span> I don't know where to start answering this question as to be in the manner that you want me to answer you.  But when a person starts behaving like that in the Organisation and within the ranks of the ANC Youth structure, somebody who tries to be against the leadership, somebody who behaves in the manner in which Nzimeni was behaving, you could just clearly see that there was a motive behind. He was a person that when you analyse him you could see that he was just acting on a mandate.  That was the thing that made us to have suspicions of him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2622"><a name="pos2622"></a><span class="speaker">ADV CHRIS DE JAGER:</span> Isn't the position that he wouldn't abide by the decisions of the ANC, maybe even he was jealous of your leadership and he wouldn't accept the ANC's discipline?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2623"><a name="pos2623"></a><span class="speaker">MR GCINISIZWE:</span> There was a revelation that was made by Charles Mhlambiso, the one who was on attempted murder, there was a revelation that he made to us when we had caught him. That revelation was tape-recorded by the comrades. That tape record, we took it to the ANC National Headquarters, that tape regarding the revelation of Charles Mhlambiso, about the fact him and Nzimeni were being used by a certain Mr de Kock and a Mr Pretorius. Charles Mhlambiswa told us</p>

<p class="line" id="line2626"><a name="pos2626"></a>this, whether he told us that because he was being intimidated and scared that we might beat him up but that was the revelation that he gave us.  One of their group members on the 30th of October, he jumped off at Kumbe and he made similar revelations that were made by Charlie and we took him to the police station instantly.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2631"><a name="pos2631"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> You have said, and I just want to make quite sure I understood you, the revelation was made by Charles Mhlambiso "when we had caught him", so it was you who caught him, is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2632"><a name="pos2632"></a><span class="speaker">MR GCINISIZWE:</span> No the comrades caught him and I found him at Mary Agnes. I found him at Mary Agnes being caught by the comrades.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2633"><a name="pos2633"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> That's not what you said a minute or so ago, you then said, "when we had caught him".  Where was this tape recording taken?</p>

<p class="line" id="line2639"><a name="pos2639"></a>164</p>

<p class="line" id="line2641"><a name="pos2641"></a><span class="speaker">MR GCINISIZWE:</span> He was assaulted on the 31st of October. On that day he was not assaulted. It was before the attempted murder when he gave that revelation, he was not assaulted on that particular day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2642"><a name="pos2642"></a><span class="speaker">MS SISI KHAMPEPE:</span> Why had your group caught him, why had you apprehended Mhlambiso?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2643"><a name="pos2643"></a><span class="speaker">MR GCINISIZWE:</span> It's because we were looking for them, we were looking for them desperately. We were fighting with</p>
<p class="line" id="line2644"><a name="pos2644"></a>their group. We were fighting with them, and the struggle as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2645"><a name="pos2645"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> What did you intend to do with him after you had caught him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2646"><a name="pos2646"></a><span class="speaker">MR GCINISIZWE:</span> As I've said, as I've already mentioned that I was a member of the working group and after having explained this and Patrick Nkondona in the meeting of the working group, Mr de Beer said that they couldn't find them, they have run away.  That's one of the reasons that made us to look for them desperately, to search for them, Charles and Nzimeni.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2647"><a name="pos2647"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> You haven't answered question did you catch him with the purpose of taking him to the police station?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2648"><a name="pos2648"></a><span class="speaker">MR GCINISIZWE:</span> Yes it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2649"><a name="pos2649"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Did you take him to the police station?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2650"><a name="pos2650"></a><span class="speaker">MR GCINISIZWE:</span> No we never took him to the police station. He asked us not to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2651"><a name="pos2651"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Well that's fairly probable isn't it, why did you listen to him? You caught him because you wanted to take him to the police station because you were fighting with his group, why didn't you?</p>

<p class="line" id="line2654"><a name="pos2654"></a><span class="speaker">MR GCINISIZWE:</span> The thing is we were satisfied by the information that he gave us and we had to take this information to the National Office of the ANC so that they should guide us as to what to do after these revelations by Charles. The issue of the police, we'd see to it afterwards, because he pleaded with us that should Nzimeni know that he was there, then he would be in trouble.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2655"><a name="pos2655"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Wasn't it likely he would go and tell the people he was working for, Mr de Kock and Mr Pretorius that you had captured him?</p>

<p class="line" id="line2657"><a name="pos2657"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Wasn't it likely if you released him that he would go to Mr de Kock and Mr Pretorius and tell them that your gang was after him, that you'd captured him, you'd forced him to tell you what he was doing.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2663"><a name="pos2663"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Yes you may proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2664"><a name="pos2664"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Thank you Chairperson.  Mr Gcinisizwe, we had the background and the events of the time and what happened to your involvement that is the role.  The question that I want to ask you now is, do you believe in your mind that what happened or transpired at the time was politically motivated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2665"><a name="pos2665"></a><span class="speaker">MR GCINISIZWE:</span> Yes I believe so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2666"><a name="pos2666"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Referring you to your application again, Chairperson, members of the Committee, it's in this</p>
<p class="line" id="line2667"><a name="pos2667"></a>1B.	application/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line2668"><a name="pos2668"></a>166</p>
<p class="line" id="line2669"><a name="pos2669"></a>application form, Section 10B.  You said the Court acknowledged the fact that the offence was politically motivated. The question that I want to pose to you is when you wrote this statement, are you, or did you rely on your memory of what happened at Court during trial or on some documentation you may like it to be produced for members of the Committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2670"><a name="pos2670"></a><span class="speaker">MR GCINISIZWE:</span> Both and documentation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2671"><a name="pos2671"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> The documentation I want to assume that what I have in my possession, it's a, I don't know if you are</p>
<p class="line" id="line2672"><a name="pos2672"></a>referring to  it, it's only an article of a newspaper. Are you referring to it?	</p>
<p class="line" id="line2673"><a name="pos2673"></a><span class="speaker">MR GCINISIZWE:</span> Yes I'm referring to the article of City Press 20th March, it was written by Dan Dhlamini, in the documentation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2674"><a name="pos2674"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> 20th of March of what year?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2675"><a name="pos2675"></a><span class="speaker">MR GCINISIZWE:</span> 1994.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2676"><a name="pos2676"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Chairperson, I believe members of the Committee were afforded this article.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2677"><a name="pos2677"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Before you go on, I don't know if it's only my paper that's a problem, is if you look at 10B, it says, the Court acknowledges the fact that the offence was politically motivated, then, see enclosed separate pages for a brief motivation. Now I take it those are the pages which are numbered 5, 6, 7 and 8. They follow immediately after, are those the pages?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2678"><a name="pos2678"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Chairperson, if it is referred to the page 1 that is written Section 10B and others that follow, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2679"><a name="pos2679"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Then it says, full disclosure, motivation has been submitted to the Department of Justice. Now I don't</p>
<p class="line" id="line2680"><a name="pos2680"></a>1B.	know/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line2681"><a name="pos2681"></a>166</p>
<p class="line" id="line2682"><a name="pos2682"></a>know if we are supposed to have that document before us, I have not seen it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2683"><a name="pos2683"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Chairperson, if I may answer to that query, I, Chairperson, you'll remember yesterday, when the chairperson asked me to seek maximum information relating to some of the co-accused of the applicant here at the trial as to the reasons why they were given indemnity, in my report when, after having consulted with the applicant, I gather from them that after this happened, when some of them were given this indemnity, they themselves, the applicant included could not understand the reason why. And as a result of that there was a discontent among themselves and they petitioned, they wrote the Justice Department and the disclosure that is referred here, is the submission that the applicants made to the Justice Department in connection with the matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2684"><a name="pos2684"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Well it still doesn't answer my question, should we get hold of it, do they want us, because he has referred to it in his application, does he want us to have sight of it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2685"><a name="pos2685"></a>2A.	know/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line2686"><a name="pos2686"></a>167</p>
<p class="line" id="line2687"><a name="pos2687"></a>know where that document is, maybe it's lost, maybe we may never be able to find it. Tell us the things that are contained in that document which have not been covered in your oral evidence so far and which are not covered in the documents you have submitted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2688"><a name="pos2688"></a><span class="speaker">MR GCINISIZWE:</span> The first thing has to do with the attack on Bareng Letia by Nzimeni's group.  Baring Letia was the member of the Executive of the African Youth Congress and he later became the executive member of the Executive Youth League after the ANC-.  Baring we took him after having made efforts of having to make peace meetings between us and Nzimeni, because our perception that we were trying to explain to Nzimeni the transformation from SAYCO to African National Congress Youth League. After that we sent Baring to the police station to go and lay charges against this group and he did so and he lay charges against Nzimeni and his group, and no arrests were ever made and Nzimeni and the other people who assaulted Baring.  The second one relates to the issue of Violet.  Violet was a member of ANC Womens' League, she was attacked by Nzimeni at her house.  Apparently if I remember clearly, Violet was pregnant then and after they have beaten her up and harassed her and it seems she got a miscarriage due to that and no arrests were made in respect to that after that event. And due to intervention of Mary Agnes she discussed it with the Lawyer for Human Rights.  After having discussed with the Lawyer for Human Rights that they must try and follow this issue for Nzimeni regarding Violet's issue, two people were arrested, and after that they were given lenient sentences of two years each after all the things that they did to Comrade Violet who was an active of the ANC Womens' League.  2A.	Those/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line2689"><a name="pos2689"></a>168</p>
<p class="line" id="line2690"><a name="pos2690"></a>Those are some of the things that I remember clearly that we never showed them in this document. By not showing them we thought that maybe the Justice Department would have forwarded the documents already buffer the Amnesty Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2691"><a name="pos2691"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Are you now satisfied that we have now covered those issues, at least those that you can remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2692"><a name="pos2692"></a><span class="speaker">MR GCINISIZWE:</span> Ja I think the one other thing that's important here is that we were not happy to leave our parents behind, our sisters and our brothers.  We were forced by Nzimeni and the situation in the location there that we ran away from our homes to stay in other places.  Mary Agnes' house was our political base.  We couldn't have workshops that were organised by the ANC branch in our location.We could not recruit members to join ANC and as an executive member of the ANC, that was my responsibility of recruiting people to join the ANC. We could not go forward with all these activities because of fear and because of Nzimeni's terrorism because he was targeting activists and he harassed our parents, telling them how much he wants our heads.He went to Comrade Siabongasen, Comrade Frans, Comrade Medhlamini.  We couldn't just go on our own at this age, but I had to have marshals all the time, there was no privacy in my life at all, (..indistinct) activities and other comrades as well. Mary Agnes was working in West Vaal Hospital.  She had to be escorted every day to work to make sure that her transport was safe.  These are some of the things that we covered in our motivation that are not in this briefing.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2703"><a name="pos2703"></a><span class="speaker">MR GCINISIZWE:</span> In court I explained to them about the role that I played, but I didn't mention that I found myself guilty because of not having stopped the comrades for beating and killing Nzimeni because I was scared that I'd be sentenced and I didn't trust courts at that time.  I saw courts as instruments of the National Party Government. That's how I recognised them. I didn't regard courts at all.

<p class="line" id="line2716"><a name="pos2716"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> That you were there when the killing took place?  That you watched it, did you tell him that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2717"><a name="pos2717"></a><span class="speaker">MR GCINISIZWE:</span> Yes I told him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2718"><a name="pos2718"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> And then he led you to give evidence saying you weren't there, you were at Mrs Botman's, is that what you say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2719"><a name="pos2719"></a><span class="speaker">MR GCINISIZWE:</span> Yes because we did consult with him and he did advise us what are the things to say so that we should be on the safe side and not be sentenced. We did consult with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2720"><a name="pos2720"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Mr Mpshe, are there any questions you wish to put to this witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2721"><a name="pos2721"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Yes Mr Chairperson.  Mr Gcinisizwe, in your evidence you testified to the effect that Nzimeni came back in a Combi and threw explosives at Mary Agnes' house.  Did</p>
<p class="line" id="line2722"><a name="pos2722"></a>2A.	you/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line2723"><a name="pos2723"></a>170</p>
<p class="line" id="line2724"><a name="pos2724"></a>you witness this?   </p>
<p class="line" id="line2725"><a name="pos2725"></a><span class="speaker">MR GCINISIZWE:</span> Yes it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2726"><a name="pos2726"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Now can you tell the Committee why was it necessary for the marshals to stay at Mary Agnes' house, the marshals?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2727"><a name="pos2727"></a><span class="speaker">MR GCINISIZWE:</span> Firstly, Mary Agnes was targeted by Nzimeni, she was highly threatened by Nzimeni and she was told that he wants her head and even the marshals, we were staying there in order to protect ourselves because we knew that we would be able to protect ourselves if they attacked us there, and we were to protect Mary Agnes as well who was very prominent in our location at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2728"><a name="pos2728"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Besides the ANC activists being targeted, were other people who were not ANC also targeted by Nzimeni's group, or attacked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2729"><a name="pos2729"></a><span class="speaker">MR GCINISIZWE:</span> I'm not aware about being targeted but I know that there were people that were terrorised by this group but who had not been members of the ANC and who were not prominent in the ranks of the ANC.  People in the squatter camps and that is why their cases were being referred to the police station, so that the police should be the ones to take action against Nzimeni.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2730"><a name="pos2730"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> The activists and non-activists, who were most targeted by Nzimeni's group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2731"><a name="pos2731"></a><span class="speaker">MR GCINISIZWE:</span> Everybody was targeted.  We did everything in defence of ourselves and defence of our membership and defence of the community as well.  The Civic Association had political ties with certain structures that were political</p>
<p class="line" id="line2732"><a name="pos2732"></a>and it's for protecting the community in general.  We had to defend ourselves, our members and our community.            ADV MPSHE:   I will repeat my question. Between activists </p>
<p class="line" id="line2733"><a name="pos2733"></a>2A.	and/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line2734"><a name="pos2734"></a>171</p>
<p class="line" id="line2735"><a name="pos2735"></a>and non-activists, who were most targeted by Nzimeni's group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2736"><a name="pos2736"></a><span class="speaker">MR GCINISIZWE:</span> The most targeted were ANC members,  ANC activists, I am sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2737"><a name="pos2737"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> You have just commented Nzimeni told you that they were KUYOB or called themselves KUYOB or KUYOC, what was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2738"><a name="pos2738"></a><span class="speaker">MR GCINISIZWE:</span> KUYOC is the Kuma Youth Congress.  After the formation of the ANC Youth Congress in 1985, if I remember well, all locations that were affiliated to SAYCO, they were calling themselves according to their location, like for instance, if you are in Kuma its Kuma Congress, if you are in Ganana it's Ganana Youth Congress in that era of 1986. After the unbanning there were other developments between SAYCO that all locations that are affiliate to SAYCO, should  say South African Youth Congress Kuma Branch. They must identify themselves as branches under South African Youth Congress and that is where KUYOC came from. When he calls himself a member of KUYOC, he's believing in things that were done in 1986, things that were done in the violence then, properties being burned down.  He was believing in that era, he's a member of KUYOC and they were also claiming that Comrade Muganyo Raymond Elij(?) who was in jail then serving a seven year sentence in public violence, we chose him as our president of the South African Youth Congress and they were claiming that he was their president, and we had to clarify that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2739"><a name="pos2739"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Now you testified further that Nzimeni was an informer and he was informing for Mr de Kock and Mr Pretorius who are police officers. What made you come to this conclusion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2740"><a name="pos2740"></a>2A.	MR GCINISIZWE:/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line2741"><a name="pos2741"></a>172</p>
<p class="line" id="line2742"><a name="pos2742"></a><span class="speaker">MR GCINISIZWE:</span> The thing that made us to come to that conclusion is because of the revelation by Charles Mhlambiso stating that him and Nzimeni were spies and he himself, he is an interpreter between Nzimeni and de Kock and Pretorius in their meetings that we were not aware where they're being held.  That's one of the things that made us to believe that Nzimeni's working with the police definitely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2743"><a name="pos2743"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> If you know what were the ranks of the two police officers, de Kock and Pretorius then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2744"><a name="pos2744"></a><span class="speaker">MR GCINISIZWE:</span> I don't remember, I can never know.  I disregarded their ranks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2745"><a name="pos2745"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Would you say they were senior police officers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2746"><a name="pos2746"></a><span class="speaker">MR GCINISIZWE:</span> I can never know because about ranks I'm not aware.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2747"><a name="pos2747"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Did you know these police officers yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2748"><a name="pos2748"></a><span class="speaker">MR GCINISIZWE:</span> Yes I knew de Kock and Pretorius.  Yes I knew them both.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2749"><a name="pos2749"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> How did you come to know them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2750"><a name="pos2750"></a><span class="speaker">MR GCINISIZWE:</span> De Kock beat Mary Agnes at her house during the State of Emergency 1990 and Mary Agnes laid a charge against de Kock.  Therefore de Kock came back after some time after that charge that was laid by Baring Letia who was beaten up by Nzimeni stating that attorney general in those cases, regarding those cases opened by the two comrades, Mr Baring Letia and Mary Agnes Kuma, and therefore I knew him personally.  And at one stage he banned comrade Mary Agnes and Comrade Steven Geme, who was just come back from prison then, he was a member of the executive of the youth. He banned them to address not more than ten people.  That's how I know de Kock.  Furthermore there was a march that was organised by the comrades in the location to the police</p>
<p class="line" id="line2751"><a name="pos2751"></a>2A.	station/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line2752"><a name="pos2752"></a>173</p>
<p class="line" id="line2753"><a name="pos2753"></a>station.  I think it was 1991 after all these things in the location.  De Kock instructed policemen that were present they must shoot these marshals with tear gas and everything. I just arrived from the location, I got the report by Mr Mkontwana who tried to intervene in the confrontation between the police and the comrades.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2754"><a name="pos2754"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Where were these two police officers stationed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2755"><a name="pos2755"></a><span class="speaker">MR GCINISIZWE:</span> I'm not sure. Police move around.  Sometimes they're in Klerksdorp, sometimes in Stilfontein, wherever there's activities, wherever the ANC is. I once saw him at a funeral in Maraisdal, they were there both of them.  Wherever there were activities that were strong by the ANC particularly, they were always there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2756"><a name="pos2756"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> No further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2757"><a name="pos2757"></a><span class="speaker">MS SISI KHAMPEPE:</span> Mr Gcinisizwe, in your motivational statement which is attached to your application you have stated that you were informed by some defectors from the Nzimeni group of that Nzimeni was conniving with Mr de Kock and Mr Pretorius.  You have only managed to indicate so far the name of Mr Mhlambiso, is he one of the defectors who informed you of this information?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2758"><a name="pos2758"></a><span class="speaker">MR GCINISIZWE:</span> Yes, the one other person who, it was Kumbeni, the one who ran away the 30th of October 1990, when we caught him and we took him to Mary Agnes' house, and he also confirmed the collusion between de Kock and Nzimeni.  They were never arrested these people, even when we took them to the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2759"><a name="pos2759"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Yes thank you very much.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2763"><a name="pos2763"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Chairperson, I intend calling the next witness, Patrick Umkontwana. Patrick Umkontwana will be giving his evidence in Xhosa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2764"><a name="pos2764"></a><span class="speaker">PATRICK UMKONTWANA:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line2765"><a name="pos2765"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Chairperson I wish it be put on record that the statement by the applicant before you is similar in contents in the statement of the previous applicant and therefore I do not intend to let him repeat what was repeated by the first applicant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2766"><a name="pos2766"></a>	Patrick, the application before this Committee for amnesty relates to the act of murder and attempted murder on the 31st of October 1990. Murder, it's the death of Nzimeni and where Charles Mhlambiso was almost killed.  What the Committee would like to know from you is the actual role that you played.  Did you kill Nzimeni?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2767"><a name="pos2767"></a><span class="speaker">MR UMKONTWANA:</span> I will start by saying, on the 31st of October 1990, it was in the morning, we went out as comrades going to look for Nzimeni and them.  That was the day after the 30th in 1990.  I can mention comrade Frans Masike, Albie Fasie, Shepherd Charlie, Solomon Mangew, Cqemisiswe  Llandwa, Mishak Popane, Andrew Muloto and others. When we arrived at the taxi rank we were looking for a taxi that was transporting Nzimeni and his group.  We got to the driver, it was a Combi belonging to Mr Makasi, W E Makasi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2768"><a name="pos2768"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> I think some of this evidence has already been led.  I think you must ask him not whether he murdered, whether he took part in the murder of the deceased, and ask him how or what was his part.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2769"><a name="pos2769"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Patrick, we, when I addressed this Committee before, I said I intend not making you repeat what your co-applicant had already said.  Only in a nutshell, we know</p>
<p class="line" id="line2770"><a name="pos2770"></a>2A.	already/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line2771"><a name="pos2771"></a>174</p>
<p class="line" id="line2772"><a name="pos2772"></a>already that you went hunting for Nzimeni but let's come to the time that you found Nzimeni.  When Nzimeni was being </p>
<p class="line" id="line2773"><a name="pos2773"></a>stabbed with pangas, stoned, you were present there, isn't it?   What role did you play there?  What did you do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2774"><a name="pos2774"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> I don't want to interfere, but as I understand it, there was an earlier crime that he was convicted of, that's the attempted murder and he's asking for amnesty for that too, so I don't think you should cut him that short.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2775"><a name="pos2775"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Chairperson I'm leading the applicant on the question of murder.  He will be led as well on the attempted murder charge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2776"><a name="pos2776"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> I think what my brother is saying to you is that if my impression is correct, the attempted murder was committed first and then the murder later, and to take the witness and make him jump around like that, he's going to get confused.  So let him narrate the events in sequence, in the order in which they came. If I'm correct in thinking that the attempted murder was committed first, let him start with first things first to avoid him being confused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2777"><a name="pos2777"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Chairperson I will accept the directions from the Committee.  Patrick, then I will ask you then to revert back to the taxi rank to the instance where Charles Mhlambiso was found. Then what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2778"><a name="pos2778"></a><span class="speaker">MR UMKONTWANA:</span> The first person to saw Charles was Ranka Solomon.  He pointed at Charles Mhlambiso, and then we ranked what's his direction. I was the first person to reach where he was and I grabbed him.  I said Charles, tell me what are you guys doing?  And he said to me, what are you talking about, my brother? And other comrades came and on their arrival I was still holding him with my hands and they 2A.	started/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line2779"><a name="pos2779"></a>175</p>
<p class="line" id="line2780"><a name="pos2780"></a>started beating him. And this thing troubled me because  matters seemed to be getting very difficult, and I pushed him into furrow, trying to save him and the comrades followed, they got into the furrow and they assaulted him in that furrow. And Pina Tlandsizwe Tlanjwa came out and then we helped each other, we stopped the comrades not to carry on with this act. Charles was already poured with petrol and we asked Solomon and Mututuzeli Luma to take Charles Mhlambiso to the police station.  They took him, they left with him, they took him to the police station.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2781"><a name="pos2781"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Did you do anything to Charles other than pushing him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2782"><a name="pos2782"></a><span class="speaker">MR UMKONTWANA:</span> Besides grabbing him and pushing him into the furrow, there's nothing else I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2783"><a name="pos2783"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> And that was done to save him did you say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2784"><a name="pos2784"></a><span class="speaker">MR UMKONTWANA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2785"><a name="pos2785"></a>(Tape 2A ends).</p>
<p class="line" id="line2786"><a name="pos2786"></a>(Start tape 2B day 3)</p>
<p class="line" id="line2787"><a name="pos2787"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> ....then pushed him into the furrow.  When you grabbed him the first time that was not to save him. To save him was when you pushed him into the furrow. Am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2788"><a name="pos2788"></a><span class="speaker">MR UMKONTWANA:</span> Can I please repeat that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2789"><a name="pos2789"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> You were the first person to grab him, at that stage there was no question of saving him, you were just grabbing him.  And then he got assaulted and then you pushed him into the furrow.  By pushing him into the furrow, you were trying to save him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2790"><a name="pos2790"></a><span class="speaker">MR UMKONTWANA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2791"><a name="pos2791"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Let's move to the question of murder.  How did then you come to Nzimeni and what happened to him, what role did you play there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2792"><a name="pos2792"></a>2B.	MR UMKONTWANA:/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line2793"><a name="pos2793"></a>176</p>
<p class="line" id="line2794"><a name="pos2794"></a><span class="speaker">MR UMKONTWANA:</span> I didn't do anything even in his killing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2795"><a name="pos2795"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> What is there that you saw happening to Nzimeni in your presence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2796"><a name="pos2796"></a><span class="speaker">MR UMKONTWANA:</span> Would I start just at the back so that I can bring facts. After Charlie was taken to the police station we were now left with another problem which is Nzimeni. Tqhina got into Nzimeni's yard and I was following him and the mother to the deceased asked where is Nzimeni. And then the answer was Nzimeni fled. Tqhina went out of the house with the mother of the deceased, they were using the front entrance, and I was following them.  As I was still waiting the mother to the deceased came back, I don't know where she was coming from but she was using the other street, Dingaan Street, and she got into the yard and she used the back entrance and then I followed her.  Every time, or all the time I was under the impression that Nzimeni was not present, he fled.  My home was very close to Nzimeni's home.  She was moving at the front and I was behind her, and she got into her house and she jumped fences, she was running, I don't know which direction she was taking and as I was walking I heard a noise behind me, and as I turned I saw a group of people using the passage that was leading to the taxi rank and I said, let me follow, and then I followed. That is where I saw Nzimeni being assaulted, being stabbed with iron bars, everything was on his body and he fell at the taxi rank site and that was the end of him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2797"><a name="pos2797"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Who did you see assaulting Nzimeni? Can you mention, name them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2798"><a name="pos2798"></a><span class="speaker">MR UMKONTWANA:</span> Frans Masike, Bulelane Ngoloma, Shephard Charlie, Albie Fasie, Baring Letia and others whom I cannot remember their names.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2801"><a name="pos2801"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Patrick, the impression conveyed to this Committee is that you did not take part in the two acts. Can you then elaborate or explain, what do you think then why were you convicted for the two charges?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2802"><a name="pos2802"></a><span class="speaker">MR UMKONTWANA:</span> I was arrested and I appeared before the court of law and I gave the evidence that I'm giving you now. But I was sentenced.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2803"><a name="pos2803"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> The question is why do you think you were convicted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2804"><a name="pos2804"></a><span class="speaker">MR UMKONTWANA:</span> I don't know but I think it's because I was a leader in the youth organisation in the township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2805"><a name="pos2805"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> What leadership positions did you occupy in the South African Youth Congress Kuma Branch and the ANC Youth Congress?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2806"><a name="pos2806"></a><span class="speaker">MR UMKONTWANA:</span> I was the publicity and media officer for the SAYCO Kuma Branch in 1990, and when it was transformed to the ANC Youth League, Stilfontein Branch I was still their publicity media officer.  In 1991 I was elected to be the chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2807"><a name="pos2807"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> At the time of the assault of Nzimeni, do you think or would you say that had you had the necessary muscle at the time or the power at the time, to could have saved him from the mob or from the people that you mention to have assaulted him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2808"><a name="pos2808"></a><span class="speaker">MR UMKONTWANA:</span> The powers were there to intervene but the anger of the people would have never been stopped by those powers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2809"><a name="pos2809"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> But you think that had you intervened or showed an attempt to intervene you would have probably saved the life of Nzimeni?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2810"><a name="pos2810"></a><span class="speaker">MR UMKONTWANA:</span> I think so.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2815"><a name="pos2815"></a><span class="speaker">MR UMKONTWANA:</span> I said I was following them as the action was taking place.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2832"><a name="pos2832"></a><span class="speaker">MR UMKONTWANA:</span> Yes I did not agree with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2833"><a name="pos2833"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Is the position that the mother of the deceased only arrived at the scene only some time after he had been attacked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2834"><a name="pos2834"></a><span class="speaker">MR UMKONTWANA:</span> I do not know whether she arrived at the place of the incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2835"><a name="pos2835"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Did you not see her there?</p>

<p class="line" id="line2837"><a name="pos2837"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> How many people participated in the attack on Nzimeni?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2838"><a name="pos2838"></a><span class="speaker">MR UMKONTWANA:</span> I won't be very specific with the number but there were many.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2839"><a name="pos2839"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Were they all members of the, were they in the Executive or in the leadership of the Youth Congress?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2840"><a name="pos2840"></a><span class="speaker">MR UMKONTWANA:</span> Some were in the Executive and some were just ordinary members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2841"><a name="pos2841"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> So it was a large group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2842"><a name="pos2842"></a><span class="speaker">MR UMKONTWANA:</span> It wasn't big, that large group.  It wasn't even more than 50, not even more than 30.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2843"><a name="pos2843"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> When Nzimeni was assaulted were you within a reasonable distance to have been able to stop the fight when he was initially assaulted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2844"><a name="pos2844"></a><span class="speaker">MR UMKONTWANA:</span> I can say yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2845"><a name="pos2845"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Were you then in his mother's house at that time?</p>

<p class="line" id="line2854"><a name="pos2854"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> I believe the deceased was not there that he'd fled from the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2855"><a name="pos2855"></a><span class="speaker">MR UMKONTWANA:</span> That I mentioned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2856"><a name="pos2856"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> You then said my house was nearby.  And the mother then went across yards, jumped across the fences. Do you remember telling us that?</p>

<p class="line" id="line2858"><a name="pos2858"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> What did you say that she did there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2859"><a name="pos2859"></a><span class="speaker">MR UMKONTWANA:</span> What I said was, as we used the back entrance following the mother to the deceased, we used the street that I stay in and she got into the other yard and she jumped the fence, I don't know where she was going to, and as I was on the way I heard a noise and immediately I turned back, and that is when I saw what was happening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2860"><a name="pos2860"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> They were attacking him in the lane?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2861"><a name="pos2861"></a><span class="speaker">MR UMKONTWANA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2862"><a name="pos2862"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Wasn't the deceased hiding in his mother's house and wasn't he taken from his mother's house into the street?</p>

<p class="line" id="line2864"><a name="pos2864"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Wasn't that the evidence at the trial?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2865"><a name="pos2865"></a><span class="speaker">MR UMKONTWANA:</span> That was the evidence I gave.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2871"><a name="pos2871"></a><span class="speaker">MR UMKONTWANA:</span> If I remember well, it was other people giving the evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2872"><a name="pos2872"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> And they said he was removed from his mother's house and then murdered outside?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2873"><a name="pos2873"></a><span class="speaker">MR UMKONTWANA:</span> I do not know whether they said that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2874"><a name="pos2874"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> How far from his mother's house was he killed, could you point out or indicate to us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2875"><a name="pos2875"></a><span class="speaker">MR UMKONTWANA:</span> The taxi rank is situated here where I am and his mother's house was situated next to the stadium where the fence of the stadium begins.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2876"><a name="pos2876"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> I know it's difficult to sort of give distances but could you give us an estimate of the distance? Fifty yards, round about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2877"><a name="pos2877"></a><span class="speaker">MR UMKONTWANA:</span> It can be a hundred and twenty metres.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2878"><a name="pos2878"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> And was it in the street in front of his mother's house or at the back side of the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2879"><a name="pos2879"></a><span class="speaker">MR UMKONTWANA:</span> They used the front side.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2880"><a name="pos2880"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> And is there a street going past his mother's house in the front leading to the taxi rank or what passage or corridor did you speak of?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2881"><a name="pos2881"></a><span class="speaker">MR UMKONTWANA:</span> Can I please explain to the Committee how the house was situated?  When you move from the taxi rank, you go up the street to the right direction as I'm sitting, and the back entrance to the deceased's house would be on the other side, it would be on Dingaan Street, but the people approached from Dingaan Street, using this passage that is leading from the taxi rank to Dingaan Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2882"><a name="pos2882"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> I see.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2883"><a name="pos2883"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> When you ran after Charles, you say you were the first person to reach him and you grabbed him and said,</p>

<p class="line" id="line2886"><a name="pos2886"></a>what are you boys doing, did you mean to injure him or hurt him in any way when you grabbed him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2887"><a name="pos2887"></a><span class="speaker">MR UMKONTWANA:</span> The intention was to take him to the</p>
<p class="line" id="line2888"><a name="pos2888"></a>police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2889"><a name="pos2889"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> And he called you, brother, then.  Is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2890"><a name="pos2890"></a><span class="speaker">MR UMKONTWANA:</span> Yes it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2891"><a name="pos2891"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2892"><a name="pos2892"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Well you have told us that is what you effectively said during your trial that you only grabbed him and then next thing was that you pushed him into the furrow to save him.  When you grabbed him you must have realised that the comrades, that is all these people that were looking for him were angry.  Isn't that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2893"><a name="pos2893"></a><span class="speaker">MR UMKONTWANA:</span> I'm not sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2894"><a name="pos2894"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> What do you mean, you were there?  You were with them?  You are the person who should be in a position to can tell the mood of the comrades.  Why they went out looking for somebody.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2895"><a name="pos2895"></a><span class="speaker">MR UMKONTWANA:</span> As they were going along there were no signs of anger among the comrades at that moment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2896"><a name="pos2896"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Did you not realise that once you grab him emotions may run high and he might be assaulted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2897"><a name="pos2897"></a><span class="speaker">MR UMKONTWANA:</span> No I never did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2898"><a name="pos2898"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Isn't that what the court found? If you can't tell me say so but I'm trying to figure out why you could possibly have been convicted, on your version.  Didn't the Judge say to you when you caught this man, you realised the people were angry, you must have realised they were going to assault him, didn't the Judge say that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2899"><a name="pos2899"></a><span class="speaker">MR UMKONTWANA:</span> I don't remember clearly him saying that.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2902"><a name="pos2902"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> I thought you would because that was quite a critical stage in your life.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2903"><a name="pos2903"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> When you grabbed hold of Charles you knew that</p>
<p class="line" id="line2904"><a name="pos2904"></a>the comrades carried arms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2905"><a name="pos2905"></a><span class="speaker">MR UMKONTWANA:</span> Yes I knew.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2906"><a name="pos2906"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> And you must have known that they intended using those arms, did you not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2907"><a name="pos2907"></a><span class="speaker">MR UMKONTWANA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2908"><a name="pos2908"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> What did you think they were going to do with these arms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2909"><a name="pos2909"></a><span class="speaker">MR UMKONTWANA:</span> We were always armed.  It was pangas and kerries and iron objects.  It was quite clear then that the situation in the location is not so conducive any more.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2910"><a name="pos2910"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> So you all walked around walking with these deadly instruments without any intention of doing anything wrong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2911"><a name="pos2911"></a><span class="speaker">MR UMKONTWANA:</span> We would use them if the need arises.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2912"><a name="pos2912"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> I thought people arm themselves because they know that the need has arisen for them to take arms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2913"><a name="pos2913"></a><span class="speaker">MR UMKONTWANA:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2914"><a name="pos2914"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Is it correct that you were looking for Nzimeni, the deceased that morning when you went to the taxi rank?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2915"><a name="pos2915"></a><span class="speaker">MR UMKONTWANA:</span> Nzimeni and the group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2916"><a name="pos2916"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Nzimeni was the main target, he was the man who had thrown the bomb, the explosive?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2917"><a name="pos2917"></a><span class="speaker">MR UMKONTWANA:</span> Yes it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2918"><a name="pos2918"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> You wanted information from Charles and other members of the group as to where to find him? Is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2919"><a name="pos2919"></a><span class="speaker">MR UMKONTWANA:</span> May you please repeat your question?</p>

<p class="line" id="line2922"><a name="pos2922"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> You wanted to find out from Charles or from other members of the group where to find him, where he'd gone to, you thought he'd gone somewhere, didn't you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2923"><a name="pos2923"></a><span class="speaker">MR UMKONTWANA:</span> No it's not so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2924"><a name="pos2924"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Why did you go to the taxi rank at all?  Why didn't you just go to his home, it was just around the corner?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2925"><a name="pos2925"></a><span class="speaker">MR UMKONTWANA:</span> At the taxi rank the main thing that we were looking for was the driver of the Combi who was, who had transported Nzimeni's group, so that he should tell us exactly where did he drop them off.  Then we could take it off, then to try and go and find them wherever he dropped them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2926"><a name="pos2926"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> You didn't think it worthwhile going to his home first?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2927"><a name="pos2927"></a><span class="speaker">MR UMKONTWANA:</span> It would be easy but it's just that the thought came that we should start at the rank first.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2928"><a name="pos2928"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Was that the real reason for going to the rank or were you trying to stir up trouble for him? You didn't just talk to one taxi driver did you, you talked to them all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2929"><a name="pos2929"></a><span class="speaker">MR UMKONTWANA:</span> Whilst we were talking to this taxi driver for this Combi, the other taxi drivers came closer.  We could not chase them away because it was also affecting them as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2930"><a name="pos2930"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2931"><a name="pos2931"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> After Charles was assaulted he was taken to the police station, was he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2932"><a name="pos2932"></a><span class="speaker">MR UMKONTWANA:</span> Yes it is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2933"><a name="pos2933"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Were you one of those who told the police that you had assaulted him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2934"><a name="pos2934"></a>2B.	MR UMKONTWANA:/...</p>

<p class="line" id="line2938"><a name="pos2938"></a><span class="speaker">MR UMKONTWANA:</span> No I never did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2939"><a name="pos2939"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> So Charles was badly assaulted, he was taken to</p>
<p class="line" id="line2940"><a name="pos2940"></a>the police station.  What was the purpose of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2941"><a name="pos2941"></a><span class="speaker">MR UMKONTWANA:</span> The decision of the meeting held that day or any of these members that would be found would be taken to the police station.  So we were caring out that decision.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2942"><a name="pos2942"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> So the decision was that they should be beaten up first before they were taken to the police station?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2943"><a name="pos2943"></a><span class="speaker">MR UMKONTWANA:</span> No that was not the decision.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2944"><a name="pos2944"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Was Charles beaten up in order to discipline him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2945"><a name="pos2945"></a><span class="speaker">MR UMKONTWANA:</span> I don't know why did the comrades beat him up, whether to discipline him or not, I'm not sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2946"><a name="pos2946"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> They meant to kill him didn't they, they poured petrol on him? Is that not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2947"><a name="pos2947"></a><span class="speaker">MR UMKONTWANA:</span> Yes it is so, they did pour petrol over him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2948"><a name="pos2948"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> At the trial was it disclosed to the Judge that they wanted to discipline him or that they, what the intention was or the purpose of beating him or killing the other one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2949"><a name="pos2949"></a><span class="speaker">MR UMKONTWANA:</span> I don't remember clearly, but I don't think we did say that he was being disciplined or not.</p>

<p class="line" id="line2977"><a name="pos2977"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Chairperson, also in this instance, for record purposes the statements, motivations thereon, are similar to those of the first two applicants.  I therefore will not take the applicant to repeat what has already been said here.  Mr Popane, what leadership positions did you occupy in the Youth Congress of the ANC in Kuma during the period of '90, 1990?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2978"><a name="pos2978"></a><span class="speaker">MR POPANE:</span> As from 1990, I was an additional member of South African Youth Congress.  Then again I became an additional member in the African National Congress Youth League.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2979"><a name="pos2979"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> You know already that the acts that you are now asking this Committee to grant you amnesty on, it is the one of murder of a certain Mr Mzimeni and the assault on Charles Mhlambiso.  I am going to start with this act of attempted murder on Charles Mhlambiso.  Did you as Mishek Misowa Popane, assault Charles Mhlambiso on the 31st of October 1990?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2980"><a name="pos2980"></a><span class="speaker">MR POPANE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2981"><a name="pos2981"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Can you explain to this Committee, how and with what did you assault Charles Mhlambiso?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2982"><a name="pos2982"></a><span class="speaker">MR POPANE:</span> As my co-accused have already explained, we were from Mary Agnes' house going to the taxi rank looking</p>

<p class="line" id="line2984"><a name="pos2984"></a>187</p>
<p class="line" id="line2985"><a name="pos2985"></a>for the taxi driver, the Combi which transported the vigilante gang. We arrived and talked to the driver who transported these people, then he told us it was not him, it was somebody else.  When we were still there we saw Charles being chased by other comrades.  I rushed to the scene.  When I arrived there, I took the stone and threw at him just in the furrow where he was thrown by Umkontwani, then I hit him with a stone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2986"><a name="pos2986"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> How many stones did you use to hit Charles Mhlambiso?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2987"><a name="pos2987"></a><span class="speaker">MR POPANE:</span> I used only one stone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2988"><a name="pos2988"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Let's move to the murder of Mr Mzimeni. Can you explain to the Committee the part that you played in the killing of this Mzimeni?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2989"><a name="pos2989"></a><span class="speaker">MR POPANE:</span> Whilst the comrades were entering the house of the deceased looking for him, they couldn't find him there.  I went at the back of them when they were all of them out, then I went into the house to look for him.  I entered through the window because at the time the doors were opened, then I entered through the window.  Then I found the wife of the deceased and a certain lady called Lizzie inside one of the rooms.  When they saw me to believe that maybe the deceased is in the house.  The way they were acting they were acting suspicious to show me that maybe the deceased is inside the house.  They were looking frightened.  The wife of the deceased took off the clothes and then he said he should not talk, she will give me.  She took off her clothes that I should tell other comrades. As a disciplined member I knew that I didn't come here to have sex with her. I went straight to the wardrobe then opened the wardrobe and then pick him out. Their eyes when they were talking with me,</p>
<p class="line" id="line2990"><a name="pos2990"></a>3A.	they/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line2991"><a name="pos2991"></a>187</p>
<p class="line" id="line2992"><a name="pos2992"></a>they were showing me that there is something in a wardrobe, then I went directly to the wardrobe, then I took him off the wardrobe.  They tried to plead with me, the wife exposed her thighs, so that I should just keep silent, because the comrades are angry they may kill her husband.  Then I took him by the hand then I shouted, then I shouted at the comrades that the person they are looking for, here is he, who is a liar. The first one who arrived first is Frans Masike, he's the one who met with me after I've shouted, then he entered.  Then he was followed by other comrades.  Then they took him off outside the house, it is then that he started being assaulted, then other comrades came again, some of them were comrade Andrew Moloto, Comrade Rangamanju, Comrade Bulelane, Comrade Coloma, Comrade Charlie, Comrade Albie Fasie. When he went out of the house he was assaulted already.  We went out through the door, being assaulted at the time. At the time other comrades were coming again and there were many.  Then they took him out, they turned through the passage, to the taxi rank.  I was following other comrades. When they were still assaulting him, those which I have already explained about, Comrade Frans was having a knife in his hand and Comrade Bulelane also was having a knife in his hand.  They stabbed him on the neck.  At the time he was powerless and then Comrade Bulelane were the ones who finished him off.  After that other people came with their stones and hitting him.  Comrade Andrew Moloto, when he was already finished, at that time he was having petrol, Comrade Moloto sprinkled him with petrol and he wanted to burn him.  It was not possible, one of the comrades prevented him not to burn him because he's already dead. Thereafter, then we went to Mary Agnes, at the time </p>
<p class="line" id="line2993"><a name="pos2993"></a>3A.	the/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line2994"><a name="pos2994"></a>188</p>
<p class="line" id="line2995"><a name="pos2995"></a>the deceased was dead and the police came, then we went to Mary Agnes' house.  We advised the comrades who were seen doing the act to leave.  To the wife of the deceased I ask forgiveness what I have done because now she doesn't have the husband anymore. To the mother of the deceased, to Mrs Mazwi, I say sorry because she doesn't have a child any more and because of that I really ask for forgiveness and not forgetting to Charles I ask him forgiveness.  As we are now in the time for reconciliation we should forget what has passed. Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2996"><a name="pos2996"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> You mentioned that you went through the window. Was this window open or did you break this window for you to enter the house or the bedroom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2997"><a name="pos2997"></a><span class="speaker">MR POPANE:</span> The window was opened, everything was opened all the doors were opened, windows were opened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2998"><a name="pos2998"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> We were advised as to the conduct and activities of the deceased here, Mr Mazwi, now I want to know from you as a member of the political organisation at the time, would you say that such conduct of Mazwi was a hinderance to your activities?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2999"><a name="pos2999"></a><span class="speaker">MR POPANE:</span> They were impinging our political activity at the time. Things which he has done, they were impinging on the political activity.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3000"><a name="pos3000"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3001"><a name="pos3001"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Mr Mpshe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3002"><a name="pos3002"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  The killing of the deceased and the assault on Charles, did it make your organisation attain or achieve anything?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3003"><a name="pos3003"></a><span class="speaker">MR POPANE:</span> I would say his death and assault of the other person did show that there was a sort of freedom in Kuma because thereafter we were able to have our rallies without</p>

<p class="line" id="line3005"><a name="pos3005"></a>189</p>
<p class="line" id="line3006"><a name="pos3006"></a>any disruptions which happened, and the community were able to walk freely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3007"><a name="pos3007"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Couldn't that particular freedom and activity have been achieved by other means other than killing and assaulting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3008"><a name="pos3008"></a><span class="speaker">MR POPANE:</span> We tried to talk with this group.  We had so many meetings with the deceased and his gang, trying to bring solutions peacefully, we failed, all the times have failed to reach a peaceful settlement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3009"><a name="pos3009"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> What attempts were taken by your organisation towards this peace settlement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3010"><a name="pos3010"></a><span class="speaker">MR POPANE:</span> We had so many meetings with the vigilante group, we had a meeting at Vraganelo(?), we had another meeting at AMA Church, where the president of SAYCO was there. We had meetings with the Lawyers for Human Rights.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3011"><a name="pos3011"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> At all the three meetings you have just mentioned, were the vigilantes represented?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3012"><a name="pos3012"></a><span class="speaker">MR POPANE:</span> They had their delegation in the meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3013"><a name="pos3013"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Was Mzimeni one of them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3014"><a name="pos3014"></a><span class="speaker">MR POPANE:</span> In all the meetings we held, he was there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3015"><a name="pos3015"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> In your own opinion would you say Mzimeni and company had some kind of force or authority behind them spurring them to do what they were doing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3016"><a name="pos3016"></a><span class="speaker">MR POPANE:</span> I would say the way we tried to talk with them you'd see that there is something behind them, there is something to make them to do all those things which they did. It was found at a later stage that these people, there is a person behind them and the person who's behind them is Pretorius and de Kock who were policemen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3017"><a name="pos3017"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Had you on your own ever witnessed some form of, or any action indicative of collaboration between the</p>
<p class="line" id="line3018"><a name="pos3018"></a>3A.	two/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line3019"><a name="pos3019"></a>190</p>
<p class="line" id="line3020"><a name="pos3020"></a>two police officers and Mzimeni and company, any incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3021"><a name="pos3021"></a><span class="speaker">MR POPANE:</span> I have never seen any incident except the revelations which were made by one of them whom we have caught when we were, he's the one who talked about that and the other one is, when I entered the SAYCO office, I got a briefing that there were revelations which were made by Charlie to the comrades.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3022"><a name="pos3022"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> Chairman, no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3023"><a name="pos3023"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Weren't Mzimeni and Charles opposed to any peace talk with the police and working together with the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3024"><a name="pos3024"></a><span class="speaker">MR POPANE:</span> Yes they were working together with the police as I said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3025"><a name="pos3025"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> No my question was, were they, they opposed to the formation of the Peace Accord Group and wasn't that the reason why they broke away sort of, from the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3026"><a name="pos3026"></a><span class="speaker">MR POPANE:</span> Altogether they were not prepared to bring peace in the location.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3027"><a name="pos3027"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> And were they against the Peace Accord, the Groote Schuur Minute?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3028"><a name="pos3028"></a><span class="speaker">MR POPANE:</span> It shows that because we went to the meetings, in the meetings which we've held we did make some peace accords and they did agree with the peace accord then.  Thereafter they cast aspersions to their disagreeing with all the accords we have made.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3029"><a name="pos3029"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> And at the mass meetings, didn't they express any opinion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3030"><a name="pos3030"></a><span class="speaker">MR POPANE:</span> Their opinions were not exposed or expressed in public.  They were just coming to disrupt our meetings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3031"><a name="pos3031"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Mr Popane, I just want to make a follow</p>
<p class="line" id="line3032"><a name="pos3032"></a>up on what my committee member has put to you.   When Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line3033"><a name="pos3033"></a>3A.	Mzimeni/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line3034"><a name="pos3034"></a>191</p>
<p class="line" id="line3035"><a name="pos3035"></a>Mzimeni or Mr Mazwi attended the meetings which you had as the working group, did he cooperate with the people who participated in that working group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3036"><a name="pos3036"></a><span class="speaker">MR POPANE:</span> Altogether he was not in agreement and he was not cooperating with all the members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3037"><a name="pos3037"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Yet you would proceed to seal agreements which he in turn would not be able to comply with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3038"><a name="pos3038"></a><span class="speaker">MR POPANE:</span> For us to have these meetings, we were trying to persuade them to come together to talk and negotiate and the interventions we had from all the offices, particularly the offices from Human Rights, and the ministers were trying to bring us together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3039"><a name="pos3039"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> He freely participated in all the meetings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3040"><a name="pos3040"></a><span class="speaker">MR POPANE:</span> Yes.  He was participating in the meetings but he was a kind of a person, in the meeting he didn't have any problem for him to understand whatever we were talking about but the problem is when you go out he would say all what we have talked about, he doesn't agree with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3041"><a name="pos3041"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> His only problem was in implementing the agreements that you would have reached in those meetings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3042"><a name="pos3042"></a><span class="speaker">MR POPANE:</span> It was his problem to fail to implement the decisions we have reached in the meetings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3043"><a name="pos3043"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Sorry can just ask you something, I don't understand this.  There was a working group of which a de Beer, Mr or Mrs de Beer was a member.  Do you know that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3044"><a name="pos3044"></a><span class="speaker">MR POPANE:</span> In the working group, I don't have full information about that because I was not a member of the working group at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3045"><a name="pos3045"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> That may be so but I was not going to ask you whether you know details about it. I just want to find out whether these working groups, of which Mr de Beer was a</p>
<p class="line" id="line3046"><a name="pos3046"></a>3A.	member/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line3047"><a name="pos3047"></a>192</p>
<p class="line" id="line3048"><a name="pos3048"></a>member, what was the attitude of the deceased towards that working group and it's meetings? </p>
<p class="line" id="line3049"><a name="pos3049"></a><span class="speaker">MR POPANE:</span> There was no meeting where the policemen were present when we were discussing in the working group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3050"><a name="pos3050"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Well I mean Mr...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line3051"><a name="pos3051"></a><span class="speaker">MR POPANE:</span> I'm talking about Mr de Kock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3052"><a name="pos3052"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Well I'm talking about Mr de Beer.  One of your co-applicants has told us that there was a working group of which Mr de Beer was apparently a member and that the deceased did not take kindly to this kind of relationship of your organisation working together with the police and you objected against that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3053"><a name="pos3053"></a><span class="speaker">MR POPANE:</span> The deceased didn't like any kind of relationship with the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3054"><a name="pos3054"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> And we were told that his objection was that you can't work with people who are our killers. Wasn't that his attitude?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3055"><a name="pos3055"></a><span class="speaker">MR POPANE:</span> He was advancing that kind of an argument.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3056"><a name="pos3056"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> He did not attend the meetings of that working group of which de Beer was a member?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3057"><a name="pos3057"></a><span class="speaker">MR POPANE:</span> I don't know of any meeting where there was a working group together with the deceased.  What I know, we had meetings where Mr de Beer was not present, it was us comrades and Lawyers for Human Rights and ministers.  In the members of the working group there was no such kind of a meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3058"><a name="pos3058"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Don't go too much ahead because I'm trying to clear something. You rush too much ahead and in the end the picture becomes muddled up again.  I've now finished with the meetings of the working group of which Mr de Beer was a member.  You have just told me that you have no</p>

<p class="line" id="line3060"><a name="pos3060"></a>193</p>
<p class="line" id="line3061"><a name="pos3061"></a>knowledge as to whether the deceased attended those meetings. I'm leaving those meetings, the meetings of that group.  Now I'm going to ask you about, just a minute ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line3062"><a name="pos3062"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Does he know of de Beer being a member of a working group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3063"><a name="pos3063"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Presumably.  Now I'm leaving the meetings of the working group of which Mr de Beer was a member.  Now you have told us that your organisation had meetings with the deceased in order to try and bring about some peace, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3064"><a name="pos3064"></a><span class="speaker">MR POPANE:</span> Yes Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3065"><a name="pos3065"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Many meetings, for example the one which was held under the auspices of Lawyers for Human Rights and so on and so forth, and all these meetings did not produce any results, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3066"><a name="pos3066"></a><span class="speaker">MR POPANE:</span> Yes Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3067"><a name="pos3067"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> To go back to Mr de Beer, were you aware that he was a member of a working group to which the deceased objected, in which the deceased felt you should not participate because you'd be participating with your killers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3068"><a name="pos3068"></a><span class="speaker">MR POPANE:</span> I was aware because of the briefing from my comrades because as a member of the Executive Committee, my fellow comrades were briefing me in that regard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3069"><a name="pos3069"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> We know that there were certain meetings of the working group in which de Beer was a member which you did not attend, but you at the meetings which you attended, and the discussions of peace which you attended, were your organisation's meetings with the deceased. Am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3070"><a name="pos3070"></a><span class="speaker">MR POPANE:</span> May you repeat your question?</p>

<p class="line" id="line3080"><a name="pos3080"></a><span class="speaker">MR POPANE:</span> In the meetings.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3086"><a name="pos3086"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Can you tell me what they are?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3087"><a name="pos3087"></a><span class="speaker">MR POPANE:</span> Our differences were, they were saying that we are in cahoots with the police because there was a meeting which was called by local police, after there was a fear that the police houses were going to be burned.  They were saying we were in cahoots with the police.  The second one is, they wanted to stay as Kuma Youth Congress because those days we spoke of South African Youth Congress, they don't want to take part in those.  Even during the transformation</p>

<p class="line" id="line3089"><a name="pos3089"></a>194</p>
<p class="line" id="line3090"><a name="pos3090"></a>period, they didn't agree to be amalgamated in the ANC Youth League and in that way they were able to disrupt our meetings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3091"><a name="pos3091"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Was there a reason why they did not want to be amalgamated with your organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3092"><a name="pos3092"></a><span class="speaker">MR POPANE:</span> There was no reason, but they were saying that they want to stay as Kuma Youth Congress.  They want to get their own freedom by burning, they want to gain their liberation by atrocities and in that way it was not the good position.  The circumstances have changed which didn't allow those things to happen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3093"><a name="pos3093"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> So in fact your organisation prevented the houses of the police would be burned?</p>

<p class="line" id="line3099"><a name="pos3099"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Would they have been entitled to think that you were in cahoots with the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3100"><a name="pos3100"></a><span class="speaker">MR POPANE:</span> As the local people and the local policemen met to discuss about the fear for destruction of their houses, that may be the reason because they see us meeting with the police to prevent the houses not to be burned. They had problems by seeing us together with the police to discuss that issue.  Maybe that is the reason they called us sell-outs.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3106"><a name="pos3106"></a><span class="speaker">MR ?:</span> Chairperson this was the end of the list of applicants, however, I have the intention of calling witnesses in this matter.  I have organised that witnesses should attend.  Mary Agnes, whose name is featuring prominently and Norma Zotsha Balani. Chairperson I've got the information that as Members of Parliament, they left Mmabatho and they were on their way to this meeting when I enquired.  I submit however, that I don't see them here and I will presume that they haven't arrived.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3107"><a name="pos3107"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> So what do you propose doing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3108"><a name="pos3108"></a><span class="speaker">MR ?:</span> Chairperson I'll propose an adjournment for these witnesses early in the morning of tomorrow.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3109"><a name="pos3109"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Mr Mpshe, do you propose calling any witnesses?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3110"><a name="pos3110"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Mr Chairperson, at this moment, I do not have witnesses to call Mr Chairperson. However, I will submit to the Chair a document from the Investigative Unit as to how unsuccessful they've been with tracing their witnesses. Mr Chairperson what I'm going to say now may also take care of our late starting after lunch.  I have been in contact with the captain of the police, Captain Fleming, during lunch time I went to the police station to find out if these people cannot be traced in Klerksdorp and he promised that if we adjourn earlier than I can drive with him to Klerksdorp to go and look for these people.  I can only be in a position to tell tomorrow whether we've found them or not.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3134"><a name="pos3134"></a>Agnes Kunwana will give her evidence in Sotho or Tswana.  May she be sworn in please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3135"><a name="pos3135"></a><span class="speaker">MARY AGNES KUNWANA:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line3136"><a name="pos3136"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Thank you Chairperson.  For record purposes, Mrs Mary Agnes Kunwana is presently serving in the North West Provincial Government Parliament as a member of parliament and the steering committee of health for the North West Province. Mrs Agnes I wish to appreciate your coming to this meeting despite within the short space of time, we appreciate your being here.  The reason for you being called to give evidence is because we have three applicants this morning who led evidence and who in their evidence have featured your name prominently as the person who was involved at the time, that at the time of their act, they have now are asking this Committee to grant amnesty on.  They were housed at your place and the three are, Mr Musiwa Mishek Popane.  We have Sindisiwe Gcinisizwe.  We have Patrick Mukontwana.  Maybe we should start it as follows.  These three applicants do you know them well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3137"><a name="pos3137"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KUNWANA:</span> Yes I know them very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3138"><a name="pos3138"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> How do you know them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3139"><a name="pos3139"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KUNWANA:</span> We used to belong to the same organisation, ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3140"><a name="pos3140"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> And is it true that at some stage during the period of 1990, they were in fact staying at your house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3141"><a name="pos3141"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KUNWANA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3142"><a name="pos3142"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Can you please give reasons why they were staying at your house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3143"><a name="pos3143"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KUNWANA:</span> Thank you. In 1990 the ANC Youth League was not yet known as ANC Youth League.  It was named according to the township where the people used to stay.  So our ANC</p>
<p class="line" id="line3144"><a name="pos3144"></a>3B.	Youth/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line3145"><a name="pos3145"></a>198</p>
<p class="line" id="line3146"><a name="pos3146"></a>Youth League  was KUYUCO and all these boys, that is the vigilantes and the ANC Youth League belonged to the same camp. They were all ANC members.  And unfortunately </p>
<p class="line" id="line3147"><a name="pos3147"></a>the police infiltrated our organisation.  That is Mr de Kock, Pretorius, and Vermaak. They divided the organisation into two.  The other group was the ANC Youth League, and the other group was KUYUCO and the KUYUCO was the one which was bribed by the police. So the police used these boys left and right.  They gave them weapons, they gave them drugs, they gave them marijuana, they gave them liquor and they used their leader's house as the office and the police provided them with a telephone, so that they could phone and inform them.  And they used to make it a point that people in that house were as comfortable as possible.  Every day in the afternoon there was a house which was burned, which was burned on the 16th of June by the youth in our community, which was occupied by one of the police who was also one of the chief movers, who wanted to see us all dead because they did not want the ANC.  They used to dump food there and everything and these boys would smoke their drugs and from there they would go hunting for the ANC Youth League.  They used to chop them with axes, they used to attempt to shoot them.  It was terrible. It was youth against youth. It was Black against Black.  And when we called the police, the police used to protect them. They would teargas the Youth League so that these people could get a chance of doing whatever they wanted to do.  And as a result, all these boys, the Youth League, the ANC Womens' League, Civic Associations, COSATU, SACP, every organisation, used to stay in my house because whenever we went out we used to be beaten up.  When we go to work we used to go in groups.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line3148"><a name="pos3148"></a>3B.	When/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line3149"><a name="pos3149"></a>198</p>
<p class="line" id="line3150"><a name="pos3150"></a>When the children go to school, they used to go in groups. That's the life we used to live.  And every five minutes I was in jail, I was arrested by de Kock and he would tell me that INKATHA is going to burn my house and all those boys who are staying there will all die. But he never made it to that. So to come to the short story of the whole thing, why this boy was murdered.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3151"><a name="pos3151"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Let me interrupt you for a while before we come to that one. Would you now say that your house was being used as some sort of a refuge for these boys that you are talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3152"><a name="pos3152"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KUNWANA:</span> Yes, they used to call it Khoto house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3153"><a name="pos3153"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Now in your testimony, you made mention of the Youth League boys and the vigilantes and then you further said this KUYOC. Who were these vigilantes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3154"><a name="pos3154"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KUNWANA:</span> We used to call them vigilantes because they broke off from our organisation and they started being vigilantes.  They started fighting us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3155"><a name="pos3155"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Do you know who were in the leadership of this vigilante group that you are mentioning now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3156"><a name="pos3156"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KUNWANA:</span> One of them was the late, his name was, I forgot his name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3157"><a name="pos3157"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Does the name Abednego Mzimeni Mazwi ring bell to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3158"><a name="pos3158"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KUNWANA:</span> That is the right name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3159"><a name="pos3159"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Thank you, you can proceed then cutting the long story short.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3160"><a name="pos3160"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KUNWANA:</span> On the said date, we were all assembled in the house and we had different meetings.  We were trying to strategise how we could combat this enemy which is fighting us.  Fortunately, whenever the ANC Youth met, we used to</p>
<p class="line" id="line3161"><a name="pos3161"></a>3B.	have/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line3162"><a name="pos3162"></a>199</p>
<p class="line" id="line3163"><a name="pos3163"></a>have some people who stand outside to watch for the enemy so that we could be able to combat the enemy when it comes.  And as they were standing outside, this very Mazwi with his group, they were in a taxi and unfortunate for them, a second house from my house, it's a spot.  So the mine people used to drink there.  So they realised that they will not be able to land the bomb which they had, which they were going to use to explode the house, and I understand it was a dynamite. So realising that they would not be able to reach the house, they threw the dynamite out.  So the boys who were standing outside, they thought that it was a cricket, so they ran to extinguish the cricket, and the mine people warned them and said, run away, that is a dynamite. It went, I understand it burned until it came to where it should explode. It exploded and fortunately where we were was not affected.  It was only the houses next to the place where we were and the electric house, which exploded.  But it was not a dangerous explosion because they say dynamite cannot explode that fiercely if it is not put under a rock or something.  So after it had exploded the youth was very cross. They went and hijacked the taxis and the people from the mine assisted them.  They went all into the taxis to look for these boys so that they could revenge for what thy had done.  Unfortunately they could not find them on that night.  They came back to the house and they slept and in the morning they woke up without anybody seeing to stop them to do what they wanted to do.  They went to Mazwi's place and they found him. They pulled him out of the house to the taxi rank and at the taxi rank this boy was killed by the whole community.  Everybody came with sticks, with stones, with everything on him and other people actually identified </p>

<p class="line" id="line3165"><a name="pos3165"></a>200</p>
<p class="line" id="line3166"><a name="pos3166"></a>their clothes on him.  Somebody said, these are my shoes and somebody said, this is my jacket, somebody said, this is my trousers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3167"><a name="pos3167"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Thank you.  To clear up something.  You talk of people who used to stand outside and watch the enemy.  I</p>
<p class="line" id="line3168"><a name="pos3168"></a>want to assume that you are referring to the marshals, isn't it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3169"><a name="pos3169"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KUNWANA:</span> Ja, definitely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3170"><a name="pos3170"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> If I may ask you in a nutshell, sort of, I believe that will bring it clarity.  If, what was the political set-up at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3171"><a name="pos3171"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KUNWANA:</span> It was very volatile. We could not move and unfortunately the police could do anything they wanted to do with us and the press could not report.  There was no press reportings.  We were tortured by the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3172"><a name="pos3172"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3173"><a name="pos3173"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mrs Kunwana, you testified that these boys were given, that is the vigilantes, they were given drugs and weapons and even a telephone was installed and the leader's house was used as an office, who is this leader?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3174"><a name="pos3174"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KUNWANA:</span> It was his home, the very same Mazwi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3175"><a name="pos3175"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> The deceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3176"><a name="pos3176"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KUNWANA:</span> Ja the deceased.     It was his home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3177"><a name="pos3177"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Was a telephone installed in his home?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3178"><a name="pos3178"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KUNWANA:</span> In his home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3179"><a name="pos3179"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> How many marshals stayed in your house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3180"><a name="pos3180"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KUNWANA:</span> Whew, I don't know.  I never counted them, who were many.  I say it was ANC Youth League, ANC Mother Body, SACP, COSATU, name it, Civic Association, ANC Womens' League, everybody stayed there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3181"><a name="pos3181"></a>3B.	MR MPSHE:/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line3182"><a name="pos3182"></a>201</p>
<p class="line" id="line3183"><a name="pos3183"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> You certainly had a big house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3184"><a name="pos3184"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KUNWANA:</span> Ja it's a big house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3185"><a name="pos3185"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Ms Kunwana, were any efforts taken by yourself, by yourself I mean the organisation and all its alliances, towards stopping the killings or addressing this a</p>
<p class="line" id="line3186"><a name="pos3186"></a>...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line3187"><a name="pos3187"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KUNWANA:</span> Ja a lot of efforts were done. We reported first to our local police. Koekemoer was in charge that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3188"><a name="pos3188"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Was he....</p>
<p class="line" id="line3189"><a name="pos3189"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KUNWANA:</span> Was in charge of the local police station.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3190"><a name="pos3190"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> When you say Koekemoer was in charge do you mean ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line3191"><a name="pos3191"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KUNWANA:</span> Of the local police station, the Kuma police station. He was the station commander.  We reported to him. Seeing that he did nothing, in fact he played innocent, he played it very cool because he was aware that he was in the township.  Anything could happen to him.  We reported to the Klerksdorp police station. We reported to the Stilfontein police station. We reported to Potchefstroom which is the headquarters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3192"><a name="pos3192"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Do you perhaps know to whom did you report at  these other police stations? If you remember the names of the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3193"><a name="pos3193"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KUNWANA:</span> Not the names.  We always reported to the senior man. We reported to the station commander in Stilfontein, station commander, to the captain in Klerksdorp. We reported to the captain in Potchefstroom, we had meetings with them. We had daily meetings with them, trying to beg them to help us but nothing happened. We went to the Lawyers of Human Rights for assistance.  They tried</p>
<p class="line" id="line3194"><a name="pos3194"></a>3B.	to/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line3195"><a name="pos3195"></a>202</p>
<p class="line" id="line3196"><a name="pos3196"></a>to mediate for us, in vain. We reported to our regional office, the ANC office, we went to report there for assistance.  Well they were also victims, they could not help us.  They said they would also be sjamboked and anything could be done to them.  We just reported for.  We reported to ANC Headquarters in Johannesburg.  We went there several times for assistance.  They used to talk to us.  We reported to the Youth League nationally.  They came, we held meetings with them.  We had meetings with the police.  The police would pretend that they understand but as soon as the leadership goes away the whole thing starts off again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3197"><a name="pos3197"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Now at all these meetings, as you say you had meetings with the police and the Youth Leagues, were the vigilantes also represented at the meetings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3198"><a name="pos3198"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KUNWANA:</span> Yes they were.  And during the meetings they were angels.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3199"><a name="pos3199"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> They were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3200"><a name="pos3200"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KUNWANA:</span> Angels.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3201"><a name="pos3201"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Oh.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3202"><a name="pos3202"></a>(Tape 3B ends)- (Tape 4A commences)</p>
<p class="line" id="line3203"><a name="pos3203"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Was the deceased Mzimeni one of the angels in the meetings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3204"><a name="pos3204"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KUNWANA:</span> We even went to the extent of making him one of the chairpersons for the meetings and on one occasion we made him a secretary so that we show him that we recognise him, but all that was in vain.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3205"><a name="pos3205"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Now you testified that there was police  involvement with the vigilantes.  Now I want to ask you, how did you perceive the involvement of the police with these vigilantes?  What came into your mind?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3206"><a name="pos3206"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KUNWANA:</span> We knew that as ANC we were not wanted.  What 4A.	came/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line3207"><a name="pos3207"></a>202</p>
<p class="line" id="line3208"><a name="pos3208"></a>came into our minds is that they want to destroy us, and destroy ANC. That's what came into our minds and we were prepared to protect our organisation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3209"><a name="pos3209"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Would you say you perhaps perceived the police as carrying out a mandate for some form of authority by getting involved with the vigilantes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3210"><a name="pos3210"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KUNWANA:</span> Well the authority which was de Kock was also involved in the whole thing. De Kock, we perceived him as the highest authority of the police and fortunately the high ranks are the people who used to come to harass us and the other police at the bottom used to follow.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3211"><a name="pos3211"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KUNWANA:</span> Do you perhaps know de Kock's rank?  What was his rank then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3212"><a name="pos3212"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KUNWANA:</span> Aye I forgot but he was lieutenant or something, I don't know these ranks, he was something.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3213"><a name="pos3213"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Mrs Kunwana, as you had numerous meetings with the police, perhaps de Kock also included, would you say de Kock was acting on his own or would you say he was also carrying out instructions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3214"><a name="pos3214"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KUNWANA:</span> Well I don't know whether he was carrying out instructions or not but all I know is that de Kock used to be the one who used to harass us, me especially. After the meetings he would come during the night and beat me thoroughly, thoroughly, he would beat me. On one occasion he broke the upper flank of my pelvis, on one occasion he broke my ribs.  The very same de Kock.  He used to beat me that the other police would say, "man wag man, dies 'n vroumens".</p>
<p class="line" id="line3215"><a name="pos3215"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Now for these beatings, numerous beatings on you, did you ever lay charges?</p>

<p class="line" id="line3220"><a name="pos3220"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Now perhaps this may be too simple a question for me to ask you, but I think it has to be asked.  What do you think the reason was for the vigilantes for targeting</p>
<p class="line" id="line3221"><a name="pos3221"></a>the ANC activists?  What was the reason? </p>
<p class="line" id="line3222"><a name="pos3222"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KUNWANA:</span> They did not want us to take power.  They realised, in fact the vigilantes were used. They didn't know what they were doing.  Up to today they are still unconscious, I'm sure, where they are, because they don't know what they were doing.  The police were using them and the police were afraid that we are going to take power. Which indeed we took.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3223"><a name="pos3223"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Now you testified further that every five minutes you were arrested or detained.  Were you ever charged?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3224"><a name="pos3224"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KUNWANA:</span> Not even once.  I was taken to jail and out without even appearing to court.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3225"><a name="pos3225"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Were you ever told why you were arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3226"><a name="pos3226"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KUNWANA:</span> All they used to say to me, look, you are a professional woman, you've got your status, what do you want in these things?  Why don't you leave these people?  Why don't you go and work and leave these people?  You've got your everything but you keep on running after these people, what do you want from them? And I told them that I want freedom. I want to be liberated.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3263"><a name="pos3263"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Mrs Balani, the reason we decided to call you here is the incident that was being recalled in this meeting was what was happening during the period of 1990 at a township called Kuma, near Stilfontein.  We were informed through the evidence by the applicants, three applicants before the Committee this morning that in a attempt to defuse the situation as was existing at the time in Kuma between the youth groups a meeting was at some time held at the offices of Lawyers for Human Rights and at the time, as an employee of Lawyers for Human Rights, you interviewed and you facilitated in fact the meeting between the two groupings.  Chairperson, I did not put it on record, the credentials of Mrs Balani, she's the member of the North West Legislature as well, Chairperson of the Agenda Committee and in the Standing Committee of the Health, in</p>

<p class="line" id="line3265"><a name="pos3265"></a>206</p>
<p class="line" id="line3266"><a name="pos3266"></a>the Legislature.  Now Mrs Balani, do you recall these instances?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3267"><a name="pos3267"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BALANI:</span> Yes I do remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3268"><a name="pos3268"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Which were these groupings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3269"><a name="pos3269"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BALANI:</span> These groupings there were two, as the lady has just said, some belonged to KUYOC, some they were ANC Youth League. There were quite conflicts between them and thus they came to our office for Lawyers For Human rights seeking help, and we tried to reconcile the two groups due to the tension.  We tried to maintain peace and understanding of development of the organisation, that it's no longer Youth Congress, it's an ANC. We tried to make them understand that, and thereafter the two groups reconciled and then there was peace. On the first day, in the first peace call and thereafter it showed that peace did not prevail again.  Another meeting was called again, it was in Kuma.  We went to that meeting and there still it was tried to reconcile these two groups and there were discussions held. There it seemed as well that there was reconciliation, only found out that it didn't.  The third meeting that I attended, was at night in a creche. It was the very same two groupings.  We tried again to talk to them.  I remember very well there was somebody from the national office of the Youth League and yet they seemed to be reconciling but yet there was no reconciliation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3270"><a name="pos3270"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Mention has been made here that on the other group we had people that go by the name of Mzimeni Mazwi.  Do you know this person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3271"><a name="pos3271"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BALANI:</span> Yes I do.  He was a leader of the other group, which was calling itself KUYOC.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3275"><a name="pos3275"></a>office of Lawyers for Human Rights, was he part of these meetings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3276"><a name="pos3276"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BALANI:</span> Yes he was a part of all these meetings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3277"><a name="pos3277"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3278"><a name="pos3278"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> What was the difference between these two groups?  What was the political difference between these two MRS BALANI:   What I think happened between these two groups was the fact that a third force involved in these groups, because there was no difference politically, they all called themselves ANC members, but outside the meetings there were these conflicts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3279"><a name="pos3279"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> You talked about this third force. Was it ever identified as to which was the third force?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3280"><a name="pos3280"></a><span class="speaker">MRS BALANI:</span> It was very difficult to identify the third force at that time because people were being used and people were not being aware of the fact that they were being used, so therefore it was not easy to identify it but as an activist at that time I did realise that there is a force involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3281"><a name="pos3281"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Yes.  Mr Mpshe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3282"><a name="pos3282"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MPSHE:</span> No questions Mr Chairman, thank you.</p>

Do you foresee that they could contribute anything on the merits of this case or would they be called as victims and couldn't they be referred for further investigation to the other committees?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3294"><a name="pos3294"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Mr Chairperson and members of the Committee, some of them will just be called as victims but Charles Mhlambiso on whom attempted murder was made may contribute something different to this Committee.  Even the woman who was in the house when the deceased was apprehended.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3295"><a name="pos3295"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> You would be unable Mr Mpshe to tell us until you have consulted with them?</p>

<p class="line" id="line3465"><a name="pos3465"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Mr Chairman, members of the Committee, one of the reasons why it was decided between the two of them that the mother should testify is that the father did not stay at home.  He was coming home fortnightly.  He was working somewhere in Johannesburg.  So he never stayed with the deceased.  He knows nothing about the deceased's activities.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3471"><a name="pos3471"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Mr Van Straaten, you were born on the 5th of March 1958 in Rustenburg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3472"><a name="pos3472"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3473"><a name="pos3473"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Will you tell the commission about your childhood, where you grew up, also about your parents and your brothers?   You were nine children, tell us how you fit into this family situation, the whole, where you fit into the nine children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3474"><a name="pos3474"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> I was born in Rustenburg, I am the third eldest son of seven brothers, and also the fourth oldest child of nine.   We lived in Rustenburg for about three years and then we moved to Vereeniging.   I lived there throughout my childhood and went to school there also.   I finished primary school there.   I grew up in a very conservative way, my father was, amongst others, a member of the Ossewa Brandwag.   I then went to secondary school.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3475"><a name="pos3475"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> May I interrupt you?   You say your father was a member of the Ossewa Brandwag.   What influence did this have on your education and your childhood, in what way did he communicate this to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3476"><a name="pos3476"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> My father taught us that things are right or wrong and that black people should be subjects and slaves, they should be used as labourers.   During that time, I saw many times how black people were attacked and beaten, I never knew why.   As I grew up in our area, there was also a nine o'clock curfew, after which black people were not allowed in the area.   There were patrol vehicles who took people away off the streets who did not obey the curfew, they simply took them away, beat them up, and this is the kind of context in which I grew up.   I then went to</p>

<p class="line" id="line3479"><a name="pos3479"></a>secondary school, and I continued in a similar vein.   Many of the places where I went, such as shops, shopping centres or malls, cafes, if there were black people, then we simply followed this tradition and also beat people up.   I never knew what the reasons for this was, this was simply the way things were, we grew up in this way and this is how things went.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3480"><a name="pos3480"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Did you have a close relationship or a poor relationship with your father?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3481"><a name="pos3481"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> As I said, we had a very strong relationship with our father, it was also a very strict relationship, things had to be right, you simply did a thing the right way or you did not do it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3482"><a name="pos3482"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Then your father died, how old were you when this happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3483"><a name="pos3483"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> I was ten years old when my father died.  I missed my father, and the things which I remembered and which I learnt from him remained with me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3484"><a name="pos3484"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> What happened after your father's death, did you stay in Vereeniging?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3485"><a name="pos3485"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> Yes, we stayed in Vereeniging, I went to secondary school.   This was a very difficult time, because I missed my father a great deal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3486"><a name="pos3486"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Then your mother married again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3487"><a name="pos3487"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> This is true, she married again.   We never accepted my new father.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3488"><a name="pos3488"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> When your mother married again, these values of your father, was this continued in the context of the new family situation, or what was the approach then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3489"><a name="pos3489"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> To some extent this was the case, that the same values continued, but not to the same extent as my</p>

<p class="line" id="line3492"><a name="pos3492"></a>father, my father was very strict, he simply said a thing once.   My stepfather rather preferred just beating one up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3493"><a name="pos3493"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> What was the political view of your stepfather, did he also communicate to you as a child, did he teach you any political views, or in what way did you experience his political principles?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3494"><a name="pos3494"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> My stepfather differed a great deal from my own father.   He did not attempt, in the same strict manner, to communicate his political values to us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3495"><a name="pos3495"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> You've already testified that the years you spent at secondary school was very difficult.   What secondary school did you attend?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3496"><a name="pos3496"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> I went to the Higher Technical School in Vereeniging.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3497"><a name="pos3497"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> You've testified that these were difficult</p>
<p class="line" id="line3498"><a name="pos3498"></a>years.   Why do you consider these years to have been difficult? </p>
<p class="line" id="line3499"><a name="pos3499"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> We were very poor, we grew up very poor.  As a young man, I never knew what I wanted or what the reasons were for all the various meaningless fights.   In standard eight I wanted to leave school to join the military.  I applied, I was accepted and I went into the army.   I was there for two weeks, but then I was informed that I was not old enough to be in the army, I wasn't 16 years old yet.   I then returned to school.    I completed standard nine and ten, and then started working at Owen and Chapman in Vereeniging.   I started working as an apprentice kettle maker.   I worked there for about six months, when I was called up for National Service.   I was called up to 8 SAI in Upington, which when I arrived there, in July 1979 I arrived there and started with my basic training.   I</p>

<p class="line" id="line3501"><a name="pos3501"></a>219	A VAN STRAATEN</p>
<p class="line" id="line3502"><a name="pos3502"></a>completed my basic training after about five months and I was then transferred to Kimberley, where I followed a subsequent course in information, as well as a driver's course.   After completion of these courses, I was transferred to Second South African Battalion in Walvis Bay.  Upon arrival there, we received further information and training and we were then sent to Chavello(?), where we received a further four weeks of training in bush war, camouflage, etcetera.   From Chavello, we went to Poha(?) in the Kakoaland.   That was our zero base where we received instructions, received our provisions and then went to the base we were to man.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3503"><a name="pos3503"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> You said that you received instructions and training.   This instruction and training that you received, what was its nature, what kind of training and instructions were these?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3504"><a name="pos3504"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> This had to do with small weapons handling, such as carabans(?), hand grenades and the various kinds of hand arms, as well as mortar training, and sometimes this was only given to certain persons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3505"><a name="pos3505"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> What kind of instructions did you receive?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3506"><a name="pos3506"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> We were already in Ojavelo(?) at the time and in that area the enemy was normally black people.   It was difficult to believe this, because in the time in which I trained, they told us we would only fight Cubans and Portuguese in the area of Angola and the other states in that area involved in that particular war.   We then went to the base we were to man.   Upon arrival there, we built the base, took our positions and we went out daily on patrol.   We went on these patrols throughout the area we manned and we learnt that without information from the people, we had</p>

<p class="line" id="line3509"><a name="pos3509"></a>to use violence to gain information.   This is how the situation continued.   It was fairly quiet in the Kaokoalands at that time.   We mainly took out landmines, disarmed landmines, and such people as happened to be in trouble, people for instance who hurt themselves in the mountains.   </p>
<p class="line" id="line3510"><a name="pos3510"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> With regard to background, I can understand to some extent that your testimony is being guided to indicate what the person's attitude was.   With regard to the detail of that which happened through the course of years, insofar as it does not have implication on this particular deed, we would appreciate it if you could use your discretion to try and prevent this from running too long, so that we can get to the actual facts.   For how long were you on the border?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3511"><a name="pos3511"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> At that time I was about 3 1/2  months on the border.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3512"><a name="pos3512"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> How long were you on the border in all and when did you clear out from the army?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3513"><a name="pos3513"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> After this period, 4 1/2  months in Ovamboland, subsequent to the time in the Kaokoa fields and then I returned and then we went back to the border for an additional four months, so all in all I spent about 18 months on the border.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3514"><a name="pos3514"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> At the end of that time you were then cleared out from service?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3515"><a name="pos3515"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> Yes, that was June 1981.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3516"><a name="pos3516"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Could you briefly tell the commission how you experienced your years in the military, what did you take out of this experience?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3517"><a name="pos3517"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> I experienced my military years as traumatic, of my friends died under these circumstances, I</p>

<p class="line" id="line3519"><a name="pos3519"></a>220	A VAN STRAATEN</p>
<p class="line" id="line3520"><a name="pos3520"></a>was often involved in contact situations.   During this time, I saw people shot or in one or another way hurt on a daily basis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3521"><a name="pos3521"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> After leaving the military, where did you go, did you return to the Republic?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3522"><a name="pos3522"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> Yes, I returned to the Republic and I then returned to Vereeniging.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3523"><a name="pos3523"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> What did you do in Vereeniging?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3524"><a name="pos3524"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> I returned to work in the Vereeniging area.   After about 13 months I was called up again to the Vereeniging Kommando, where we continued with patrols and guard duty at various large places.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3525"><a name="pos3525"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> What kind of work did you do during this time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3526"><a name="pos3526"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> I was an apprentice kettle maker.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3527"><a name="pos3527"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Upon your return from the border, with regard to your political ties, what would that have been upon your return, did you join a political party or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3528"><a name="pos3528"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> I did not join a political party at that time.   Roughly at 1985, I moved to Edenvale.   I then did not get involved, but agreed strongly with the points of view of the AWB and their actions, so I attended their meetings, and that's as far as my political involvement went.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3529"><a name="pos3529"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> If you said that you agreed with the AWB, what of that which they said did you agree with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3530"><a name="pos3530"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> I agreed with the notion of Afrikaans schools, own Afrikaans schools, self-determination, and what I mean by self-determination is that white people should be on their own.   At that time I did not agree with the mixing of races and so forth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3531"><a name="pos3531"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Was this a position that you believed in or</p>

<p class="line" id="line3533"><a name="pos3533"></a>221	A VAN STRAATEN</p>
<p class="line" id="line3534"><a name="pos3534"></a>did you not believe in this position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3535"><a name="pos3535"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> It's not that I did not believe in this position, but this is how I grew up, my feelings never changed all along.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3536"><a name="pos3536"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> So roughly in 1984 you went to Edenvale.   Between 1984 and 1989, were you continually a supporter of the AWB or involved with the AWB, and how strongly were you involved during those years?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3537"><a name="pos3537"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> I then met a friend, Robbie Coetzee, who was an AWB member.   I often went with him, he invited me to join him and my involvement increased during this time.   Because of circumstances, I could not join the AWB.   They wanted me to gain explosives for him, but this was against my principles.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3538"><a name="pos3538"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> You said that you worked at a factory.   If you did not work at this particular factory, would you have joined the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3539"><a name="pos3539"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> Yes, I would have, but my involvement would then certainly have gone further than it in fact did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3540"><a name="pos3540"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> You said that this Robbie Coetzee took you along to place, or you joined him on certain events.   Where did you go and what did you do at these particular events?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3541"><a name="pos3541"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> I went with him to meetings, and at a certain point he wanted us to go to a petrol depot at the Germiston/Alberton border to blow it up, but I refused to do this because I was not a member of the particular organisation or any other organisation at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3542"><a name="pos3542"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> How did it come that in 1989 you went to your brothers with a plan, what exactly was the run-up to this particular event?</p>

<p class="line" id="line3546"><a name="pos3546"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Who was this person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3547"><a name="pos3547"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> This is Robbie Coetzee.   Robbie Coetzee then said to me that I should make some plan and that I should start an underground cell of some kind which would then allow me to continue to create amok or to do things which would in some way help to overthrow government or at least take away the attention of government from certain events.   I then went to my brothers on the evening of the 17th of June, and I told them of this plan that I had, possibly to take over some place or to do some damage to some or other place.   We then decided to look at a particular place where there were also night guards.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3548"><a name="pos3548"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Was this a particular place, or did you just decide to go and look at a range of particular properties?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3549"><a name="pos3549"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> No, we decided in particular to go and look at a number of specific places.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3550"><a name="pos3550"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> With regard to the cell that you were supposed to found, could you give us some clearer indication of the purposes of this organisation or cell, what particularly would your purposes have been?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3551"><a name="pos3551"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> To take any particular soft targets or government targets and to destroy these, or even only to damage these.   In this way we could have gained the trust of someone and then later on could have had larger operations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3552"><a name="pos3552"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Who were these people whom you wanted to gain the trust of?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3553"><a name="pos3553"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> As Robbie Coetzee had told me and with regard to his own plans, with which I was never closely involved in, but from what I heard, I did not agree with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3554"><a name="pos3554"></a>1/	QUESTION:/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line3555"><a name="pos3555"></a>223	A VAN STRAATEN</p>
<p class="line" id="line3556"><a name="pos3556"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Was Robbie Coetzee a member of the AWB, or what was his involvement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3557"><a name="pos3557"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> As far as I know, he was a member of the AWB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3558"><a name="pos3558"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> According to you, you then, in June 1989 you went to your brothers and told them about your plan.   Could you continue from there, what then happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3559"><a name="pos3559"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> I told them of this plan.   We went into my vehicle and we drove to a couple of properties.   The particular property of Terblanche Transport was the third property past which we drove.   I saw the night watchman there.   The property was not clearly secured, there was only a chain which served as a gate.   The first thought that came to my mind was that it would be easy to gain entrance to the property.   We drove somewhat past, left the vehicle there and then decided that Willem and Dawid would first enter the property, with the purpose of tackling the night watchman and tying him up.   Gideon and myself then entered the property after them.   Upon entering the property, I saw that there were two night watchmen.   The moment we came next to them, Willem and Dawid each grabbed a night watchman.   I then knocked them over the head with a flashlight.   I then told Dawid and Gideon to go and see whether there were any ropes in the property with which we could tie up the night watchmen.   They came back and I then gave them instructions to guard the night watchmen.   Willem had already moved into the property by that time.   I moved deeper into the property and then found him at one of the trucks there.   He then told me that this particular truck is right in front of the gate, and that it would be easy for us to remove this particular vehicle.   We began</p>
<p class="line" id="line3560"><a name="pos3560"></a>1/	opening/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line3561"><a name="pos3561"></a>224	A VAN STRAATEN</p>
<p class="line" id="line3562"><a name="pos3562"></a>opening up the vehicle and to prepare to remove it from the property.   While we were busy, I heard a noise, and I told Willem that I would go and see what was happening.    At the place where I left David with the one night watchman, I saw that he and the night watchman were struggling.   I approached and kicked against something on the ground, which I then picked up and it was the particular, an axe or whatever, with which I attacked the night watchman.   I then gave the chisel to Dawid and told him to look after the night watchman.   He then told me that he couldn't find any ropes, and I then told him to see to it that the night watchman would not get up again.   I returned to the vehicle, where I told Willem that one of the night watchman were now hurt with the chisel.  I told him that we would have to hurry up to remove the vehicle so that we could get away from this particular property.   He then started up the truck.   I returned to Dawid and told him to collect Gideon and open the gate so that we could leave the property with the truck.   He went to Gideon and told Gideon to get into the truck with Willem.  Dawid then took the chain which served as a gate, he opened that up, Willem and Gideon then left the property with the truck.   Dawid and I went in the opposite direction around the block and moved back to my own car.   We got into the car and picked up Willem and Gideon where they had left the truck.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3563"><a name="pos3563"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Did you find them at the truck?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3564"><a name="pos3564"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> No, as we approached the truck, I saw that there was a white vehicle next to the truck, I drove past and saw neither Willem nor Gideon at the truck, so I simply drove past and drove away from the truck.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3565"><a name="pos3565"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> You said you had this particular plan which you</p>
<p class="line" id="line3566"><a name="pos3566"></a>1/	had/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line3567"><a name="pos3567"></a>224	A VAN STRAATEN</p>
<p class="line" id="line3568"><a name="pos3568"></a>had discussed with your brothers.   What was your purpose, your goal, with this plan, what would you have done, what did you want to achieve with your actions? </p>
<p class="line" id="line3569"><a name="pos3569"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> With this particular action, in which we failed, we had removed the truck and our intention was to take more than one of the trucks and then to show that the night watch people were not up to the task.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3570"><a name="pos3570"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> How would you have brought this under the attention of the owner, that these black night watchmen were not up to the task?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3571"><a name="pos3571"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> Well they would have arrived there, the night watchmen would have been tied up, which was our intention, and the trucks would have been removed off the property.   At that time there were also white people who were unemployed, and of these white people had applied for these particular positions, which they then did not get.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3572"><a name="pos3572"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> If you're saying they did not get these positions because it was given to black people, or why would you say did they not get these positions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3573"><a name="pos3573"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> That was my feeling at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3574"><a name="pos3574"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> What was your intention with the trucks?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3575"><a name="pos3575"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> The plan was to take them off the property so that it would look like theft, motor vehicle theft.   Both of the night watchmen then died and we were scared, so we simply took away the vehicle, so that it would appear to have been a robbery.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3576"><a name="pos3576"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> After this crime, what happened?   When were you arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3577"><a name="pos3577"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> About two or three weeks after this incident we were arrested, after there was a R30 000,00 amount of reward on my head.  After my arrest, they arrested</p>
<p class="line" id="line3578"><a name="pos3578"></a>1/	Dawid./...</p>

<p class="line" id="line3580"><a name="pos3580"></a>Dawid.   Gideon then brought them to my house, and they then arrested me.   The detectives then wanted to know from me where Willem was.   I told them that Willem was somewhere in Pretoria and that he had phoned me so that I could pick him up at the State Theatre.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3581"><a name="pos3581"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> You were then all arrested, you and Willem and Dawid, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3582"><a name="pos3582"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> That is correct, I was then on my way to Pretoria where I would have shown them where Willem was.   On the way there, the detectives wanted to know from me what had happened, whether we were involved in the incident and so on.   I then told them that I knew nothing about the incident and that I wanted to make this a political matter and I stayed with this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3583"><a name="pos3583"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> If you said that your matter would be political, what did you mean by this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3584"><a name="pos3584"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> I meant that the fact that I gave the instructions to my brothers, and the fact that these were black night watchmen at this property, whom we killed, that my political goals were so strong, or were very strong, and that I was against black people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3585"><a name="pos3585"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> If you said that these were your political purposes, what would your political purposes have been?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3586"><a name="pos3586"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> In view of the struggle we were involved in, the purpose was to oppose the government and to attempt to prove that we wanted self-determination, we wanted to govern ourselves.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3587"><a name="pos3587"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Just for clarification, who would the government have been at that time, in 1989?   You keep referring to the government which you wanted to oppose, why, what did the government do at that time that you disagreed with?</p>

<p class="line" id="line3590"><a name="pos3590"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> At that time it was the National Party who governed, I did not agree with their purposes, although there were votes, there was the referendum in 1982, this bore no fruits, the Afrikaner, especially right wing Afrikaners, were simply left in the cold.   The negotiations then continued without involving these people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3591"><a name="pos3591"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> You said that when you were arrested by the police, you told them that you would make this a political crime, what was their reaction to this, what did they say to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3592"><a name="pos3592"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> Both of the officials were drinking on the way, all of them simply laughed at me and told me that they would lock me up, or that they would send us to the island and that I would never see people again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3593"><a name="pos3593"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> What was this island, did he say what island?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3594"><a name="pos3594"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> He said Robben Island.   I simply told him that he could do what he wanted to and that I would keep with my statement.   Upon arrival at Pretoria, I showed them where Willem was, whom they then arrested.   We then returned to Vereeniging, but I was locked up for about two weeks, and I was unable to contact anyone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3595"><a name="pos3595"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Eventually you made a statement.   After how long did you make this confession?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3596"><a name="pos3596"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> It was about two weeks later, I then... (TAPE ENDS - WORDS MISSING - START OF SIDE B) ...after about 3 1/2  months I went out on bail, I then returned to my own home, and there, after a further month, I was able to come in contact with Robbie Coetzee.   He, however, caught fright when he saw me, he was astounded to see me.   I had a conversation with him and he played cat and mouse with me, told me not to panic, but that he would try and get hold of</p>

<p class="line" id="line3599"><a name="pos3599"></a>some legal representation for me.   The thing continued in this vein.   He then disappeared and I have never seen him or never saw him for a further six months.   One of my other friends then approached me and told me that he knew where Robbie was.   I arranged, and on a particular evening I went through, I found Robbie in Orkney where he stayed, I saw him there that evening, he again caught fright when he saw me and told me that I should not panic, but that the matter would be taken care of, and that is all that happened.  After a further two - sorry...</p>
<p class="line" id="line3600"><a name="pos3600"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Mr Chair, indeed, I will return to this to clear it up at a later stage, but the initial notion or instruction came from this Robbie Coetzee.   The events with regard to the crime, I need to clarify the role of Robbie Coetzee in this regard.    You then came into contact with Robbie, did he assist you in any way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3601"><a name="pos3601"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> No, in no way.   After about a year of this case, I never heard anything further from him.   When I next heard from him or of him, his sister-in-law told me that he died in a mine accident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3602"><a name="pos3602"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Looking back on the crime of 1989, what was the role of Robbie Coetzee in this regard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3603"><a name="pos3603"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> He tried to manipulate me and if I think about it today, he actually exploited me, he abused me and when our case came to trial, I was in the dark, I didn't know what to do, and then I made a confession in which I told what my part in the offence was, and that's where the matter stood, and we were punished according to the confession.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3608"><a name="pos3608"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON(?):</span> ...persuaded him to commit this offence, you cannot put words in his mouth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3609"><a name="pos3609"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE MALL:</span> He said he created a cell with his brothers and he told his brothers what they were going to do, Coetzee was not in it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3610"><a name="pos3610"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> I will rephrase the question.    This Robbie Coetzee, what role did he play in the initial offence of 1989?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3611"><a name="pos3611"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> As I said, he tried to use me, and he tried to make me a member of the AWB, I didn't want to become a member of the AWB, and that's where the matter ended, he just wanted to use me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3612"><a name="pos3612"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Right.   Now we come to your trial.   You say you made a confession and you stood by it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3613"><a name="pos3613"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3614"><a name="pos3614"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Can you remember, at the start of the trial did you plead guilty or not guilty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3615"><a name="pos3615"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> I made the confession and I later pleaded guilty to robbery, but not guilty of murder.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3616"><a name="pos3616"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Right.   You were then sentenced to 13 years?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3617"><a name="pos3617"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> Yes, I was sentenced to altogether 13 years imprisonment for murder and robbery.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3618"><a name="pos3618"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> You are currently in the Zonderwater Prison just outside Pretoria, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3619"><a name="pos3619"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3620"><a name="pos3620"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> And you're in Medium A section?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3621"><a name="pos3621"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3622"><a name="pos3622"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Do I understand you correctly that it is a minimum security prison, that section of the prison?</p>

<p class="line" id="line3625"><a name="pos3625"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> Yes.   Yes, we're not locked up at night, and I have progressed so far that I actually work outside the prison and that's all contributed to the changes that have taken place in my life and you must qualify to be given these privileges.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3626"><a name="pos3626"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> If you look back to 1989 and what happened then, what are your views about what happened now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3627"><a name="pos3627"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> Well, I was still very stupid then and today I realise that negotiations are the only way forward and that violence can never solve anything, and I'm very sorry about the people that died and I'm really sorry about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3628"><a name="pos3628"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> I have no further questions, chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3629"><a name="pos3629"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Mr Mpshe, any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3630"><a name="pos3630"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.   Your father, was he a member of any political organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3631"><a name="pos3631"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> As far as I can remember, he was a member of the Ossewa Brandwag.   As I said, I was about ten years old when my father died.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3632"><a name="pos3632"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Was he a leader in that movement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3633"><a name="pos3633"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> Pardon me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3634"><a name="pos3634"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Was he a leader in the movement of the Ossewa Brandwag?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3635"><a name="pos3635"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> I really don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3636"><a name="pos3636"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> The things your father taught you, such as, for instance, that black people were subservient and that they were slaves, is it correct that what was actually brought to your mind was to actually hate black people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3637"><a name="pos3637"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3638"><a name="pos3638"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> And you then decided later on to actually give expression to that hatred by committing this offence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3639"><a name="pos3639"></a>1/	MR VAN STRAATEN:/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line3640"><a name="pos3640"></a>229	A VAN STRAATEN</p>
<p class="line" id="line3641"><a name="pos3641"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> Could you repeat the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3642"><a name="pos3642"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> You later decided to give expression to your hatred through these offences?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3643"><a name="pos3643"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3644"><a name="pos3644"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> As I said, all those years you were just taught these things and it stuck in your mind?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3645"><a name="pos3645"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> I would say that this offence gave expression to these principles and the hatred we felt, and that was passed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3646"><a name="pos3646"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> You also testified that you were ten years old when your father died.   Now my question is, after your father's death, was your father's influence still felt in your life, did he still have some influence on your thinking?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3647"><a name="pos3647"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> Yes, the couple of things that I learnt from him, the things that I saw, that always stayed with me, always stayed in my mind.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3648"><a name="pos3648"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> How strong was your father's influence towards yourself, in respect of yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3649"><a name="pos3649"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> Well, as I said, he was very strict, a thing was either right or wrong, you weren't allowed to put a foot wrong, and he didn't talk much, he beat us quite easily.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3650"><a name="pos3650"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Were you later a member of any political organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3651"><a name="pos3651"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> Pardon me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3652"><a name="pos3652"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Were you a member of any political organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3653"><a name="pos3653"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> No, I was a supporter of the AWB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3654"><a name="pos3654"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Now the feelings regarding the AWB's policy, how did you reach these goals and doctrines if you weren't a member, how did you feel about it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3655"><a name="pos3655"></a>1/	MR VAN STRAATEN:/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line3656"><a name="pos3656"></a>230	A VAN STRAATEN</p>
<p class="line" id="line3657"><a name="pos3657"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> The National Party at the time negotiated quite frequently, but they never considered those people on the far right and some of the objectives pursued by the AWB were own Afrikaans schools, self-determination for white South Africans.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3658"><a name="pos3658"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> My learned friend asked you what was your objective with this offence, what did you actually want to achieve, do you remember the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3659"><a name="pos3659"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3660"><a name="pos3660"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Your answer was, to prove that the night watch people weren't competent to actually do the job.   What do you mean by that, that they were inferior people because they were black?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3661"><a name="pos3661"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> No, in that time there were also white people who couldn't find employment, but who couldn't find that kind of work.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3662"><a name="pos3662"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Do you agree then that what you did, or the motive for what you did had nothing to do with politics?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3663"><a name="pos3663"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> No, the answer which I gave was, as I said, this is the way we were raised, I went to the army, I was taught that our enemies were black people, and that is the view that I wanted to put across.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3664"><a name="pos3664"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Would it be correct if I made the statement that what you did was not as a result of an order or instruction given by any political organisation, you and your brothers, you planned this and then actually executed the plan?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3665"><a name="pos3665"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> It wasn't done on the instructions of any organisation.   This person Robbie Coetzee, who tried to influence me, he told me that I should do a thing like this and then I went to my brothers and I gave them the instruction, and I was the leader more or less in this</p>

<p class="line" id="line3669"><a name="pos3669"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> I'm going to refer you to the supplementary statement which was drafted, paragraph 19, chairperson and members, paragraph 19, page 5, page 5 of the supplementary statement, page 10 of the index.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3670"><a name="pos3670"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Mr Mpshe, you must ask somebody to index your papers so that it corresponds with ours.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3671"><a name="pos3671"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Right, I'm going to read a little bit of this, paragraph 19, it reads as follows</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line3672"><a name="pos3672"></a>"The commission of the offence was preceded by the following</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line" id="line3673"><a name="pos3673"></a>1.	During June of 1989, I approached my brothers with the idea that we should establish a cell or organisation which would operate in the PWV area."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line3674"><a name="pos3674"></a>My question is, was this cell or organisation established by yourself and your brothers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3675"><a name="pos3675"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> Yes, it was established and that was our first act which actually amounted to a failure and to an offence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3676"><a name="pos3676"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Did this organisation have a name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3677"><a name="pos3677"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> No, it didn't have a name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3678"><a name="pos3678"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Was it known to the public?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3679"><a name="pos3679"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> No, it was just established and just committed this particular act on that night, we were caught and that was it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3680"><a name="pos3680"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> In other words, yourself and your brothers, you were the members of that cell, that organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3681"><a name="pos3681"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3682"><a name="pos3682"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> I also got these copies from Cape Town, my copies are not indexed, but I'll refer to a letter which he wrote,</p>

<p class="line" id="line3685"><a name="pos3685"></a>I'm going to refer to a letter which you wrote, I don't know what page that would be, I'm going to refer you to a letter and I want you to tell me whether this is the letter that you wrote?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3686"><a name="pos3686"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Page 46, to be of assistance to you, Mr Mpshe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3687"><a name="pos3687"></a><span class="speaker">UNKNOWN SPEAKER:</span> Is that the letter dated the 2nd of October 1992?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3688"><a name="pos3688"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3689"><a name="pos3689"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> That is correct, chairperson, I wrote the letter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3690"><a name="pos3690"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> I'm reading from the second paragraph from the bottom, and it reads as follows</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line3691"><a name="pos3691"></a>"As a result of the fact that the murder was not premeditated, it just arose from pure racial hatred, and the purpose of the struggle against apartheid was aimed in such a way, the death of the two night watchmen was caused."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line3692"><a name="pos3692"></a>Did you hear that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3693"><a name="pos3693"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3694"><a name="pos3694"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Do you agree that the fact that you refer in this letter to the fact that it arose from pure racial hatred, that that once again shows that it had nothing to do with politics?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3695"><a name="pos3695"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> Well, as I understand politics, it was the way I was raised, and in my experience the various races were pitted against each other and these were the consequences.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3696"><a name="pos3696"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Thank you chairperson, no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3697"><a name="pos3697"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER:</span> Mr Van Straaten, is it not true that you took the truck and you couldn't continue with it because its brakes failed?</p>

<p class="line" id="line3699"><a name="pos3699"></a>233	A VAN STRAATEN</p>
<p class="line" id="line3700"><a name="pos3700"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> No, no, chairperson, we purposely left it behind to make it look like a robbery.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3701"><a name="pos3701"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER:</span> Well you don't know, because you weren't in the truck?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3702"><a name="pos3702"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3703"><a name="pos3703"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER:</span> During your evidence at the trial you said that the truck wouldn't move any further, that is also what one of your brothers testified?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3704"><a name="pos3704"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> You see, chairperson, if we really wanted to steal the truck, or wanted to remove it, I would have obtained a qualified driver to actually drive the truck, I would have taken such a person with me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3705"><a name="pos3705"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER:</span> If you really wanted to tie up the night watchmen, wouldn't you have taken ropes to tie them up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3706"><a name="pos3706"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3707"><a name="pos3707"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER:</span> Then why didn't you take ropes with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3708"><a name="pos3708"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> I told Dawid and Gideon that there were ropes in my vehicle and that's why they didn't take ropes with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3709"><a name="pos3709"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER:</span> But you were the leader, you wanted to go and tie the guards up and you didn't actually take ropes to do so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3710"><a name="pos3710"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3711"><a name="pos3711"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER:</span> Wasn't this just robbery of a vehicle, Mr Van Straaten?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3712"><a name="pos3712"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> No, chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3713"><a name="pos3713"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER:</span> Were you drinking that whole day, whilst you were planning the offence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3714"><a name="pos3714"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> I think I arrived at Dawid and Willem's place at about six o'clock that evening, they were sitting in the bar and they were drinking, and we did drink, but we</p>
<p class="line" id="line3715"><a name="pos3715"></a>1/	also,/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line3716"><a name="pos3716"></a>234	A VAN STRAATEN</p>
<p class="line" id="line3717"><a name="pos3717"></a>also, we still knew what we were doing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3718"><a name="pos3718"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER:</span> Yes, no, I assume that, but Dawid and Willem had been drinking since that morning when the bar opened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3719"><a name="pos3719"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> Yes, that is what I understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3720"><a name="pos3720"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER:</span> If you wanted to teach the government a lesson, why did you go to the premises of a private company and commit a theft there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3721"><a name="pos3721"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> Because they apparently transported some government goods.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3722"><a name="pos3722"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER:</span> You see, you initially said that your objective was to attack soft targets of the government?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3723"><a name="pos3723"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3724"><a name="pos3724"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER:</span> And in doing this you deviated from that objective completely, you went to a private property to attack that.   What political objective could you have been pursuing by doing this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3725"><a name="pos3725"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> Because they also transported government goods, across the country they transported various goods.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3726"><a name="pos3726"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER:</span> So would you have targeted any private person conveying state goods?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3727"><a name="pos3727"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3728"><a name="pos3728"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER:</span> Now why was this never referred to as your objective, why did you never say that, "We would have attacked anybody that conveyed goods for the state"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3729"><a name="pos3729"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> It just didn't come out like that at the trial because we were lay people and with our confession, I thought maybe I would be able to trace Robbie Coetzee and he would be able to assist us and clarify the matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3730"><a name="pos3730"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER:</span> But you testified in court, didn't you, or was it only your brother who testified?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3731"><a name="pos3731"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> Only Dawid testified.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3732"><a name="pos3732"></a>1/	MR DE JAGER:/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line3733"><a name="pos3733"></a>235	A VAN STRAATEN</p>
<p class="line" id="line3734"><a name="pos3734"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER:</span> Now why did you not testify and tell the Court that that was your objective?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3735"><a name="pos3735"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> Because the story didn't quite work out the way we wanted it to work out and I then made use of my right to silence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3736"><a name="pos3736"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER:</span> But if you'd told the Court that Robbie had told you to do this and that, it might have been in your favour, is that not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3737"><a name="pos3737"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> That's correct, but at that stage, it was before his death, I just left him out of the case completely to return to him at a later stage, so that he could perhaps help us.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3749"><a name="pos3749"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> No, did you give the order that they must be killed?   You swore in this application that that is what you'd done?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3750"><a name="pos3750"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> Yes, yes I swore that it was the truth, but at that stage we didn't actually know what was going on</p>

<p class="line" id="line3755"><a name="pos3755"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Well I don't understand this, Mr Van Straaten, 20th of February 1996, this was when this statement was made, and then you said that you gave the order, you must have known whether you did it or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3756"><a name="pos3756"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> As I told you, chairperson, at that stage I was really desperate, and that's the way I filled in the form, and I just swore that it was the truth because maybe it would have been our last chance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3757"><a name="pos3757"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> And you said that, if I understand you correctly, that you pleaded not guilty to murder an guilty to the robbery, is that correct?</p>

<p class="line" id="line3759"><a name="pos3759"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> You also filled in a form, you applied, in terms of section 18 of Act 34 of 1995, to the Amnesty Committee.  Do you know this form?</p>

<p class="line" id="line3776"><a name="pos3776"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> I don't know whether it was used on the second night watchman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3777"><a name="pos3777"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> No, no, I think I'm making a mistake there.  Thank you.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3780"><a name="pos3780"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> And I believe Mr Coetzee, Robert Coetzee, was a member of the AWB, like you said?</p>

<p class="line" id="line3782"><a name="pos3782"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> And when you committed these offences, you were not in any way committing them in your capacity as a supporter of the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3783"><a name="pos3783"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> From my point of view, with regard to the situation, he forced me, to a certain extent, to join the AWB, but I refused.   Since I agreed with some of the positions of the AWB, I saw myself as a supporter of the AWB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3784"><a name="pos3784"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> You never discussed these offences with him before you committed them?</p>

<p class="line" id="line3792"><a name="pos3792"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> No, he did not know that we were going to remove the trucks, but the next day I informed him that the two black night watchmen were dead.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3793"><a name="pos3793"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> But from your deeds, didn't he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3794"><a name="pos3794"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> That is correct, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3795"><a name="pos3795"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> That must have indicated to you that at least members of the AWB that you are in contact with, did not approve or support what you did, isn't it, because he did not even arrange legal defence for you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3796"><a name="pos3796"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> I would not say so, Mr Chair, he tried to play cat and mouse with me and said he would return to me, but then he simply disappeared.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3798"><a name="pos3798"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> That's then what we deduced, that's how the matter turned out in the way in which it did.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3800"><a name="pos3800"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> That's correct.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3807"><a name="pos3807"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> Because we grew up in this way, I can say that at that time it was difficult to accept the situation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3808"><a name="pos3808"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> In your letter of the 20th of November 1992, this letter was addressed to Mr Van der Westhuizen, and in this letter you say that racial hatred was the reason for this murder?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3809"><a name="pos3809"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> That is correct, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3810"><a name="pos3810"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> You remember that?</p>

<p class="line" id="line3812"><a name="pos3812"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> In your letter of the 9th of January 1993 to Captain Schoonbee, you said the same thing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3813"><a name="pos3813"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> That is correct, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3814"><a name="pos3814"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> In your evidence you have stated that the white people who were unemployed and could not get any position even though they had applied for employment in some of the positions, and in this case we are talking of a company which had been employing two night watchmen who were given a baton and a torch to facilitate their guarding of the premises...</p>
<p class="line" id="line3815"><a name="pos3815"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3816"><a name="pos3816"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Now, are you able to tell us of any white people who had probably approached this company in question with a view of placing themselves for employment as night watchmen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3817"><a name="pos3817"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> I don't have particular names or witnesses who could confirm this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3818"><a name="pos3818"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Do you know if there were any whites who had applied at Terblanche Transport for a position of a night watchman?</p>

<p class="line" id="line3821"><a name="pos3821"></a>239	A VAN STRAATEN</p>
<p class="line" id="line3822"><a name="pos3822"></a>I say, I cannot give you names or refer you to any witnesses in this regard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3823"><a name="pos3823"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> Now basically your purpose was that you had to do something that would unequivocally show the glaring incompetence of blacks in their positions of employment.   What I fail to understand is, what was so fundamental and unique about stealing a truck of a private concern that would have driven the message home about the incompetence of blacks in this case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3824"><a name="pos3824"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> With the fact that we would have succeeded in removing the vehicle, as I say it was not the intention to kill them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3825"><a name="pos3825"></a><span class="speaker">MS KHAMPEPE:</span> But would any of the people who had previously applied for positions, would they have been employed by the company, would you have succeeded in getting them employment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3826"><a name="pos3826"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3827"><a name="pos3827"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> Do you wish to re-examine your witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3828"><a name="pos3828"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Mr Chair, I only have two remaining questions to address to the witness.   Mr Van Straaten, if this action which you planned and carried out in June 1989, if this had happened in the way in which you'd planned, that you would have tied up the night watchmen and removed the vehicle, would this cell or organisation then have had any particular plans for the future?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3829"><a name="pos3829"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> I would then have continued possibly to register it as a political movement and I might have received further instructions from Robbie Coetzee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3830"><a name="pos3830"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Secondly, after you were imprisoned, have you had any further contact with the AWB, or did they contact you to prove their support?</p>

<p class="line" id="line3834"><a name="pos3834"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> A moment please, chair.   I have on such a Christmas wish in my possession, is this, if you look at it, one of these cards?   Mr Chair, I request permission to hand this to you.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3847"><a name="pos3847"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Mr Chair, I'm calling Willem van Straaten next, he is the eldest of the four brothers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3848"><a name="pos3848"></a><span class="speaker">WILLEM VAN STRAATEN:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line3849"><a name="pos3849"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Could you tell the commission, briefly give us the story of your childhood years, where you grew up and the relationship between yourself and your father?   You are, I believe, the second eldest of the nine children, is that the case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3850"><a name="pos3850"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> Yes.   I was born in Rustenburg, the 5th of the 3rd month of 1958.   We lived in Rustenburg until I</p>
<p class="line" id="line3851"><a name="pos3851"></a>was about five or six years old, and then we moved to Vereeniging in the Vaal Triangle.   I grew up in a home that was extremely conservative, Christians, and from a very young age it was impressed on me that black people are subjects, that our cultures are not the same.    Through the course of time, as I grew up, this impression became all the stronger.   With regard to my school years this remained the same, through primary and secondary school years.   I finished standard eight in school.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3852"><a name="pos3852"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Where did you go after school?   Where did you go after completing standard eight in school, where did you go after that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3853"><a name="pos3853"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> I worked for a year and then I went to the army for a year.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3854"><a name="pos3854"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Briefly where did you do your National Service?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3855"><a name="pos3855"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> In Pretoria, in Voortrekkerhoogte.  That was at 5 Military Works Unit.   5 Military Works Unit was like a construction unit in the army, people who built bridges and roads and that kind of thing.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3858"><a name="pos3858"></a>242	W VAN STRAATEN</p>
<p class="line" id="line3859"><a name="pos3859"></a>you get basic training?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3860"><a name="pos3860"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> Yes, we had arms training, weapons training, training for border duty and we learnt how to combat the enemy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3861"><a name="pos3861"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Who would be your enemy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3862"><a name="pos3862"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> We were taught that black people were the enemy.   I spent the last six months of my military service in Bloemfontein, and there I guarded various black prisoners who worked on the army properties.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3863"><a name="pos3863"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> On what year did you clear out from army?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3864"><a name="pos3864"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> When I did military service it was only for 12 months.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3865"><a name="pos3865"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> So in what year did you clear out from military service?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3866"><a name="pos3866"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> It was the end of 1977.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3867"><a name="pos3867"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Where did you go subsequently, what did you do after your military service?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3868"><a name="pos3868"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> I then returned to the firm where I was doing my apprenticeship as a panelbeater.   I served a five year apprenticeship at this firm, and then in 1980 I qualified as a panelbeater.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3869"><a name="pos3869"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> What did you do after this apprenticeship?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3870"><a name="pos3870"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> In 1981, because I had worked for the firm for such a long time, I went to look around at other firms, how they went about their business, just to gain a slightly different routine.   I worked for two other firms.   I was not happy at these two firms, and then I returned to the firm where I served my apprenticeship.   At this firm I remained for a number of years, and then I opened my own business.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3871"><a name="pos3871"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> In what year was this?</p>

<p class="line" id="line3874"><a name="pos3874"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> This must have been, say, the beginning of 1982.   I then had my own business from that time until October 1986.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3875"><a name="pos3875"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> What then happened to your firm in '86?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3876"><a name="pos3876"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> How would I put this?   I mismanaged the business in a careless manner and went bankrupt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3877"><a name="pos3877"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> What, at this time, would have been your political views, did you belong to any organisations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3878"><a name="pos3878"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> I was a registered member of the Conservative Party and a supporter of the AWB, but not a member of the AWB, only a supporter.</p>

<p class="line" id="line3880"><a name="pos3880"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> We continued to fight for our own volksreg, ethnic self-determination.   In my view, every person, because of our skin colour, people differed, their cultures differ, I should live in my own area and they should live in their own areas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3881"><a name="pos3881"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Would you say that the principles which you learned as a child provided the backdrop against your adult views, with regard to your political views?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3882"><a name="pos3882"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> I would say that we always used these people as slaves, the people to do the dirty work.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3883"><a name="pos3883"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Then in June 1989, your younger brother, Adriaan, came or approached you.   Could you briefly explain to the commission what he suggested to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3884"><a name="pos3884"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> On the particular evening of this incident, we were sitting around and having some drinks.   This was, I don't want to give drink the reason or why I did this, I was fully aware of what I was doing, but on this</p>

<p class="line" id="line3888"><a name="pos3888"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Did you decide there and then, as you were sitting there, to do this, to carry out this action to remove this truck?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3889"><a name="pos3889"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> Yes, to remove this truck from the particular property.   We went to this particular property, drove past the property and then we saw a single night watch behind a sort of a building which served as a guard room.   We drove past in our car and about three or four hundred metres past the property, we left the car, walked back to the property.   Arriving at the property, we saw that it had high walls and we could not see what was going on inside the property.  Dawid and I then entered the property.   Having entered the property, we noticed that there were two rather than only a single night watchman.   Dawid and I each grabbed a night watchman, held them so that Andre and Dion would be able to tie them up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3890"><a name="pos3890"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> You refer to Andre, who is Andre?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3891"><a name="pos3891"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> That is Adriaan.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3892"><a name="pos3892"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> You may continue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3893"><a name="pos3893"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> I then passed my night watchman over to Andre, entered the property to scout the property.   I walked to the truck which was standing there, looked around and decided that this would be the easiest vehicle to remove, since it was parked right across from the gate.   I looked around, walked back to the guard room, saw that there were keys hanging from a particular board, I took some of the keys and walked to the particular vehicle with these keys.   On the way to the vehicle, I saw Andre and asked him</p>

<p class="line" id="line3895"><a name="pos3895"></a>244	W VAN STRAATEN</p>
<p class="line" id="line3896"><a name="pos3896"></a>if everything was under control, if the guards were tied up, and he then told me that there was a struggle going on.   I then told him that we had to finish up so that we could continue with the removal of the truck.   I entered the vehicle, switched the vehicle on, started the vehicle, but lacking experience with the driving of trucks, I started the truck, which I had seen people do on occasion.  While the vehicle was running, I jumped out of the vehicle, out of the truck, and went to the place where the night watchmen were supposed to be tied up.   Andre and Dawid then told me that there was a struggle and that they had mistakenly knifed one night watch to death.   This upset me, because it was not our intention and we had not made an agreement to kill any of the night watchmen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3897"><a name="pos3897"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> What would you have agreed to do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3898"><a name="pos3898"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> We agreed to tie them up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3899"><a name="pos3899"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> You may continue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3900"><a name="pos3900"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> In the course of the struggle, Gideon knifed one of the night watchmen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3901"><a name="pos3901"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Let's leave the matter there, what was your further contribution, you had started the truck, what further contribution did you make with regard to this particular truck?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3902"><a name="pos3902"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> Being upset about the one night watchman, because I only knew of the one night watchman at that time, who was dead, I then said to them that we must hurry up so that we can remove this particular vehicle, since the entire matter had turned out unfortunately, as we had not planned.  I then entered the vehicle.   Dawid had opened the gate.   It wasn't actually a gate, but sort of a chain which was serving as a gate.   Gideon and I then jumped into the truck</p>

<p class="line" id="line3905"><a name="pos3905"></a>and I attempted to remove the truck from the property.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3906"><a name="pos3906"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> You say that you attempted to remove the vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3907"><a name="pos3907"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> Yes.   Since I had no experience, for instance with the brakes of the vehicle or where its various instruments are located.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3908"><a name="pos3908"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> What did you then do with this truck after removing it from the property?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3909"><a name="pos3909"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> I drove the truck out of the property, but it was difficult to get the truck to move along, it was difficult to start it up and to get it to move along.   I then drove the vehicle toward the place where we had intended to leave it, which would have been about 300 metres from the property.   We had difficulty to get the vehicle to the place where we wanted to leave it.   Andre and Dawid were then going to pick us up with the vehicle at that point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3910"><a name="pos3910"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Is this how things then went, did they come and pick you up with Adriaan's vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3911"><a name="pos3911"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> No, not immediately.   Since I then left the truck some distance from the property, I then waited for them to come and pick me up with the vehicle, but then when I looked in the reverse mirror of the vehicle, I saw unfamiliar vehicle lights behind me, which was not the lights of the vehicle which we used, of the motor car which we used, these were different lights.   It turned out to be a bakkie which had round lights rather than the square lights of our car.   I immediately noticed that this was not these people.   Gideon and myself then jumped out of the left door of the truck cabin and ran into the veld, Gideon in his own direction and I in my own direction.   Later that</p>

<p class="line" id="line3914"><a name="pos3914"></a>evening we met each other at home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3915"><a name="pos3915"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> If I can take you back to the moment when Adriaan arrived at your home that evening of the 17th with this plan which he suggested to you, what did you intend, what did you understand to have been the ultimate purpose of this action?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3916"><a name="pos3916"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> As far as I could understand it at that moment was this, the National Party continued to give in to the ANC, PAC, other such organisations, that white people kept on being fired out of their positions and black people kept on being employed.   Many of my friends who had businesses, and also myself, had been damaged because, or hurt, because of parts that were stolen from vehicles, people who broke into scrapyards and so on, even at places where night watchmen were on duty, maybe because they were sitting and sleeping, or maybe because they were drunk, but in any event people had losses because of these night watchmen, so we then decided that we would make a contribution as white people that both government and private organisations had to be shown that black people were not up to this particular kind of task.   We believed that if this happened on more occasions, they would fire black people and employ white people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3917"><a name="pos3917"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Did you understand this to be the purpose of your action?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3918"><a name="pos3918"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3919"><a name="pos3919"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Why did you agree to this action, when Adriaan came to you with this plan, why did you agree to do this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3920"><a name="pos3920"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> Being a supporter of the AWB, sharing their purposes and their objectives and believing it to have been right, and in view of the many people who had difficulties due to unemployment...</p>

<p class="line" id="line3923"><a name="pos3923"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> If you talk about "us", who are you referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3924"><a name="pos3924"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> White people, people who lost their positions, who had high positions but were fired and replaced by black people.   I thought that, from my point of view, with Adriaan's suggestion, I thought that I would be doing something for my people, and that if this were to happen more than once, or on several occasions, the consequence would be to create employment for white people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3925"><a name="pos3925"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Two weeks later you were arrested, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3926"><a name="pos3926"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3927"><a name="pos3927"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Upon your arrest, could you briefly sketch for the commission how it came about that you made the confession and what happened at your later trial, at your subsequent trial?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3928"><a name="pos3928"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> I was arrested in Pretoria.   If I remember correctly, there were four or five investigating officers, using two vehicles.   I phoned Adriaan to tell me, or to ask him that he should come and pick me up in front of the State Theatre in Pretoria.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3929"><a name="pos3929"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Is that the evening that the police picked you up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3930"><a name="pos3930"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> Yes, the evening of the arrest.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3931"><a name="pos3931"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Where did they then take you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3932"><a name="pos3932"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> We were then taken first to Vanderbijl Park Murder and Robbery Unit.   On the evening of my arrest, I had been drinking, but I was fully conscious.   We did not make any confessions or statements that evening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3933"><a name="pos3933"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Did you indicate to the police, or rather let me ask it in a different way, did the police ask you about your crime upon your arrest?</p>

<p class="line" id="line3935"><a name="pos3935"></a>247	W VAN STRAATEN</p>
<p class="line" id="line3936"><a name="pos3936"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> Yes.   After they arrested Adriaan, we were not supposed to have been together, they kept us separately, each on his own.   I was in Meyerton, Adriaan was in Vereeniging, Dawid was in Vanderbijl Park.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3937"><a name="pos3937"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Are these the police stations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3938"><a name="pos3938"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> That's correct, the police stations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3939"><a name="pos3939"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> The police then asked you why you committed this crime, or did they not ask you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3940"><a name="pos3940"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> Yes, they asked me.   The one investigating officer, whom I knew quite well, told me that he was sorry to have heard of the incident.   I then said to him, "Yes, it did not turn out in the way which we had intended."   He then asked me what our intention was with the truck.   When I told him what our purpose had been... (END OF TAPE 2A - WORDS LOST - START OF TAPE 2B)  ...arms.  Since I did not go there with arms, it was our intention only to tie them up.   On the way to Meyerton Police Station where I would have been kept under arrest, the one detective asked me, as we were driving along, and I'm not trying to say anything particularly nasty about them, but we all know that such a person being brought under arrest, that they threaten people, that they sometimes beat you up, he then asked me if this was one of my tall tales and whether I would attempt to make my case political and that I can forget about this, and his straight words were the following:  that I would have to live the rest of my life with Mandela at Robben Island, that we should play the game and tell them what exactly happened and then that we would not have a long imprisonment.   I was confused and did not know what exactly to do at that moment.   The next day, if I remember correctly, we went to the Vereeniging Police</p>

<p class="line" id="line3943"><a name="pos3943"></a>Station where we made statements.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3944"><a name="pos3944"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Would that have been before your confession?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3945"><a name="pos3945"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> No, rather it would have been a confession in front of a magistrate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3946"><a name="pos3946"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> So in 1991 you stood trial, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3947"><a name="pos3947"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3948"><a name="pos3948"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> I made a statement.   I think that in my statement I confessed that I was involved in the crime.  When we were found guilty, and we do not feel that we had a fair trial, because the Legal Aid which I had, the attorney which I wanted to obtain told me that he could not take my case, since I had already made a confession.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3949"><a name="pos3949"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> You were then found guilty at the trial, you did not bring testimony at the trial, is that correct, that's the trial of '91, May '91, you made no testimony yourself, but you were found guilty, is that the case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3950"><a name="pos3950"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> Yes.  I pleaded guilty on the crime at that time, I was confused, subsequently I pleaded not guilty on murder, guilty on robbery.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3951"><a name="pos3951"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Is that how you pleaded?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3952"><a name="pos3952"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> Indeed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3953"><a name="pos3953"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> You were then given 15 years of imprisonment, is that the case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3954"><a name="pos3954"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> Indeed, and I am at Zonderwater Prison in Medium A section.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3955"><a name="pos3955"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> When were you placed in Medium A, were you placed there directly after your imprisonment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3956"><a name="pos3956"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> No.  After having been found guilty, we were, if I remember correctly, for about two weeks in Leeuhof, and then we were put over to Zonderwater.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3957"><a name="pos3957"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> For how long were you in Zonderwater before you</p>

<p class="line" id="line3961"><a name="pos3961"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> We were at Zonderwater, or I was at Zonderwater for about 2 1/2  to three years before I was placed in the Medium A section.   This particular section where we are currently imprisoned is a minimum security section of the prison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3962"><a name="pos3962"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Looking back upon the events of 1989, what would your current view in this regard be, how do you see what happened and what you did?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3963"><a name="pos3963"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> With the passage of time, many things changed, we also changed, we changed a lot.   If one looks at how things have changed since the election...</p>
<p class="line" id="line3964"><a name="pos3964"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Which election are you referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3965"><a name="pos3965"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> The 1994 election.   If I had known then what I know now, then I wouldn't have been sitting here today.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3966"><a name="pos3966"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> May I just take you back to one aspect, so that I can clarify it with you, the evening when Adriaan came to you, the evening of 17th of June 1989, if I understand correctly from his testimony, he suggested that you establish a cell?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3967"><a name="pos3967"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> Yes, yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3968"><a name="pos3968"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> What was your understanding of how this cell would operate, how it would function, what would be its ultimate objective?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3969"><a name="pos3969"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> If we had continued with what we had been busy with, we, I think, would have targeted and attacked bigger places later on, we would have become stronger, gained more members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3970"><a name="pos3970"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Right.   Did you ever, did Adriaan ever tell you where this idea of a cell had originated, where he'd got the</p>

<p class="line" id="line3974"><a name="pos3974"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> He told me about this friend of his, who had told him to become involved in the Vaal Triangle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3975"><a name="pos3975"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> Did he say anything more regarding this friend?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3976"><a name="pos3976"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> Yes.   Well at that stage, as I understand it, at that stage I didn't know Robbie Coetzee personally, I just heard of him, he was a member of the motor bike club and I'd heard of him, but I'd never personally met him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3977"><a name="pos3977"></a><span class="speaker">QUESTION:</span> You had also testified earlier that you were a member of the CP, the Conservative Party?</p>

I always kept myself slightly apart, I met many of the people there, until later on I, if I could have made a final decision, I would have joined them, but I never got that far.   I always just pursued their objectives, I was in agreement with what they were fighting for.</p>

<p class="line" id="line4012"><a name="pos4012"></a>numbered, but that is the witness' statement, I am referring to paragraph 9 thereof, paragraph 9 of the statement, and the paragraph reads as follows:-</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line4013"><a name="pos4013"></a>"The reason why we grabbed hold of them was to tie them up and then to remove the truck."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line4014"><a name="pos4014"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4015"><a name="pos4015"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Is it correct that the purpose and the reasons mentioned in your statement was to actually rob or to steal the vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4016"><a name="pos4016"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> Are you saying what was the purpose?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4017"><a name="pos4017"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Yes, the purpose, you say "the reason why we tied them up was to remove the truck", so the purpose or reason was to actually rob the truck?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4018"><a name="pos4018"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> To remove it, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4019"><a name="pos4019"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> And that had nothing to do with any political objectives, am I correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4020"><a name="pos4020"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> As I said, it was to show the government and other private institutions, to show them that their black night watchmen were not competent for the job.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4021"><a name="pos4021"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Yes, but according to your statement, you actually put it very nicely, the reason why you tied them up, and that was to remove the truck.   Was that perhaps a mistake?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4022"><a name="pos4022"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> No, no, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4023"><a name="pos4023"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> And that was repeated in paragraph 16 of your statement, which reads as follows</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line4024"><a name="pos4024"></a>"The reason why we took the truck..."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line4025"><a name="pos4025"></a>that's the second reason:-</p>

<p class="line" id="line4027"><a name="pos4027"></a>Do you understand that?   In other words, the second reason</p>

<p class="line" id="line4031"><a name="pos4031"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> No, I am not quite with you, I don't understand?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4032"><a name="pos4032"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Must I repeat that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4033"><a name="pos4033"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> Yes please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4034"><a name="pos4034"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> The paragraph reads as follows, it's paragraph 16</p>

<p class="line" id="line4036"><a name="pos4036"></a>Do you understand that?</p>

<p class="line" id="line4038"><a name="pos4038"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Now, my statement is that this reason shows that the act which you committed had nothing whatsoever to do with political objectives.  Do you understand me now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4039"><a name="pos4039"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4040"><a name="pos4040"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> And this also links up with paragraph 9, which I read to you earlier, do you agree?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4041"><a name="pos4041"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> Yes, I'm with you, but it actually amounts to the same thing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4042"><a name="pos4042"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> How so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4043"><a name="pos4043"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> That is why we removed the truck, to prove that the people weren't competent to do this work.   Now you're saying that we didn't mention anything about tying up, to me that's all one and the same thing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4044"><a name="pos4044"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> No, no, I agree with you, I agree with the reason which you've now mentioned, but what I would like to put to you is that the reasons which you mentioned in your statement is proof that what you did had nothing to do with political objectives, do you understand me?</p>

In the context of the statement as a whole, it is part of a story which was told and it is actually taken out of context.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4048"><a name="pos4048"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> You say it's not political, but isn't this very similar to (indistinct) action, that what they were saying was that these jobs should not be given to black people, they should be reserved for whites, isn't that what he's saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4049"><a name="pos4049"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> That can be drawn, but that is what I'm trying, that is why I'm putting these questions to him, is for him to come out with that.

<p class="line" id="line4056"><a name="pos4056"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> What was the nature of your previous convictions, maybe, I mean, I'm planting wrong convictions on you, what were your previous convictions?</p>

<p class="line" id="line4064"><a name="pos4064"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> And you were released on the 9th of June 1989?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4065"><a name="pos4065"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4066"><a name="pos4066"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> You committed this offence after you were released from prison?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4067"><a name="pos4067"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4068"><a name="pos4068"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER:</span> Mr Van Straaten, is it correct that you had a drinking problem?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4069"><a name="pos4069"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> No, no chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4070"><a name="pos4070"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER:</span> Were you not also convicted of driving under the influence of drink?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4071"><a name="pos4071"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> Yes, that's true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4072"><a name="pos4072"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER:</span> On more than one occasion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4073"><a name="pos4073"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> Yes, on about three different occasions, but each one of us at social occasions would have a drink and perhaps we encounter a road blockade, our alcohol percentage is too high.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4074"><a name="pos4074"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER:</span> Yes.   On that Saturday, what time did you start drinking on that Saturday?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4075"><a name="pos4075"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> Approximately ten o'clock in the morning, when those bars open.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4076"><a name="pos4076"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER:</span> Ten o'clock in the morning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4077"><a name="pos4077"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4078"><a name="pos4078"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER:</span> Did you continue drinking throughout the day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4079"><a name="pos4079"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> If I had continued drinking throughout the day, then I should have been asleep by 12 o'clock that night, I wouldn't have been able to commit an offence, so I don't want to blame the alcohol, I don't want to say that it's because of alcohol that I committed the offence.</p>

<p class="line" id="line4081"><a name="pos4081"></a>255	W VAN STRAATEN</p>
<p class="line" id="line4082"><a name="pos4082"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER:</span> No, I appreciate that, that you say it was, you don't want to hide behind the drink, but you were very strongly under the influence at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4083"><a name="pos4083"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> Yes, I wouldn't say strongly under the influence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4084"><a name="pos4084"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER:</span> Well, you must either have been strongly under the influence, or you must have been very resistant to alcohol?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4085"><a name="pos4085"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> Yes, maybe, if that's the way you put it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4086"><a name="pos4086"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER:</span> Mr Van Straaten, I would like to tell you I have real problems to see how the stealing of this vehicle could have had anything to do with the pursuing of political convictions or an attempt to try and influence the government to make any changes in the political situation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4087"><a name="pos4087"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> As I already said, what I wanted to try and prove by committing this act, well if it was our view to, if we wanted to steal the vehicle, we would, in the first place, have obtained a competent driver to drive the truck, because I didn't have that experience.   You are alleging that alcohol played a role in the commission of the offence.   Now if I was under the influence, got into a truck, which I didn't know how to operate, and then to try and drive this truck on a busy road, well it just doesn't make sense.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4088"><a name="pos4088"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER:</span> But didn't you perhaps just think that the truck was similar to a motor car and that you would be able to drive it quite easily?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4089"><a name="pos4089"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4090"><a name="pos4090"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER:</span> If it was your objective, could you not perhaps just have removed the vehicle, just to get it outside the gate, that would have made your point, you would</p>
<p class="line" id="line4091"><a name="pos4091"></a>2/	have/...</p>
<p class="line" id="line4092"><a name="pos4092"></a>256	W VAN STRAATEN</p>
<p class="line" id="line4093"><a name="pos4093"></a>have proved your point?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4094"><a name="pos4094"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> Well, to remove it from the premises, you see the vehicle wasn't found in my possession, whether I'd parked it just outside the gate or a couple of metres further on, remove is remove.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4095"><a name="pos4095"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER:</span> Yes, but you parked it about 300 to 400 metres away when its brakes failed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4096"><a name="pos4096"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> No, I'll tell you, this vehicle, from the moment that I'd removed it from the premises, the vehicle just wouldn't function properly, there was something wrong with it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4097"><a name="pos4097"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER:</span> Yes, and you had hoped that with the increase in pressure, the vehicle would start up again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4098"><a name="pos4098"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> No.  According to my experience, there are many easier ways to steal a vehicle, easier than the way in which we tried to do it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4099"><a name="pos4099"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER:</span> Yes, I believe that, but you didn't succeed in your aim.   Why didn't you take ropes with you to tie up the people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4100"><a name="pos4100"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> This was a transport company and you always find ropes on such a vehicle, underneath the vehicle, you usually find ropes present on such a vehicle, and that's the reason why I didn't take any ropes along with me, because I was sure I would find some on the premises.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4101"><a name="pos4101"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER:</span> Did your brother not tell you that he had ropes in the back of his vehicle and that you should use those?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4102"><a name="pos4102"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> No, he didn't.   No, we did not take our own ropes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4103"><a name="pos4103"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER:</span> Was that the first time you heard about those ropes, here today in this hall?</p>

<p class="line" id="line4106"><a name="pos4106"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4107"><a name="pos4107"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER:</span> When your brother mentioned it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4108"><a name="pos4108"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4109"><a name="pos4109"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE JAGER:</span> Thank you, chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4110"><a name="pos4110"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> But, Mr Van Straaten, you should have, or you would have had to tie up the night watchmen first, before you could get to the trucks?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4111"><a name="pos4111"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> Correct, when I entered the premises, Dawid and myself each grabbed a night watchman, we held onto them, Adriaan and Gideon then came and when they arrived, I let go of my night watchman and went off in my direction.   Each one of us had our own specific task.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4112"><a name="pos4112"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Yes, but I'm asking this question arising from the question asked by Mr De Jager, and you said in answer that you would have been able to obtain ropes in the truck, but what I'm putting to you is that you would have had to first tie up the guards before you could get to the truck where you would have then been able to find the ropes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4113"><a name="pos4113"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4114"><a name="pos4114"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> So what would you have used to tie up the night watchmen if you hadn't been able to get to the truck first?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4115"><a name="pos4115"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> As I explained to the committee, there are always pieces of canvas and ropes present in these trucks to cover the loads, the goods.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4116"><a name="pos4116"></a><span class="speaker">UNKNOWN SPEAKER:</span> Mr Van Straaten, I think what my learned friend is trying to ask you is, before you would be able to obtain the rope, you would have had to first neutralise the guard to be able to get to the truck and the rope, so how would you have neutralised him before obtaining the rope?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4117"><a name="pos4117"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> But that's what I'm telling the committee,</p>

<p class="line" id="line4119"><a name="pos4119"></a>258	W VAN STRAATEN</p>
<p class="line" id="line4120"><a name="pos4120"></a>and that's what I can't understand you, when Dawid and I entered the premises, we each of us grabbed hold of a night watchman.   My job was to remove the truck from the premises, I grabbed my guard and then left him to the other two accused to deal with.   Their task was to tie them up whilst I was supposed to go to the truck.   I wasn't told to first go and look for ropes, each one of us had our own very specific task.</p>

<p class="line" id="line4203"><a name="pos4203"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN STRAATEN:</span> We moved into town roughly in 1974, that's when we moved to town.   In 1975 my mother remarried.
