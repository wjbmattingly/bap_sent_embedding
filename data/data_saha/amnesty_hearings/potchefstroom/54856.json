It seems that the proper thing to do would be, apart from serving notice on them or notifying them, the proper thing to do would be to send the letter to the police Commissioner, the General Commissioner and leave it in his hands.   That having been said, we will now hold in abeyance the hearing of further evidence in the present applications and may we now proceed with the next application if we are ready to do so?   Before doing so, I think I should announce that we are happy to have with us Professor Meiring and Professor Mgwasa of the Rehabilitation and Reparation's Committee who are sitting here and who have been with us since this morning.   At some stage where you Mr Mpshe become aware of the fact that there might be individuals giving evidence who might require the attention of the Rehabilitation and Reparation's Committee, that they should be told that the representatives of the Committee are here and can be contacted through you.",

The main points that were to be discussed in the mass meeting was the crime that was taking high stands in the township.  I was one of the key speakers of the day.  During the proceeding of the meeting a report came in, that is the report as to what the deceased did to another woman who was a member of the ANC Women's League.  As a Chief Marshall I took out an order to the marshalls that were present at the mass meeting that they should rush to the place of the scene.  It is true they left and when they came back they came back with the deceased and they said he was the perpetrator.  Because we knew him as the\n4\tleader/...\n132\tMR BUSAKWE\nleader of the gangsters called Kofifi.  They brought him back.  When he arrived at the mass meeting we wanted to know from the comrades who brought him back as to what happened actually and they requested the deceased to tell the story himself and he explained what happened on that day with that woman.  After his explanation, because I was in the leadership, we took a decision that the deceased should be taken to the police station.  Many people in the mass meeting, after listening to his story, there was now a division among the people present at the meeting, especially the women.   That is where we saw angry women, demanding that he should be killed.  We pleaded as the leadership that the police should be given the last chance with regard to this deceased.  It was a continuous strike and the position was that he should be taken direct to the police station.\nThere were marshalls elected to escort the deceased to the police station.  About five minutes after they have left we heard a gunshot and when we heard this gunshot people dispersed and many of them ran towards the direction of the gunshot.  We ran towards that direction also and when we arrived we found the deceased lying on the ground.  He was being stoned, he was being stabbed with knives and when I arrived, together with Comrade Buda Diamond, we appealed to the people who were killing and assaulting this person.  We said, stop it, but unfortunately when we arrived he was already dead.  Because I, together with comrade, picked him up from the ground and when we tried to pick him up that is when  Richard Faunda arrived and he had an iron bar in his hand and he hit him on the head and that was the end of the deceased.  We put him on the floor and another woman came with a rag and a blanket and we put it over to the deceased.\n4\tAfter/...\n132\tMR BUSAKWE\nAfter doing that, one of the accused, Mr Solomon Lekitlana, came with petrol and he poured the deceased with petrol and I rushed to him and I stopped him not to carry on with that action because the person was already dead.

He was not prepared to reconcile with us at all. There were two viewpoints in that extraordinary meeting. The first one was that Nzimeni must be attacked and the rest of the group must be put on the run.  And the next view point was that Nzimeni must be taken to the police. This view was advanced by myself an Patrick Mkontwana as members of the working committee which was established in accordance to the Groote Schuur minute to diffuse all possibilities of violence that might occur in the township, particularly due to the confrontation between the police and the ANC members. Then what happened afterwards, we agreed that we should take them to the police, we'll apprehend them and take them to the police because I did raise this issue in one of our meetings as a working group and Mr de Beer who was a policeman and was a member of the working group, apparently, said that they ran away from the location and therefore it's not easy to locate them.

When we got to the taxi rank we found the taxi and the driver.  When we asked him as to where were the people that that you were transporting yesterday, at night, he said that he does not work at night, there is someone else who does the night duty, he only does the day duty.  We explained to him clearly our position to the taxi drivers who were there on the 31st of October 1990, we were explaining them clearly about our standpoint as the ANC Stilfontein Branch in the location, that we please plead with them to help us find Njima Nzimeni, should he hijack one of their taxis they must please go straight to the police station.  And whilst we were trying to explain this to these taxi drivers, Charles Mhlambiso was supported by the comrades that were accompanying me, he was near Nzimeni. Please bear in mind that Nzimeni's house is not so far from the taxi rank.  On arrival of the comrades at Nzimeni's house, as we were busy addressing the taxi drivers, the comrades they started beating up Charles Mhlambiso with pangas and knives because we were armed all the time. Then we rushed to the scene. When we got to the scene I started pulling Charles Mhlambiso from a ...(indistinct) and I explained to the comrades that our attitude and our standpoint in the meeting, I instructed two marshals to take Charles to the police on the 31st of October in the morning. Then we went into Nzimeni's house.  When we got inside I spoke to his mother and wanted to know where Nzimeni is.  She told me that he ran away. I enquired at the people in the street as to whether they did see him.  No, nobody knew.  Now I started to become scared because the \n1A.\tcomrades/...\n153\ncomrades were very angry.  They were angry because we managed to stop them killing Charles because they'd already poured petrol on him and they were about to set him alight looking for matches when I stopped them.  The comrades were very angry. And that is not a surprise because in our meeting there were mixed feelings as to whether we must kill them or what exactly must we do with them. I went to Mrs Botman who is the front opposite with Mrs Mazwi which is Nzimeni's mother. When I got to Mrs Botman who is a member of the ANC Youth League and she used to help us with food, I did explain to her my concern and my fear that the comrades can do something that I am not sure as to what it is.  As I was still discussing this with Mrs Botman we heard noise and then when we rushed out we found comrades, they were beating up Nzimeni. They hit him with pangas and knives, with everything they came across. I just stood there, I never went there to try and interfere. As the leader of the comrades, as the leader of SAYCO, as a member of the executive of the ANC and as a member of the working group as well, I never tried to stop the comrades to do this and in that respect I'm guilty. I'm not immune from any sense of guilty. I feel more guilty than the active participants in the actual deed because if I did use my powers as a leader, this would not have happened.  If I did go try and stop them and reminded them about our standpoint in the meeting, this would have never happened. In that respect I'm very sorry.  I'm sorry to God my creator, I'm sorry to Mrs Mazwi, the mother, I'm sorry to Mrs Mazwi, the wife, I'm sorry to the rest of the bereaved family.  I failed Nzimeni, I accept and I admit in front of this Committee, that I did fail Nzimeni. And after that Nzimeni \n1A.\tlay/...\n154\nlay down next to the taxi rank because they were driving him all the way along.  On arrival I advised the comrades to go back to Mrs Agnes' house. When we got to Mary Agnes' house I advised the comrades further who were present at that \nmoment, who participated in the murder of Nzimeni, that they should leave.  They should run away because the police will be coming after us and we knew that they will be coming at Mary Agnes' house to arrest us. And once again I'm sorry to Mrs Mazwi that the people who victimised her child, I personally advised them to run away, but I'm not sorry to the criminal system about the thing that I did. I'll stop there.",

            "I'm talking about the South African Youth Congress. On the 23rd of August 1990, we were to have a meeting.  Okay let me go a bit further back, before the 23rd of August there was a meeting organised somewhere in July, it was an organised mass meeting. That mass meeting, it was going to discuss about the invitation to the MDM coming from the policemen who were based at the location, there was a threat and a rumour around the location that the houses of\n1A.\tthe/...\n155\nthe police would be burned down because of the murder Hendrick Mkwanasi who was murdered by the police by two policemen and the house of one of the policemen was burned down. There was that threat that the policemens' houses would be burned down.  We had a meeting as MDM structures whether to accept the invitation or reject it after the invitation of the police.  Then we could not reach an agreement as to whether we should reject or accept that because of political implications of it.  Then we decided to take the matter to the mass meeting and indeed we did call the mass meeting to discuss the issue.  Whilst we were busy debating this issue in this mass meeting Nzimeni and his group arrived.  They had pangas and knives.  They had all the weapons you can think of that are dangerous except for guns, and they had car tyres around their necks which is a necklace symbol, in the past. They said we are selling them out as leadership and we are selling them out to our killers.  They threatened to attack us then and there. Nomazwe Chonemane, who used to work in the Lawyers for Human Rights who was there in the meeting as a resident of Kuma now she's a member of parliament in the North West Region, she tried to speak to Nzimeni and his group that the issue has not yet been finalised, we are still debating the issue and they must just be part and parcel of the deliberations of the meeting. And if ever you're reject it, just try and be available.  They did not want to take Nomazwe Jomela's advice.  We decided as leadership then and there that we must just recess.  That I knew him as a member of the South African Youth Congress is because he used to be present in our meetings and he was present in that meeting on that particular day but the manner and the approach that he used, 1A.\tI/...\n156\nI started suspecting him personally that there was something that was just not proper with him. But my analysis about him was not conclusive as such.  Thereafter we went to Mary Agnes' house then we discussed a few things furthermore, because there was the issue of the rent in the location that we were still discussing. And on the 23rd of August 1990, we were going to discuss the issue of rent in the location.  We were going to have a mass meeting in the local stadium.  We were preparing for the mass meeting that was to be on the 26th of August 1990. On arrival at the meeting in the local creche, the meeting didn't materialise because of the absence of certain key figures that were going to be there in the preparation of this mass meeting or mass rally. On the 26th of August or just before that, on our way out to Mary Agnes to try and contact these leaders that were absent, we met Nzimeni and his group being armed with these pangas and kerries and knives, they were having food and tinned stuff and bread.  We met them between creche and shops just in the open, being the leadership in the location they stopped us to find out that we did get the permission to use the stadium.  Mary Agnes Kunwana did explain to them that the permission issue of the stadium will be sorted out and they told that it is wanted urgently. We wondered as to what is happening.  We enquired as to where they were going to.  They just told us that they were monitoring in the location.  Having passed the shops, the shops were still open, they were carrying food and firearms. We suspected that there was something that they might have done. We enquired in the shopowners as to what happened. They told us that there were people who claimed that they were comrades and took food forcefully from their shops.  Then we went \n1A.\tback/...\n157\nback to Mary Agnes' house.  Then we discussed informally that these people, they are not comrades, they cannot be called comrades and (Tape 1A ends....)\n......prepared for the meeting to be held on the 26th of August. I was assigned to go an get permission to use the stadium from the Chief Magistrate.  I was on very good terms with the Chief Magistrate of Klerksdorp.  In most cases we are not allowed to use stadiums in the location, particularly the police, they didn't like the idea, I don't know why. Then I came back with the permission to use the stadium.  It was on Friday when I came with the permission.  On the 26th of August, in the morning, my father woke me up to say that I've got a phone call from Mary Agnes. Mary Agnes told me to arrive at her house urgently.  Then I hurried there.  On my arrival I found certain ANC leaders in the location.  When I enquired if there was any problem they told me that Nzimeni came into Mary Agnes' house with a large group at about half past four in the morning, being heavily armed with pangas and they explained to Mary Agnes that no leader of MDM will be allowed to talk with the residents in the township. No leader's going to address that mass meeting on that day, and they demanded a sound speaker that we used to use in mass meetings and it belonged to Mary Agnes' sister who was staying in Johannesburg, for use in our meetings and they demanded that they will be back to collect them.  So we sat and waited.  They came, these people, with people that were being intimidated to join that group, to go to the stadium. That group just showed that they were heavily armed.  They went into Mary Agnes' street and I was terrified and quiet and one of them did ask me as to why am I so quiet. I just wanted to know as to what should I say.  1B.\tHe/...\n158\nHe told me that he must use the speaker.  I told him that you've got the speaker, we'll give you the speaker.  I told him that Derek Kosi, who was a member of the ANC and who was in the leadership as well will transport it with his car.  They said no, there's too many soldiers out there. So therefore they carried the speaker to the stadium.  Most of the people who were there, you could actually see that they were intimidated.  They looked surprised and confused, they did not know what was happening. They saw that here's the leadership that we've chosen, but what is actually happening?  Some of us came back to us, they never actually reached the stadium.  Those who came back, they told us that they were being taken forcefully out of the house with knives and pangas. One of these cases we referred to the police station, that it should deal with those matters, we don't have the power to deal with those. Then we proceeded to the stadium and we sat down as the leadership to discuss some of these issues, particularly in relation as to what was happening at that time regarding Nzimeni's issue and his group.  We came to a conclusion that we must go to a main hall because there was a meeting of National Union for Mine Workers.  When we got there we explained the situation to the comrades of the mines.  The workers gave us 50 marshals and two leaders of National Union of Mine Workers and go to the stadium and try and find out as to what is happening and what's Nzimeni's problem, because you know him as a member of the Youth Congress.  When we got to the stadium with the marshals, two leaders of the National Union of Mine Workers, they got to the podium to try and talk to Nzimeni. Nzimeni made his point very clear that these things have got nothing to do with the mines, it's a location issue",

On that same day, after having beaten them up we took them home.

You better stay just where you are. And I assured her that I'm safe because there's comrades in Agnes' house.  On Wednesday I was arrested for beating these people.  After a lengthy trial at the regional court which took a year, in the Klerksdorp Regional Court, we were acquitted on the basis of lack of evidence against accused.  It was myself, Siabonga Sebe, Walter Siharudzi and Albie Fasie.  All of us were in this case of beating these other group members.

Baring we took him after having made efforts of having to make peace meetings between us and Nzimeni, because our perception that we were trying to explain to Nzimeni the transformation from SAYCO to African National Congress Youth League. After that we sent Baring to the police station to go and lay charges against this group and he did so and he lay charges against Nzimeni and his group, and no arrests were ever made and Nzimeni and the other people who assaulted Baring.  The second one relates to the issue of Violet.  Violet was a member of ANC Womens' League, she was attacked by Nzimeni at her house.  Apparently if I remember clearly, Violet was pregnant then and after they have beaten her up and harassed her and it seems she got a miscarriage due to that and no arrests were made in respect to that after that event. And due to intervention of Mary Agnes she discussed it with the Lawyer for Human Rights.  After having discussed with the Lawyer for Human Rights that they must try and follow this issue for Nzimeni regarding Violet's issue, two people were arrested, and after that they were given lenient sentences of two years each after all the things that they did to Comrade Violet who was an active of the ANC Womens' League.  2A.\tThose/...\n168\nThose are some of the things that I remember clearly that we never showed them in this document.

I entered through the window because at the time the doors were opened, then I entered through the window.  Then I found the wife of the deceased and a certain lady called Lizzie inside one of the rooms.  When they saw me to believe that maybe the deceased is in the house.  The way they were acting they were acting suspicious to show me that maybe the deceased is inside the house.  They were looking frightened.  The wife of the deceased took off the clothes and then he said he should not talk, she will give me.  She took off her clothes that I should tell other comrades. As a disciplined member I knew that I didn't come here to have sex with her. I went straight to the wardrobe then opened the wardrobe and then pick him out. Their eyes when they were talking with me,\n3A.\tthey/...\n187\nthey were showing me that there is something in a wardrobe, then I went directly to the wardrobe, then I took him off the wardrobe.  They tried to plead with me, the wife exposed her thighs, so that I should just keep silent, because the comrades are angry they may kill her husband.  Then I took him by the hand then I shouted, then I shouted at the comrades that the person they are looking for, here is he, who is a liar. The first one who arrived first is Frans Masike, he's the one who met with me after I've shouted, then he entered.  Then he was followed by other comrades.  Then they took him off outside the house, it is then that he started being assaulted, then other comrades came again, some of them were comrade Andrew Moloto, Comrade Rangamanju, Comrade Bulelane, Comrade Coloma, Comrade Charlie, Comrade Albie Fasie. When he went out of the house he was assaulted already.  We went out through the door, being assaulted at the time. At the time other comrades were coming again and there were many.  Then they took him out, they turned through the passage, to the taxi rank.  I was following other comrades. When they were still assaulting him, those which I have already explained about, Comrade Frans was having a knife in his hand and Comrade Bulelane also was having a knife in his hand.  They stabbed him on the neck.  At the time he was powerless and then Comrade Bulelane were the ones who finished him off.  After that other people came with their stones and hitting him.  Comrade Andrew Moloto, when he was already finished, at that time he was having petrol, Comrade Moloto sprinkled him with petrol and he wanted to burn him.  It was not possible, one of the comrades prevented him not to burn him because he's already dead. Thereafter, then we went to Mary Agnes, at the time \n3A.\tthe/...\n188\nthe deceased was dead and the police came, then we went to Mary Agnes' house.  We advised the comrades who were seen doing the act to leave.  To the wife of the deceased I ask forgiveness what I have done because now she doesn't have the husband anymore. To the mother of the deceased, to Mrs Mazwi, I say sorry because she doesn't have a child any more and because of that I really ask for forgiveness and not forgetting to Charles I ask him forgiveness.

            "Thank you. In 1990 the ANC Youth League was not yet known as ANC Youth League.  It was named according to the township where the people used to stay.  So our ANC\n3B.\tYouth/...\n198\nYouth League  was KUYUCO and all these boys, that is the vigilantes and the ANC Youth League belonged to the same camp. They were all ANC members.  And unfortunately \nthe police infiltrated our organisation.  That is Mr de Kock, Pretorius, and Vermaak. They divided the organisation into two.  The other group was the ANC Youth League, and the other group was KUYUCO and the KUYUCO was the one which was bribed by the police. So the police used these boys left and right.  They gave them weapons, they gave them drugs, they gave them marijuana, they gave them liquor and they used their leader's house as the office and the police provided them with a telephone, so that they could phone and inform them.  And they used to make it a point that people in that house were as comfortable as possible.  Every day in the afternoon there was a house which was burned, which was burned on the 16th of June by the youth in our community, which was occupied by one of the police who was also one of the chief movers, who wanted to see us all dead because they did not want the ANC.  They used to dump food there and everything and these boys would smoke their drugs and from there they would go hunting for the ANC Youth League.  They used to chop them with axes, they used to attempt to shoot them.  It was terrible. It was youth against youth. It was Black against Black.  And when we called the police, the police used to protect them. They would teargas the Youth League so that these people could get a chance of doing whatever they wanted to do.  And as a result, all these boys, the Youth League, the ANC Womens' League, Civic Associations, COSATU, SACP, every organisation, used to stay in my house because whenever we went out we used to be beaten up.  When we go to work we used to go in groups.  \n3B.\tWhen/...\n198\nWhen the children go to school, they used to go in groups. That's the life we used to live.  And every five minutes I was in jail, I was arrested by de Kock and he would tell me that INKATHA is going to burn my house and all those boys who are staying there will all die. But he never made it to that. So to come to the short story of the whole thing, why this boy was murdered.",

Fortunately, whenever the ANC Youth met, we used to\n3B.\thave/...\n199\nhave some people who stand outside to watch for the enemy so that we could be able to combat the enemy when it comes.  And as they were standing outside, this very Mazwi with his group, they were in a taxi and unfortunate for them, a second house from my house, it's a spot.  So the mine people used to drink there.  So they realised that they will not be able to land the bomb which they had, which they were going to use to explode the house, and I understand it was a dynamite. So realising that they would not be able to reach the house, they threw the dynamite out.  So the boys who were standing outside, they thought that it was a cricket, so they ran to extinguish the cricket, and the mine people warned them and said, run away, that is a dynamite. It went, I understand it burned until it came to where it should explode. It exploded and fortunately where we were was not affected.  It was only the houses next to the place where we were and the electric house, which exploded.  But it was not a dangerous explosion because they say dynamite cannot explode that fiercely if it is not put under a rock or something.  So after it had exploded the youth was very cross. They went and hijacked the taxis and the people from the mine assisted them.  They went all into the taxis to look for these boys so that they could revenge for what thy had done.  Unfortunately they could not find them on that night.  They came back to the house and they slept and in the morning they woke up without anybody seeing to stop them to do what they wanted to do.  They went to Mazwi's place and they found him. They pulled him out of the house to the taxi rank and at the taxi rank this boy was killed by the whole community.  Everybody came with sticks, with stones, with everything on him and other people actually identified \n3B.\ttheir/...\n200\ntheir clothes on him.

We tried to maintain peace and understanding of development of the organisation, that it's no longer Youth Congress, it's an ANC. We tried to make them understand that, and thereafter the two groups reconciled and then there was peace. On the first day, in the first peace call and thereafter it showed that peace did not prevail again.  Another meeting was called again, it was in Kuma.  We went to that meeting and there still it was tried to reconcile these two groups and there were discussions held. There it seemed as well that there was reconciliation, only found out that it didn't.  The third meeting that I attended, was at night in a creche. It was the very same two groupings.

The particular property of Terblanche Transport was the third property past which we drove.   I saw the night watchman there.   The property was not clearly secured, there was only a chain which served as a gate.   The first thought that came to my mind was that it would be easy to gain entrance to the property.   We drove somewhat past, left the vehicle there and then decided that Willem and Dawid would first enter the property, with the purpose of tackling the night watchman and tying him up.   Gideon and myself then entered the property after them.   Upon entering the property, I saw that there were two night watchmen.   The moment we came next to them, Willem and Dawid each grabbed a night watchman.   I then knocked them over the head with a flashlight.   I then told Dawid and Gideon to go and see whether there were any ropes in the property with which we could tie up the night watchmen.   They came back and I then gave them instructions to guard the night watchmen.   Willem had already moved into the property by that time.   I moved deeper into the property and then found him at one of the trucks there.   He then told me that this particular truck is right in front of the gate, and that it would be easy for us to remove this particular vehicle.   We began\n1/\topening/...\n224\tA VAN STRAATEN\nopening up the vehicle and to prepare to remove it from the property.   While we were busy, I heard a noise, and I told Willem that I would go and see what was happening.    At the place where I left David with the one night watchman, I saw that he and the night watchman were struggling.   I approached and kicked against something on the ground, which I then picked up and it was the particular, an axe or whatever, with which I attacked the night watchman.   I then gave the chisel to Dawid and told him to look after the night watchman.   He then told me that he couldn't find any ropes, and I then told him to see to it that the night watchman would not get up again.   I returned to the vehicle, where I told Willem that one of the night watchman were now hurt with the chisel.  I told him that we would have to hurry up to remove the vehicle so that we could get away from this particular property.   He then started up the truck.   I returned to Dawid and told him to collect Gideon and open the gate so that we could leave the property with the truck.   He went to Gideon and told Gideon to get into the truck with Willem.  Dawid then took the chain which served as a gate, he opened that up, Willem and Gideon then left the property with the truck.   Dawid and I went in the opposite direction around the block and moved back to my own car.   We got into the car and picked up Willem and Gideon where they had left the truck.",
