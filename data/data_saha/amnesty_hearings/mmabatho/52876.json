I spoke to them, I served them with the necessary notices and they were willing to come.  But I arranged with them that they be here only tomorrow.\n\tNow I mention this, Mr Chairman because the person who wanted them in attendance is no more in this forum, which would mean that I will have to stop their coming because I don't need them.  They are wanted by AWB, but our agreement with Mr Van Der Berg is to the effect that he may want to use them later but we can only get an indication at lunch time.

And with all respect, this amendment cannot be granted because he has only done this afterwards.  He wants to supplement his documents, and if you look at bundle A, this is the bundle that has all the affidavits, nowhere these allegations are made.  If those allegations were made in the affidavits or if the evidence was given to the TRC, then maybe one can say, I want to supplement it now, but that case was never decided on so I believe that his amendment cannot be made because he is supplementing it now.",

If one takes a look at Section 11b of the application form, the applicant describes his actions, 'as being done while acting in my official capacity as a member of the Bop Police'.  I think that in the light of this, perhaps what Adv Mpshe and Adv Motata have said there should perhaps be more substantial reasons for the application and perhaps that can be done at a later stage in the hearing.  Give you some time to do it.  I don't think we need delay the start of the matter.  We'll proceed with the matter on the application as it is and then if you wish to make this application at a later stage, then that can be considered then but I don't think that should delay the matter now.

            "In 1994 I was at my residential place in Siweding(?).  It was in the afternoon whilst I was still in the house I heard some noise outside, some people who were shouting.  I went outside to see as to exactly what was happening.  When I got there I saw people running around on the streets and singing ANC songs and they were raising their hands saying that Mangope's government has fallen.  They were running towards Mega City and saying Mega City was on fire.  When I looked in that direction of Mega City I saw a huge smoke there.\n\tWhilst we were sleeping at night, it was at about ten o'clock, when one of the members of the defence force of the Bophuthatswana who also residing in the same yard, knocked on my door and explained to me as to how the AWB has arrived in Mafikeng and had taken control over the aviation defence force.  I became quite nervous when I heard him saying this because I knew that the defence  was the stronghold of the government.  And therefore I was scared that us as the police won't be able to control the situation should war start.\n\tI slept and in the morning I was supposed to be on duty from 6 o'clock but one neighbour who is also a policeman came to me and told me that he had made a call to the station and he was told that it is not safe to go dressed in uniform because of all the unrest.  He told me not to dress in the uniform and we should drive in his car to TTA to go and see what was happening there.  And we did that.\n\tWe drove off in his car and on our way we saw some, the roads blocked with car scraps and stones and people were screaming that Mangope has fallen down and viva ANC.  We drove up to the head office and when we got there the situation was completely changed.  It was not the head office that we knew.  The police were standing in small groups as if they did not know where they belonged.  We parted with my neighbour and we went to our different offices.\n\tWhen I got to my office, I found some of the policemen who I work with not dressed in uniform like me.  A car was taken out so that we should go and dress in our uniforms and we were given firearms.  I was given an R4 rifle.  We got into the car and drove home to take our uniforms.\n\tPeople were passing in front of us and screaming viva ANC.  We could see that it is not possible for the Mangope government to go on because people showed that they were sick and tired of it.  And we also raised our arms and showed them that we are in support of what they were saying. (The sound is cutting - the interpretation cannot pick up all the information)",

            "I was given an R4 rifle and we went into the car and we drove off and we passed by groups of people who were singing songs, screaming viva ANC and down with Mangope.  We did the same, we lifted our arms and called out viva, viva.\n\tWhen I arrived at my residential place I took my uniform.  I put it in a bag and when on my way into the car, my landlord told me that I should not come with a police car in his premises because I will land him into trouble.  Well I went into the car and we drove off helping the others to pick up their uniforms as well and we drove back to the headquarters of the police.\n\tAnd on our arrival there we went into the barracks to get dressed into our uniforms and thereafter, back to the offices.  One police officer, whose name I cannot recall, called the policemen and explained to them as to what has happened to the police and the armed forces.  And he said that we must stay alert because the AWB can come to the police to take over.  We dispersed and we were just around the TTA yard.\n\tBetween 12 o'clock and 1 o'clock in the afternoon we went to the kitchen to have our lunch.  Whilst we were sitting there and having our lunch we heard some firearms shooting outside and I became nervous because I did not know what was happening and as to what is going to happen to us and our dear lives.\n\tI went outside and I saw the main gate of TTA and there were vans passing by full of white men dressed in khaki and they were armed with guns and I heard a gun shot from those cars and that hit in front of my foot and I landed on the ground.  I was diving for cover.  I crawled to the wall which is the perimeter(?) wall of TTA.  I stayed there and the gun firing was gosrging on.  \n\tThereafter I heard people approaching and they were screaming and shaking the gate of the TTA saying that the police must give them the firearms.  When they entered they saw me lying there and they asked me to give them the firearm or else protect them or defend them.  But because I knew what was the policy about the handling of firearms, I refused giving them the firearms but decided to defend them rather.  \n\tI had no choice because there were so many in number.  I went out with them.  I was in the middle, went across the tar road in front of TTA and I lied in some bushes around there.  After some time I heard these people screaming out loudly, AWB, AWB.  And after sometime a blue Mercedes Benz was approaching and they were shooting and they went past where I was lying and at that time I could not shoot because there were so many people who were in front of me and I did not want to injure them. \n\tAnd I asked them to please stay clear and they did that.  I shot one warning shot in the air, trying to scare these gentlemen in the blue Mercedes Benz., but they continued shooting.  And that is when I saw that this is a war.  And I shot back at them.  As I was shooting I heard somebody screaming saying that they have just shot me.  And as I was looking this person was bleeding on his thigh.  I continued shooting until the Mercedes Benz came to a standstill at the \"STOP\" next to the TTA and I ran towards it.\n\tOn my way I went past some woman who was lying on her back bleeding in her belly.  And this raised my emotions and I was very hurt and upset by the way that the black nation was being destroyed by these white men.  I was very angry and nervous and hurt.  When I got to these three AWB men I asked them where are they from?  One of them of which I don't recall, as to at which side was he, he answered by saying that he is from Naaboomspruit.  \n\tI asked again as to what are you doing here and who called you?  The one answered saying, go and ask your State President.  I was very nervous.  But his response or his answer, it  just showed that there is tension, there is war and one called out saying that they want some ambulance and I answered back and said why didn't you bring your ambulance here.  As I was talking to him, one of them moved and as he was moving his hand went underneath and I thought that he was pulling a firearm and I realised now that the trouble had started and then I started shooting them, one by one with my R4 rifle and thereafter I went back into the TTA yard.\n\tWhat I am here for today is to ask for amnesty and forgiveness from the family members of Uys, Wolfaardt and Fourie.  It is because I know that it is very painful to lose a husband, a father and a family member, but please pardon me for what I have done.  There was no alternative because I thought that it was a situation of war prevailing.  \n\tIf we can look back, people who were killed in Bophuthatswana who were helpless and who knew nothing about handling firearms were killed and injured here in Bophuthatswana, who have never actually laid their hands on the arms, they have just seen them in the newspapers and in the televisions.  People who were just going about their own daily routines and in their own country were killed, innocent as they were.\n\tBut anyway, Fourie and Wolfaardt and the Uys families must please forgive me for what happened but it happened under a war situation.  It has, it was thought that Sergeant Nare was the one who did these.  And he suffered because of these and him and his family went through all the trouble and he was suspended from his work.  Therefore I saw it necessary for me to come forward to this Commission and say the truth that Nare is not responsible for all these but myself, Menyatsoe.  \n\tI'm here today because I want to help Nare because he was being blamed for all these.  I am clearing his name and I am here today to tell the whole country that I am the one who killed the three AWB members, your soldiers, Mr Eugene Terreblanche.

The Captain told me that these men are policemen and they are looking for you regarding the, what happened in 1994 and I asked my Captain as to do you believe yourself that these people are policemen and he said yes.\n\tI showed them my ID card that I am a policeman.  So I asked them to produce their cards as well.  They were standing next to the door and they had firearms in their waist and standing by the door they said that this bloody bastard does not cooperate. They said that in Afrikaans, in their language and this showed me or it came to me that it was not safe to go with these people although I did not know what was it was actually all about.\n\tAlthough I had asked my Captain and he just told me that it is about what happened in 1994 in Mafikeng. Then I asked him, exactly what of the 1994 happenings?  I asked them to go out and they did that and I phoned my lawyer but what is surprising is that they told me that the following day, I must appear in front of the Tebbutt Commission.  \n\tAccording to my knowledge, at that time the Tebbutt Commission was on recess.  I spoke to the lawyer and when I told him that they are taking me to the Tebbutt Commission he wondered as to which commission are they are talking about because the Tebbutt Commission is in recess.  He said I must let him speak to one of them on the phone and I gave them the phone and he did.  \n\tAnd they went away and waited for me at the police station thereafter.  I sat and had a discussion with my lawyer who advised me not to go with these people and he will try to talk to them so they should wait for you there at the Tebbutt Commission and I will bring you there, but you must not go with them.
