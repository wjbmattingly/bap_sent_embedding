<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Good morning everybody.  It's still the continuation of the applications of Mr Anthony Jagga and three others.  Mr Visser, we've just finished with your third applicant.  The ball is still in your court, the fourth application rather.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, Chairperson.  I was going to conclude by referring you to some attempts which were made by ourselves to try to obtain more information which could shed light on some of the issues that had been raised in cross-examination here, particularly in regard to the incident which took place and which Mr Jagga confirmed that he had heard about from the Lesotho police, that there was a shooting on a road somewhere and Chairperson, although we haven't got copies, may I read to you a letter written by my attorney, Wagener, on the 8th of November and it is a letter directed to the Commissioner of the Royal Lesotho Mounted Police, Maseru, Lesotho and it says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a>"Dear Sir, I represent a number of ex-members of the South African Police in their applications for amnesty to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and this letter is addressed to you on behalf of such clients, in a matter that is at present partly heard and which will proceed in Bloemfontein on 13 November 2000.  A dispute has arisen regarding an incident which took place during 1987 within your jurisdiction, namely the following:  (1) towards the end of 1987 and near Mafikeng, members of your department set up an official road block, (2) the driver of one vehicle failed to act correctly and a shoot-out followed killing one passenger and wounding another, (3) the wounded, a certain Atwell Maqhekeza was taken to the Queen Elizabeth II Hospital in Maseru for treatment, (4) however the following day the said injured passenger was shot and killed inside the hospital, (5) the exact date and particulars of the said incident are now in dispute.  In view of the aforesaid, you are kindly requested to forward me on an urgent basis, the following particulars:  (1) the date of the incident, (2) I am told that someone was later arrested and charged for the murder in the hospital, particulars thereof are also required, (3) the particulars of the road block,</blockquote>
<blockquote class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a>if available, are also required.  I look forward to your kind assistance herein."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a>Mr Jagga, as I am now told it is pronounced, Chairperson, took this matter up with the Lesotho police and discussed it with someone there, I don't know with whom and he was told that a letter has to be written in which the information was formally required and it is for that reason that this letter was addressed to the Commissioner.  Now I'm sad to inform you, Chairperson, that there has been absolutely no reaction and no result.  Mr Jagga, is still attempting to pursue the matter and I've understood from what Mr Malindi said yesterday, that they have also made attempts to pursue the matter, so it seems that the sign on the wall is, the writing on the wall is that we're not going to get an information and it's sad that that is so, because that could have established one way or the other, objectively some part of the evidence which we're now obviously going to have to do without, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a>	That being so, that is the evidence which we propose to present to you in support of the applications of the four applicants for their amnesty in the present incidents and so to speak, that's the case for the applicant.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Visser and you convey the indebtedness, which the Panel appreciates, from the efforts made by your attorney, please convey those sentiments.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a>	Then it would be for the victims, but to have a better record, Mr Malindi you indicated that you are also making attempts to get certain information, since Mr Visser took the initiative, could you just complete that phase before you tell me what you propose to do next?  That refers to you as well Mr Koopedi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Thank you Chairperson.  Chairperson, we have also tried to make further investigations on various aspects of this matter.  At this stage, Chairperson, we prefer not to divulge which annals of this case we are investigating.  A little bit of progress has been made, but we have not been able to finalise consultations with the people who could help in those aspects of this matter.  I may just indicate that we are forming a view and if our opinion is correct, at one or another stage we will, depending on whether we obtain the information we are endeavouring to get, we will bring an application for the re-opening of this matter, that's if in these proceedings it's permissible, but we see no reason why in the normal criminal and civil trials, such provisions are possible and failing which, we will follow other procedures to make sure that whatever we uncover is used for the benefit especially of the victims in this matter.  So the short and long of it Chairperson, is that our ...(indistinct) was, we are unable to divulge even to the Committee at this stage, except if we are required to do so in Chambers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Malindi.  I think we can take it up at a later stage, but what you have just alluded to, it's your right and the victim's right, but may I just bring to your attention that whatever you propose to do in future, you have this at the back of your mind, the last time the Amnesty Committee had a meeting, is that this is the last month where hearings are conducted and in terms of the Act that brought us into being, is that we've got to write a codicil, finalising all the process of the TRC per se and such process or the writing of the codicil, will be completed by March next year and the following month, or the same month, I'm not now very certain of my facts, is that it would be presented to the President and that would be announcing our death in terms of the Act and should there be some process or something whilst this is in process should happen, take into account that in December I'm assuming duties at the TPD, my Judge President is impatient with me, so effectively I'm with the Amnesty Committee up to the end of this month, so I want you just to be aware of some of these things and it is your right, I wouldn't bear upon you or put pressure upon you to divulge what you think is confidential and you are still doing investigations, but I should thank you as well, together with your attorney, that I'm most indebted to you, to the legal representatives, they have approached this matter with all diligence and trying to assist where there are deficiencies, that is most appreciated by my Panel.  Thank you.  Mr Visser has finished.  The ball is now in your court, I don't know what you propose doing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Thank you very much Chairperson.  Thank you also for bringing to our attention certain of the aspects relating to the life span and other things about the Amnesty Committee.  Chairperson, today we propose to call members of the families of the four people that disappeared in this matter.  Chairperson, they are going to be very short witnesses, I don't propose to make an opening address because the purpose of their testimony will come out of their own evidence.  Briefly, it is just to establish that contact was maintained, though erratic, between the disappeared and their families and that from December 1987 none of them made further contact with their families and our submission will therefore be that were they returned into Lesotho, they would have made some contact as they used to before and that is the basis on calling the witnesses and I hope that it is necessary, we believe it is necessary to call them, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a>	Chairperson then in as far as Ngulelo Ngono, the evidence that will be led will indicate that he had contact with his family post December 1987 and that our submission in that respect will be that he was not taken to Ladybrand in December, but his disappearance was as a result of subsequent operations and not related to the other three.  Thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So are you going to call the families as we have it on record, in other words starting with Ms Betty Boom, Nomasonto, Tax and then lastly Ngono?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Chairperson, not in that order.  I propose to call Mrs Mokhele first.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">SIPOLOLO MARIA MOKHELE:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you, you may be seated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR MALINDI:</span> Mrs Mokhele, could you tell the Committee how you are related to one of the people who disappeared in this matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> The person who disappeared is my son's child.  It happened that in 1987 two male persons arrived with a car at my house and I was outside.  They brought the child and a suitcase.  I was outside.  They entered through the gate.  They greeted us and inquired as to whether it's Mokhele's place, then we said yes.  They said:  "We've come here."  Then I made them to enter the house, then I called Mr Mokhele to inform him that there are guests.  He greeted them.  They gave us a letter, then I gave it Mr Mokhele, he read the letter.  The letter - they said that ...(indistinct) wanted us to have the baby, then we welcomed the child.  Then the second letter was produced, that we should give it to Mr Mashiya, then we told them to take the letter themselves.  They left to Mr Mashiya's place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Mr Mokhele do you remember the date on which the child was delivered at your place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> It was on the 24th of December.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Did you yourself read the letter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> My husband read the letter.  I ...(indistinct) the letter, even when my son arrived, I showed him the letter to read.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, please just repeat that, you cut off the first part inadvertently.  We can't hear you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> After my husband read the letter, ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> I'm repeating the same answer, I asked her to repeat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> After my husband had read the letter, I put the letter aside and then when my son arrived I showed him the letter to read.  That is all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> The son that you are referring to, who is that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> That is Tsietsi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> When you say when he arrived, where did he arrive from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> He was from exile.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, when did he arrive from exile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> If I'm not mistaken it was somewhere in 1993 during Chris Hani's funeral or death.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Thank you Chairperson, no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MALINDI</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Malindi.  Mr Visser any cross-examination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR VISSER:</span> Mrs Mokhele, who do you regard as the person who is representing you at these hearings, or the persons representing you at these hearings?  Who is speaking on your behalf?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> I don't understand the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Who is your representative here?  Listen carefully Mrs Mokhele, the question is, there are two legal</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a>counsels whom you are sitting between them, who is representing you between the two?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> The one who is on the right-hand side.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But she's indicating with her left-hand, am I correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> Yes, indicating to the left, but actually she is saying on the right-hand side.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Show us by hand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> The one I'm pointing at.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Pointing at Adv Malindi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> Yes, Malindi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And also Mr Koopedi, he's your attorney, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And Mr Mapoma, is he representing you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> So did you tell all three these representatives what you know about this case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> I hope I told them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you tell them that there were two letters that you know about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> Yes, there were two letters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And the fact that that was never put to any of the applicants, I take it you have no explanation for that not happening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> I believe they knew, because I told them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright.  What precisely - well you were asked, the first question you were asked in your evidence today was that you were related to one of the persons who disappeared, do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> But you never told us who this person was that disappeared.  Who was it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> Sonti Mashiya.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And is that your son's child?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You see I think there's a little confusion, may I try to assist you?  Isn't what you're really saying that Nomasonto Mashiya was your son's wife and your son's child is the child that was brought to you by the two unknown male persons, is that not really what you're saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> Yes, that is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright.  Now this letter that these two gentlemen - incidentally, did you know them from before, the two gentlemen that came with the child?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> I did not know them Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did they tell you where they were from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> They told me that they are from Lesotho.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did they tell you what work they did?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> They said they were comrades.  They were sent by Sonti to bring the child.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  And they gave you two letters, I understand, is that correct?  The one letter you accepted and the other one you said you must take that to Mr Mashiya yourself, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Now we're just going to talk about the one letter that you took from them.  This is the letter that you said Mr Mokhele read.  Now that Mr Mokhele is not your son, that is your husband?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> Yes.  That is correct, that was my husband.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> How did he read it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> He has since died.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Aright.  How did he read it?  Did he read it out aloud or did he read it for himself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> He was reading the letter aloud.  That is where the letter was saying that Sonti is sending the child home and the child's name was Mosana Reginald and then even then the child's age appeared, you know, was read from the letter.  If we were not at home, he should be taken at Mashiya's place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mrs Mokhele, in what language was this letter written?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> In Sotho.  The letter was written in Sotho.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did your husband understand Sotho?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> That's correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Now you've already started telling us about what the letter said, but I want to deal with that in more detail.  First of all, had you seen this child ever before that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> I saw him for the first time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> So you didn't know this child at all?  You never saw him before?</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Why is that?  Not seeing your son's child for two years, because he was apparently two years old at the time, wasn't he, in December 1987?</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> They were in exile.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Had you see photographs of him before?  Was a photograph sent to you of this grandchild of yours?</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> I hadn't seen photos before, that was for the first time I saw him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> In fact it seems that there was no contact, either between you and your son, while he was in exile, or between you and Nomasonto Mashiya, while she was in exile, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> My son was in Russia.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That's not my question.  I've put to you that it would appear that there was no contact in any way, between your son and yourself or Nomasonto Mashiya and yourselves, while she was and he was in exile.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> It was during that time, you would not be able to communicate through post or through letters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> So do you agree with me that there was no communication?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you then accept that this child was in fact your son's child when you got the letter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> Yes, Chairperson, I accepted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Because there was no way in which you could either confirm that it was so, or confirm that it wasn't so, not so?  You had no contact with your son or with Nomasonto.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> Yes, I just accepted that child as my grandchild.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Where is this child at the moment, is he still alive?</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> Yes, he's still alive.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And where is he, where does he live?</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> He is staying with me.  We came with him in Johannesburg.  We were not able to come with him here because he's writing exams.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I didn't want you to bring him here, the point is you have been looking after that child ever since?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> We were helping each other, myself and ...(indistinct) family.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, alright.  Now when your son returned from exile in 1993, did he recognise the child and confirm that it was his child and that of Nomasonto?</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> Yes, he confirmed, but we were still waiting for Nomasonto to return.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright.  Now this letter, you say the letter stated how old the child was, did you say that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> Yes, the letter stated that he was just about to finish the second year.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did the letter say anything about inoculations that the child has to receive, or injections?</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> Yes, Chairperson, the letter stated, because the letter was no accompanied by a clinic card, so it was stated in the letter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And when you refer to a clinic card, I take it you refer to those certificates which are issued by the clinics, which is a printed form, to say on this date he received that inoculation and the next inoculation he must receive will be on that date, is that what you're referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> Yes, that is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And the child's clothes were also brought by these two unknown gentlemen to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> That is correct, Chairperson, it was clothes and nappies.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What did you think was going on when this child arrived on your doorstep?</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> Can you start again, I missed the first part.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What did you think was going on when this child arrived on your doorstep with two strangers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> I was scared and surprised, because I was surprised why the child would be brought by male people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you ask the two gentlemen what their names were and what was going on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> We asked their identity, but the names are out of my memory.  They said that they were sent by Sonti to bring the child home and that they were comrades.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You still had this letter in 1993, according to your evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> Yes, the letter was there in 1993.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> So where is it now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> We searched the letter and we couldn't find it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Didn't you put it away in a safe place, it was an important letter, wasn't it?  It was the last time and in fact the only time that you heard from Nomasonto since she went into exile.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> I put it on a safe place, then I gave it to my son, so I don't know what happened thereafter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright, where is your son, Tsietsi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> He's there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> He's there, but he's not here today.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> He is present today.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> So perhaps he will give evidence and we might be able to ask him a whole lot of things.  Now, who is this Mr Mashiya?</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> He is present today.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Who is he?  Where does he fit into the picture?</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> He's Sonti's father.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I see.  So are you saying that there were two letters.  The one was addressed to yourself and your husband to look after the child and if you either did not want to or if they could not find you, there was a second letter to Mr Mashiya and I take it to his wife that they must look after the child, is that a reasonable inference to be drawn from your evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> Yes, because when we looked at these letters, they were written the same way.  All of them were contained in pink envelopes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes and it would make sense then that the contents of the letters would have been the same, or similar, the one addressed to you and the one addressed to them, because it would deal with the requirements of the child.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> Yes, much of the details were similar.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, I understand.  How well can you remember the details that were set out in this letter?  Do you have a clear memory or is your memory vague about it?  Because if you say you have a clear memory, I'm going to ask you some more questions about the contents of this letter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> I have forgotten some of the facts which were contained in the letter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Fair enough, it's thirteen years ago, not so, it's a long time ago that this happened.  Do you agree?  One tends to forget things.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> One of the things that I have to ask you about is this, we were given to understand that there was a wedding and at this wedding an unknown female person arrived who gave you certain information about Nomasonto, did that ever happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> In regard to that marriage, I was not present, I learnt about the discussion during that wedding, after my son had returned from the Mashiya's family, so they would say much about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I see.  I understand what you say, but then it cannot possibly be correct if somebody stated that you went to Lesotho to go and look for Nomasonto.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> No, I didn't go to Lesotho.</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Just on a point of clarification, you said the wedding was in the Mashiya family, not in her family.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well, that's the point, I'm just clarifying, so it must have been her own parents that went and not this person.  And that's all you can tell us about this whole story?  That's all you know about the disappearance of Nomasonto Mashiya?</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> That is all, Chairperson, I can tell in regard to her disappearance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well, then I have no further questions, thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR VISSER</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Visser.  Mr Mapoma, may I just confirm that I believe you are part of the team that is representing the victims?</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Chairperson, I thank you for that opportunity.  In fact that's an issue that I wanted to raised before the Committee and everybody involved at these hearings.  Chairperson, it is not correct that I am acting for the victims in this particular matter because there are legal representatives who have been appointed by the TRC to act for the victims in this particular matter.  My duty is that of a Leader of Evidence and I consider my responsibility, Chairperson, as to assist the Committee by making sure that whatever evidence is available it is brought before the Committee.  I must, Chairperson, explain that in the process I do speak to the victims.  In fact they come to me to ask for some questions regarding the process itself and in that process then I do communicate to them.  It is not correct to say that I consulted with the victims with a view to presenting evidence from them, that has not happened.  All I did</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a>was to answer questions that come from victims regarding this matter. </p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Chairperson, may I be allowed to say something? It just occurred to me that Mr Mapoma might quite rightly think that I was criticising him, but that wasn't the point at all, although I must tell you that we've been constantly surprised by the way in which the Amnesty process has happened, that you find yourself confronted with multiple opponents for the same victims, but we've let that go by, Chairperson, we haven't made any point and nor are we making any point about it today.  The only point here was that on what seemed to be a crucial issue, among all these people, nobody ever put it to anybody and that is the only point which I was trying to make, it was not meant as criticism against Mr Mapoma.  In any Commission of Inquiry, you always have a Leader of Evidence whose duty, as we understand the law, has always been to assist the Committee either for or against the applicant, although I must say in this process it's always against the applicants, but be that as it may, but I am certainly not criticising Mr Mapoma in the role that he played here and I hope that that will be accepted as not having been criticism about him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We all are in the legal profession.  We execute our duties and whatever obtains during a trial, we take it that it is not referred to me per se, it's just for the execution of the duties.  We appreciate that.  I think you accept that too, Mr Mapoma.</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Chairperson I did not at all take it as a criticism on me, but the import of it Chairperson, what I want to correct, is an impression that is going to be given that the evidence that is given by the victims here is an evidence that is as a result of consultation between the victims and myself ...(indistinct) persons.  I want that to be clear Chairperson, that is not the case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I do appreciate, because we are so to speak in the same stable, I do appreciate that, but would you want to ask some questions here, Mr Mapoma?  I was approaching it actually from that angle because you will recall that the witness Mrs Mokhele, when she said legal representatives, you were in that stable as well, so I just wanted to be absolutely certain.</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Yes, I appreciate that Chairperson, thank you for that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MAPOMA:</span> Mrs Mokhele, before the child was brought to you, did you have any contact with Nomasonto?</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> No, Chairperson, there was no contact.</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> When last did you have contact with Nomasonto, if at all you did have contact with her?  Okay, let me do it this way - sorry Chairperson.  Let me ask you like this.  After Nomasonto left South Africa, did you ever have contact with her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> No, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> And after the child was brought to you, did you ever have contact with her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> No, Chairperson, there was no contact.</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Thank you Chairperson, no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MAPOMA</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Malindi, any re-examination ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> None Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a>NO RE-EXAMINATION BY MR MALINDI</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Members of the Panel, do you have any questions for the witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Just one, Chairperson, from my side.  Did you find out about the child's birth when the child was born, or after the child was born, of after the child was born, before the child was brought to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> No, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So did you not even know that Nomasonto had a child?</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> I did not know Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So it must have been a very big surprise to you when two unknown men arrive at your house with a child and they say:  "This is your son and daughter-in-law's child"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> Yes, Chairperson, that was a surprise.</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Sibanyoni.</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Was your son married to Nomasonto?</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> They were not married legally.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> But you were aware of the relationship between them?   The relationship between Tsietsi and Nomasonto?</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> Yes I knew, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> When these two men brought the child to you, didn't you ask them why they don't take it to the mother's parental home?</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MOKHELE:</span> I just accepted the child.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Thank you no further questions, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Mr Malindi anything arising from what the Panel asked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Nothing Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Mr Visser, anything?</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No thank you Chairperson.</p>

<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Chairperson, I beg leave to call Mrs Mashiya.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> She may take her place next to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">NOSGATI NORAH MASHIYA:</span> (sworn states)</p>

<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR MALINDI:</span> Mrs Mashiya, are you the mother of Nomasonto Mashiya?</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> Yes, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Who is one of the people who are subject of this hearing who disappeared since they went into exile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> That is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> I would like you to tell the Committee when Nomasonto left South Africa for exile.</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> In 1987, I have forgotten, it can be around 1977.</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Since she left for exile, were you able to communicate with her whilst she was outside of South Africa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> Yes, with a letter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I'm terribly sorry, Chairperson, I didn't get the question.  Could it possibly be repeated for me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Could you do that please, Mr Malindi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Sure, Chairperson.  Since Nomasonto left South Africa for exile, were you able to communicate with her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> Yes, Chairperson, through letters she was writing to me, she was writing to us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Do you remember how often she used to write to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> It could have been about four to five times.</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> When was the last time that she communicated with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> I do not remember, but she wrote to us.  I don't know whether it was when she wanted to come back, that's when she told us that she was pregnant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> As far as you can remember, was the last communication when she told you that she was pregnant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> Yes, she did write to us after that.  She continued writing to us, that was not the last time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Then you knew that she was pregnant and did you ever meet the child, if the child was born?</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> No, I did not meet with the child.  I met a woman who came to tell us that Sonti has told her to tell us to go and fetch the child at a certain hotel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Can you tell the Committee more about this woman who came to tell you to fetch the child?  When did she come and what did she tell you and what did you do as a result of what she told you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> This woman came to us on a Saturday, but I forgot the month.  She told us that she'd been told by - that she's been sent by Nomasonto.  She came on Saturday and left the following day, on Sunday.  Sonti had told her that we should go and fetch the child at a certain hotel.  I told her that we do not have the passports, but she told us we can manage to go there using our I.D.'s.  We left the following day, we left to Lesotho and it was the first time that we went to Lesotho.  When we arrived, we could not enter the country using our I.D.s, we were told that we need to use our passports but we ...(indistinct) there, that is at the border gate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> After you were not allowed in, what did you do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> We went back home.  When we arrived at home the two male people arrived with a car late in the afternoon and when they arrived, they told us that they had been sent by Sonti to bring the child and they told us that they have left the child at Mokhele's place.  She had told them that if they were not present at home, they should take the child to the Mokhele family.  They told us that they were sent by Sonti.  We left that night to Mokhele family and when we arrived there, we found the child there and we were also give the letter which was sent together with the child.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Who gave you the letter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> These two people gave us the letter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Did you read the letter before going to the Mokhele family?</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> We read the letter, I gave it to my daughter to read it for me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> And what did the letter say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> It was written in Zulu, but it was read by my daughter.  She's the person who can explain what was written in that letter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Did you yourself see the letter?  Did you see the writing in the letter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> And do you personally know Nomasonto's handwriting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> I cannot read.</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> And then you say you then went to the Mokhele family after these men had been to your house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> Yes, Chairperson, that is myself and my husband, we went to the Mokhele family to see the child.</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> And then when you got there, did you find the child?</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> Yes, Chairperson, the child was there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> After the child - sorry Chairperson, may I rephrase?  The day that these two men came to your house and they gave you this letter and told you that they had left Nomasonto's child with the Mokhele family, did they say they left the child on the same day, or on another day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> Yes, Chairperson, because we had just arrived from Lesotho, they arrived after our arrival from Lesotho.</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> After this child was delivered to the Mokhele family and there had been these meetings between the two families, did Nomasonto ever communicate with you to ask maybe whether you received the child or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> No, Chairperson, she never wrote us a letter after that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> To this day you have not heard from Nomasonto?</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> Yes, Chairperson, we have never heard anything from her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Thank you Chairperson, no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MALINDI</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Malindi.  Mr Visser any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes please, thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR VISSER:</span> Are you Zulu speaking?</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> Yes, but I do understand Sotho.</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And your husband, is he Zulu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> Yes, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Is your family Zulu speaking?</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> Yes, Chairperson, we are Zulu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Was Nomasonto also a Zulu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> Yes, Chairperson, she was my daughter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Now you say that Nomasonto left, as I heard you, for exile in 1987, but it could have been around 1977, is that what you said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> I said 87, not 97.</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Now in 1987, was there a relationship that you knew about between her and Mr Tsietsi Mokhele?</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> Yes, I did know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I see.  And were they then both, Tsietsi as well as Nomasonto, were they then both still in South Africa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> Yes, when I knew about their relationship.</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did Nomasonto have trouble with the police while she was in South Africa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> No, I don't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did the police ever come to your home and harass you at your home?</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> They did not arrest her, but they were looking for her.  They used to come looking for Nomasonto, that is after she had left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> After she had left?</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And did they then search your home?</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> Yes, they would come and search in all the bedrooms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Were they looking for letters?</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> They told us that they were looking for Nomasonto.</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Were they also looking when they were searching, were they looking for letters?</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> They said that they were looking for Nomasonto, they did not lift up the property while they were searching.</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you know that the police intercepted mail during those times when they were looking for people?  Did you know that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> No ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It would be difficult, she's unlettered.  It would be difficult for the witness, she's unlettered.</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I'll accept that Chairperson.  Perhaps it's a matter more for argument, if necessary, than for cross-examination.  When Nomasonto wrote to you, you say you can't read, I take it you also can't write then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you reply to Nomasonto's letters through someone else?  Did your daughter write on your behalf to Nomasonto?</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> No, we did not reply, because we were afraid of the police, we were just receiving the letters from her, we never answered her letters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> So you were aware that there was a danger in writing letters because of the police, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Now did I understand you correctly to say that after Nomasonto left South Africa to exile, she wrote to you four or five times?  Am I correct in what I heard you say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And then at one stage you said, you later corrected it but at one stage you said the last time you received a letter from her was when she was pregnant, do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> No, that was not the last letter, she wrote to us after that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Okay, that's how you corrected it later, but my point is this, were you first informed of the fact that she was present in a letter written by her to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, you used the word present, do you mean pregnant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Pregnant, I'm sorry, did I say present?  Pregnant.  Let me repeat it for you, I don't want to confuse you.  Did you hear for the first time that Nomasonto was pregnant from a letter that she wrote to you telling you that she was pregnant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> Yes, that was the first time that she wrote to us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> How certain are you that she left in 1987?</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I don't think the answer elicited by Mr Malindi was that she was certain, she mentioned a date and said:  "I am not sure".</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, Chairperson, that's why my first question to her was how certain is she when Nomasonto left, because she also said 77.</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, that's right, you may proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Just while you're on there, she also said in reply to your question:  "It wasn't 1997" and you never even said 97, so as far as I can see, she's totally confused and you haven't cleared it up with her.  She used 97 when you said 87 or 77, so just as puzzled.</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well let me try to clear that up.  Can you tell us today from your own recollection, with certainty, when Nomasonto left South Africa to exile, to go into exile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> I think it's 1987.</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Maybe I should ask you this question, ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Could we just have order from audience, she's not being put into a trap and we don't want - I wouldn't and I resent it that when a witness is talking, that the audience would participate or try to correct the witness, please let's have order.  These proceedings are not different from the Court proceedings and I don't want to exercise my rights because this is a different process, but should I be forced to, I think I will.</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.  Mrs Mashiya, are you able to recall years?</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> The question is ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> I do not remember, this happened many years ago, I do not remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> During what year is it presently?</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> Now?  I don't know.  I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you ...(indistinct).  Look, the point is simply this, that Nomasonto's child must have been born around 1986 for him to be almost two years old.  1985 in fact, to be two years old in 1987 when he was brought to Mrs Mokhele, isn't that so?  She must have been pregnant in 1985, that's what I'm putting to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> Well I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Perhaps this might help.  Do you have any idea how long it was that she was in exile when the child arrived?  In other words, how long had she been in exile when the child arrived, how many years was it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> It was many years.  I don't know how many years, but she had been in exile for many years.</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You see, as far as we understand, the child arrived in 1987 and if she'd been in exile for many years, then she must have left many years previous to that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> Yes, I don't know the years, really.</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I'm going to step off this issue, Chairperson, it's not that important.  What did she write to you about when she wrote to you, can you remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> She wrote to us telling us that she was pregnant, but those letters were read to me by my daughter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, what did she in those letters?</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> I do not remember, because I was not the person who was reading those letters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No, with all due respect to you, whether you read it yourself, or whether somebody else read them to you, that's not the issues.  The point is you knew what was in those letters, isn't that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> Yes, I did know then, but I have forgotten.</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That's also fair enough.  Let me try to prod your memory.  Did she write to you and say to you that she had undergone military training?</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did she ever tell you that she had joined MK and that she was an MK soldier?  What's the answer to ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What did MK soldiers do?  What do you think they did?</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> I don't know they were working there, I don't know what they were doing there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Weren't they planting bombs in a country and blowing up places?</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> She did not tell me about that, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Didn't you know that from your own knowledge?</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> No, I don't even know a bomb.</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Are you serious?  Are you absolutely serious that you didn't know that MK was involved in a struggle in this country and that they were fighting a war, didn't you know that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> I knew that they were fighting for liberation, but I did not know about the bombs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright.  So you say on a Saturday a stranger, a woman arrives, I take it at your place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And she says that Nomasonto says you must come and fetch her baby from a hotel in Lesotho.</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You then didn't even know that there was a baby that was born, that was alive, you only heard the last time from her that she was pregnant, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Were you surprised?</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> Yes, I was surprised.</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you inquire from this lady what this was about?  Did you ask her:  "What did Nomasonto say, why must I come and fetch the child?"</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> She said she wanted to go back to school.</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Who?  Nomasonto?</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> But what has that got to do with where the child is?</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> She wanted to bring the child back home, because she wanted to go back to school, that is what this lady said to us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Let me ask you this, were you satisfied with that explanation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> Yes, I did, because I didn't know anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright.  And you then leave for Lesotho, did you go with your husband?</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> Yes, that's correct, with my husband.</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And you're absolutely certain that you had to fetch the child from Lesotho, not from the Free State, from Ladybrand for example?  You had to fetch the child from Lesotho.</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> She said in Lesotho, that's what the woman said to us, at a certain hotel in Lesotho.</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you take the particulars of this person that came to tell you this, in case something went wrong, so that you can contact her again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> No, we did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Didn't it occur to you that due to these strange circumstances, that it's important to know where you could contact this person again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> We were happy that we were going to fetch the child in Lesotho at an hotel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright.  You say she came on a Saturday, she left on a Sunday, you can't remember the month?</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> Yes, I do not remember the month.</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Do you remember the year?</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> I said it was 87.</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> On what day did you leave for Lesotho?  Not the date, just tell me, was it Monday, Tuesday?</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> This woman arrived on Saturday and left on Sunday.  We left on Monday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Are you quite sure of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Is that something you remember well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> We left on Sunday, I think.</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> The Sunday or the Monday?</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> She left on Sunday, we also left on Sunday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> All that I'm asking you is, is this something that you remember well and that you're reasonably certain about, that's all I'm asking you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> I have forgotten about it, but this is what I think, I can't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Oh I see.  Alright.  Well let me put it to you that as we know the facts, also from Mrs Mokhele's evidence, the child was brought to her on the 24th of December.  The 24th of December was a Thursday and you told us, you told this Committee today that the child was brought on the very same day that you came back after you'd gone to Lesotho.  Do you understand what I'm saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> When we came back from Lesotho, when we arrived at home the child was already there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright.  How did you go to Lesotho?  What form of transport did you use?</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> We used the long distance taxi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And you were on your way to an hotel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Give us the name of the hotel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> She told us from the long taxi we will see the hotel, it's not far from the taxi rank.  We will see that hotel, that's what she told us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright, so it's an hotel close to the taxi rank, is that what you're saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did she tell you and did you ask her what Nomasonto was doing at this hotel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> She told us that she was there with a baby.  She was waiting for us there for us to fetch the child there at the hotel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Just staying at the hotel or working there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> She was not working there, she said we'll find her there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Any time you arrived, day or night, you will find her there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> Yes.  That's what we were told.  We left because we knew that we would find her there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you infer from that Nomasonto was living at the hotel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> She was not staying in that hotel, she just said that we'll find her there at the hotel.  This woman told us that Nomasonto was staying at her place in Maseru.</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Why didn't she say:  "Go to Nomasonto's place in Maseru" to pick up the child there?  This is a strange situation, don't you agree?</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It would be difficult for Mr Visser, this is relayed to her.  I think that question would be slightly unfair to her that somebody comes and we should - she should imagine what Nomasonto said to this lady and why she should think that should happen, I think that's unfair.  That's an unfair question, I won't allow that question to this witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> As it pleases you Mr Chairman.  Anyway, you made no further inquiries from this person, you just accepted at face value what she told you and you went off to this hotel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I want you to think back and to tell this Committee when the last time was when you received the four or five letters from Nomasonto which you gave evidence about.  When was the last time that you received a letter from here, can you tell us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> After the child was brought to us, she never wrote to us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> When was the last time, can you tell us?  If you can't just say so.  When was the last time that you received an letter from Nomasonto while she was in exile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> I don't remember, I can't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  But am I correct in drawing the inference from your evidence, that she didn't correspond with you regularly, it happened very seldom over the period of time that she left for exile, is that correct?  It was seldom that she corresponded with you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> She was writing to us regularly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> With all due respect, five letters over many years, what does that signify to you?  That's all on your evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> Yes I think it could be five letters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Over many years, you said many years.</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> Yes, she was writing to us because we used to keep those letters.  We burned those letters after we were being harassed by the police because we realised that they would put us in danger, that's when we burned those letters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Why didn't you then concede that when I asked you whether the police were looking for letters?   When I asked you that, why didn't you say:  "Ja, we burned the letters because we were afraid that the police would get hold of them"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Chairperson, before the witness answers, I don't know if the question is fair.  The witness doesn't know what the police are looking for and I think that was the gist of her answer.  They came looking for Nomasonto mainly and they searched the house.  She doesn't know what they are looking for.  It's not fair to say:  "Why didn't you tell me that they were looking for letters".</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Chairperson, I asked her specifically whether they were looking for letters, there was no issue about it, no question about it, I asked her specifically that question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I do not recall, but I remember, I'm subject to correction, what I remember is that when you said that police were intercepting letters, I said it's unfair, this witness wouldn't know that, but I'm not saying you did not, I'm not staying that, you may restate your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, the other thing she did say in her answer was that they didn't look under beds and cupboards, what have you, they were just looking for her, that's what she said, so it was clear from her evidence that she didn't think they were looking for letters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> The point I was trying to make and the issue that the whole line of questioning was directed at, was that there was a danger connected to corresponding with a person for whom the police were looking.</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Yes, but that was her corresponding with Nomasonto, not Nomasonto corresponding with her.  That was the context within which the letter was asked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Chairperson, with great respect, ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> I'm busy speaking, please don't interrupt me.  When I'm finished then you can say your point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Let's just have some order.  Yes, just finish off.</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, my mike just got cut off and I couldn't finish what I was saying.  The point I'm trying to say is that her evidence on this issue was in relation to the searches, then you went on to a question of did she write back to her and she said:  "No, we didn't write back to her because we were afraid of the police", that's where the issue of the fear then arose, so the two weren't said in the same breath, in the same way.  That's why I'm backing up what the Chairperson says.</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Visser rather than talking about this a lot, I would say, let's start, let's have a build-up to that, I think it would do us more good.</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Chairperson, I'm going to make it easier than that, I'm going to leave that because there's enough on record for the point that I've wanted to make.  It's already on record, in my submission, because how a letter written by this witness to Nomasonto could ever have been a danger is something I don't understand.  One would imagine that it is common sense that if the police came into the house and found a letter written by Nomasonto, the very person for whom they were looking, that would have represented the danger, but Chairperson, I'm not going to go on with that and frankly Chairperson, I have no further questions for this witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR VISSER</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Visser.  Mr Mapoma, do you have any questions for the witness?</p>

<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Yes.  When you left for Lesotho to look for - I mean to fetch the child from Nomasonto, did you return on the same day?</p>

<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">RE-EXAMINATION BY MR MALINDI:</span> Mrs Mashiya, you testified that you knew of the relationship between Nomasonto and Tsietsi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> Yes, I did know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Did you know that Tsietsi went into exile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> Yes, I knew after that he left for exile after.</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> In relation to Tsietsi leaving for exile, when did Nomasonto leave?  How soon after Tsietsi or how long before Tsietsi, or did they leave at the same time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> Nomasonto left first.</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Thank you Chairperson, no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MALINDI</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Panel Members, Mr Lax any questions for the witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Thank you Chair.  There was just one question.  I was puzzled by one of your answers to Mr Visser where you said that the letter that you got telling you that she was pregnant, was the first letter.  Those were the words that were translated, did I understand that correctly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So are you saying that before she fell pregnant, you didn't get other letters from her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> I said this was the last and she wrote to us thereafter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Yes.  But I've just asked you, was this the first letter?  You said yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mrs Mashiya, before Nomasonto fell pregnant, did she write to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> Yes she wrote to us while she was in exile and told us that she was pregnant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, I'm now even more puzzled because the question was before she became pregnant, did she write to you.  You said:  "Yes, she wrote to us when she became pregnant".  Did she write to you before she became pregnant, or was that the first letter you got from here?  That's what I'm trying to understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> Before she told us that she was pregnant, she sent us a Christmas Card.</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And before the Christmas Card, had you had any other letters from her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a><span class="speaker">MRS MASHIYA:</span> Yes, we used to receive letters from her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Thank you Chairperson, that just clarifies that for me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Lax.  Mr Sibanyoni.</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson, I've got no questions.</p>

<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> They used to phone each other.</p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Who used to phone who?</p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> My mother would phone Mbulelo.  I beg your pardon, Mbulelo would phone my mother.</p>

<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> In 1987 I was schooling in Lesotho, we used to meet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> ;   When did you go to Lesotho?</p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> January 1987.</p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Was that the first time, in 1987, that you met him directly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Did you meet him only this once in 1987?</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> No, we met more than once, up until September 1987, when I did not know where he had gone to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> And then after September 1987, was that the last time you saw him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> I saw him again in February, the following year.</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Was that 1988?</p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> When you saw him in February 1988, did he tell you if anything extra ordinary had happened to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes, he told me, he came to my school, he told me that he had a narrow escape and he believed that he will never die again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Did you know what he was referring to when he said he had a narrow escape and if he didn't die, he would never die again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> He didn't explain in details.  I just assumed that he was in some kind of trouble.</p>
<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Did he tell you that he was arrested by the South African Police or the South African Special Branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> No, he never mentioned that to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> After you met him in February, did you hear anything again relating to him, or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> As I used to visit them frequently in Roma, they told me to stop visiting them after February, because the situation was tense there in Roma.  I remained where I was.  Lindelwa's sister came to me in March, telling me that Mbulelo was arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Do you know Lindelwa's surname, the Lindelwa who came to tell you that Mbulelo has been arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes, I know, the surname is Mabece.</p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> And do you know Lindelwa's sister's name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes, I know her name, her name is Nandipa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Who did she say arrested Mbulelo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> With all this hearsay evidence, Chairperson, I will expect at lest my Learned Friend to indicate to you that this person is going to be called.</p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is the position Mr Malindi, because this has what has been related to her.  Are you going to call ...(indistinct)?</p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Chairperson, Lindelwa and Nandipa are some of the witnesses that we have not been able to make available for the hearing.  I will submit Chairperson, that this kind of hearsay evidence be allowed on the basis that I will lay through the witness, that these witnesses, we've been unable to make available to the Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Visser.</p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Chairperson, as we understand the law, a Commission of Inquiry in terms of the Commission's Act, has a very wide range of powers and authority.  They may even hear evidence, although the evidence is hearsay.  We're well aware of that, but when it goes to the crux of the matter, Chairperson, one would expect to hear first-hand evidence.  If one accepts this evidence that this witness is going to give on the basis of which it's tendered as pure hearsay evidence and it is regarded no higher than that, then perhaps I shouldn't have an objection, but certainly, Chairperson, if it's going to be used against the applicant, then we submit that you would require some better evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line546"><a name="pos546"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Obviously the test would kick in Mr Visser.</p>
<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Perhaps I should just leave it and let the witness give the evidence, Chairperson.  After all we're here to reconcile, as your banner says, and to find out what the truth is of the matter, so perhaps we should just leave it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line548"><a name="pos548"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You may proceed Mr Malindi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The question was, did she tell you which Police it was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Thank you Chairperson.  Did she tell you which Police arrested Mbulelo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes, she told me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> As a result of the information that Mbulelo had been arrested, were any steps taken by the family?</p>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> I went to the offices of the United Nations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> With what purpose?</p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> I wanted them to assist me in looking for Mbulelo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Were you or the family ever then brought to a situation where you found out what happened to Mbulelo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> No we never heard a thing thereafter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Where your brother stayed, did you know who else he stayed with or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> He was staying with  Mbilo Makwageza and Fana.</p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> And after you got this report that he was arrested, you never heard anything - or did you hear anything from him ever again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> We never heard anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Thank you Chairperson, no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MALINDI</p>
<p class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Any cross-examination, Mr Visser?</p>
<p class="line" id="line566"><a name="pos566"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR VISSER:</span> Mbulelo left in 1980, is that correct, to go into exile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line568"><a name="pos568"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> The purpose was that he was joining, as you say in paragraph 4 at page 35 of the bundle</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line570"><a name="pos570"></a>"To join the African National Congress in exile",</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a>is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Do you know whether he joined Umkhonto weSizwe and became a soldier?</p>
<p class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes, I know that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> While he was in Lesotho, what was his function there?  What was he doing as far as Umkhonto weSizwe was concerned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGONO:</span> As a person who is not a member, I was not in a position to know his activities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Would you accept that he was planning to execute attacks on, well attacks in South Africa, would you accept that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> If it was their duty to do so, maybe that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  It was put here by somebody that he was involved in an attack on police in the Transkei.  Do you know about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> I heard that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Do you also know that he was arrested by the South African Police in Qwa-Qwa, as it was put here to one of my applicants?</p>
<p class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> No, I do not know that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> He never told you about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> No, not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line585"><a name="pos585"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Chairperson, my attorney is just telling me that I might be again, and this is the third time, confusing K K with Tax, so I withdraw that question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line586"><a name="pos586"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Forget the question that was asked and as well as your answer Ms Ngono.  You may proceed, Mr Visser.</p>
<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you Chairperson.  Now as I understand your evidence today, Ms Ngono, you said that since he left in 1980 there was contact with him in 1985 when your mother went to visit him in the Transkei, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line588"><a name="pos588"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line589"><a name="pos589"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Now I don't quite understand this.  I thought you said he left the country, that is South Africa, to go into exile.  Did he then leave for the Transkei in 1980?</p>
<p class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He was in the Transkei in 1985.</p>
<p class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That's why I'm asking her whether he left in 1980 to go to the Transkei.  Where did he go to in 1980, as far as you know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> He went to exile.</p>
<p class="line" id="line593"><a name="pos593"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Where?</p>
<p class="line" id="line594"><a name="pos594"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> I have never been to exile, I don't know where he had gone to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, you see, exile isn't a place, you go into exile to a place to get away from another place.  You don't know where he went?</p>
<p class="line" id="line596"><a name="pos596"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> I do not know where he went to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line597"><a name="pos597"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright.  Did your mother not tell you in 1985 that she was going to visit Ngono in the Transkei, or did she tell you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line598"><a name="pos598"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> She told me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line599"><a name="pos599"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You see then I don't understand your paragraph 5.  First of all, can the bundle page 35 to 37 be shown to you please and I want to ask you whether you recognise this document at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line600"><a name="pos600"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes, I know this document.</p>
<p class="line" id="line601"><a name="pos601"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Is this a statement that was made by you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line602"><a name="pos602"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line603"><a name="pos603"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> On the 8th of March of this year, 2000?</p>
<p class="line" id="line604"><a name="pos604"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line605"><a name="pos605"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And who was this person, Mr Mbete that says he took the statement?  Who is he?  Where does he fit in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line606"><a name="pos606"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> This was a TRC investigator.</p>
<p class="line" id="line607"><a name="pos607"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright.  And did you tell him what is contained in this document?</p>
<p class="line" id="line608"><a name="pos608"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Please repeat your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line609"><a name="pos609"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you tell him that which is contained in this document?  Is that what you told him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line610"><a name="pos610"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line611"><a name="pos611"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And was the document then typed after you told him what you know of this matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line612"><a name="pos612"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes, that is correct.  Perhaps it was typed thereafter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line613"><a name="pos613"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  Was it read back to you to confirm that he got his notes of what you said, correctly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line614"><a name="pos614"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> It was never read to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line615"><a name="pos615"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well let me ask you this then.  You signed this document that is contained at page 35 to 37, did you sign any statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line616"><a name="pos616"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> After the document was typed, I was never given a chance to sign.  As he was taking the statement from me, he was writing on a rough paper.</p>
<p class="line" id="line617"><a name="pos617"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Now if this document says:  "We never heard from him", that's Mbulelo and I'm adding since 1980 when he left for exile, "until 1987, when my later mother, Nancy Miseka Ngono, visited him in Lesotho, would that be correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line618"><a name="pos618"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Chairperson, the witness has just indicated that there's a problem with her translation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line619"><a name="pos619"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> She must take her hand off the front of that thing.  If she closes those two buttons there won't be any sound.</p>
<p class="line" id="line620"><a name="pos620"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Let me repeat the question to you, if the document which purports to be a statement made by you, says in paragraph 4, read together with paragraph 5, that after 1980 when Mbulelo left for exile to join the ANC, you never heard from him again until 1987, would that be correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line621"><a name="pos621"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> No, that statement is not true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line622"><a name="pos622"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Because of what you told us today, that your mother went to visit him in 1985?</p>
<p class="line" id="line623"><a name="pos623"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line624"><a name="pos624"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Who is this relative who brought the message to you about the telephone call from Mbulelo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line625"><a name="pos625"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> It's back at home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line626"><a name="pos626"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright.  Now please explain this to me, because I don't quite understand.   Did you receive letters from Mbulelo after 1980, either you or your mother or your sister.</p>
<p class="line" id="line627"><a name="pos627"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> He once wrote a letter to my mother, but most of the time he would call her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line628"><a name="pos628"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Right, through this relative?</p>
<p class="line" id="line629"><a name="pos629"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line630"><a name="pos630"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And when did these calls start?  Can you remember?  After 1980, when did he start calling your mother?</p>
<p class="line" id="line631"><a name="pos631"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> I think he started in 1985.</p>
<p class="line" id="line632"><a name="pos632"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> 1985.  Yes.  So is it fair to say that since he left in 1980, there were long periods of time that you heard nothing from him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line633"><a name="pos633"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes, there was a time when he was very quiet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line634"><a name="pos634"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> In 1987 who visited him in Lesotho, that is Mbulelo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line635"><a name="pos635"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> It's my mother and my sister.</p>
<p class="line" id="line636"><a name="pos636"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Not yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line637"><a name="pos637"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> I was already in Lesotho at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line638"><a name="pos638"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Listen to my question please.  You are telling this Committee about a visit that took place in 1987 where your mother went to visit Mbulelo, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line639"><a name="pos639"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Please repeat your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line640"><a name="pos640"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You're telling this Committee about an occasion in 1987 when your mother visited Mbulelo in Lesotho, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line641"><a name="pos641"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line642"><a name="pos642"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And you say she was accompanied by your sister on that visit, on that occasion, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line643"><a name="pos643"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line644"><a name="pos644"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Now I'm asking you, did you visit with your mother and your sister, Mbulelo, on that occasion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line645"><a name="pos645"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes, I was also present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line646"><a name="pos646"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Why didn't you tell the Committee about that, that you were also present?  You told us that only your mother and your sister went to visit him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line647"><a name="pos647"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> I used to see him all the time, I didn't see the point of mentioning that again.  I have already mentioned that I was in Lesotho at the time of their visit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line648"><a name="pos648"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well, seeing that you were there, what was talked about with Mbulelo at the time, between your mother and him, your sister and him, yourself and him?  What did you talk about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line649"><a name="pos649"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> They were just looking at him.  They just went there to visit him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line650"><a name="pos650"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did they talk about normal things, family matters and so on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line651"><a name="pos651"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> He was asking them about family matters, because he hasn't seen them for a very long time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line652"><a name="pos652"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Was he telling them and yourself about what he was doing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line653"><a name="pos653"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> No, he never mentioned that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line654"><a name="pos654"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> But you knew he was an MK soldier and he had been military trained, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line655"><a name="pos655"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes, we knew that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line656"><a name="pos656"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> When in 1987, did this visit take place, can you tell us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line657"><a name="pos657"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Though I cannot remember well, I think it was during the month of June.</p>
<p class="line" id="line658"><a name="pos658"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> June.  Did he mention at all his intention to go away from Lesotho at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line659"><a name="pos659"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> No, he never mentioned that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line660"><a name="pos660"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  So were you surprised in September when you didn't hear from him again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line661"><a name="pos661"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> He just disappeared but I didn't inquire, but his other comrades were around and I would see them all the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line662"><a name="pos662"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That's not the question.  When you didn't hear from Mbulelo in September 1987, did that surprise you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line663"><a name="pos663"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> No, I was never surprised.</p>
<p class="line" id="line664"><a name="pos664"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, because he was going on missions and he would leave without telling you where he was going, isn't that the reason?</p>
<p class="line" id="line665"><a name="pos665"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line666"><a name="pos666"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  You see the one thing I don't understand, you must please tell us whether this is right or wrong, paragraph 7 of this statement of yours, at page 36 of the bundle, says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line667"><a name="pos667"></a>"After that visit,"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line668"><a name="pos668"></a>now we know that's in June 1987,</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line669"><a name="pos669"></a>"we never saw him again until we learned in 1988 that he had disappeared."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line670"><a name="pos670"></a>Is that statement correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line671"><a name="pos671"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> No, that is not true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line672"><a name="pos672"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Can you explain why this has been put into a statement that pretends to be your statement?  Can you explain that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line673"><a name="pos673"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> I'll read it to you</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line674"><a name="pos674"></a>"After that visit we never saw him again until we learned in 1988 that he had disappeared in Roma and Lesotho."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line675"><a name="pos675"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, the question is, can you explain why that appears in your statement, it's been a long time since the question was asked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line676"><a name="pos676"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> I think it is an error  a misprint.</p>
<p class="line" id="line677"><a name="pos677"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well, alright. And while we're at that paragraph, if you read on it says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line678"><a name="pos678"></a>"Where he was together with his girlfriend, Lindelwa Mabece",</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line679"><a name="pos679"></a>do you see that there?  Is that correct, or is that also wrong, a misprint?</p>
<p class="line" id="line680"><a name="pos680"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> On the day of his arrest, he was with Lindelwa Mabece, that is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line681"><a name="pos681"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Is that what you were told by Mabece's sister in that conversation which you told us about earlier?</p>
<p class="line" id="line682"><a name="pos682"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> She told me that it was herself, Lindelwa Mabece, Nandipa Mabece and Mbulelo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line683"><a name="pos683"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  Is that why you stated that in this paragraph, it's because of what she told you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line684"><a name="pos684"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> I don't understand when you are saying that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line685"><a name="pos685"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well you know it's very simple really, you don't have personal knowledge of this, do you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line686"><a name="pos686"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> They came to tell me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line687"><a name="pos687"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That's what I'm asking you.  Thank you.  Now you don't intend to say in that paragraph that Mbulelo was living with his girlfriend, do you, or are you saying that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line688"><a name="pos688"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Mbulelo was staying in so many places.</p>
<p class="line" id="line689"><a name="pos689"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you.  Because you see, the reason why I ask you is there seems to be a bit of confusion here as to whether he was living with his girlfriend or whether he was living in another house.  Can you tell us what the position was? You also said today that he was living with Mbilo and Fana, as I heard you, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line690"><a name="pos690"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> May you repeat your question Mr Visser?</p>
<p class="line" id="line691"><a name="pos691"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Perhaps to make it brief, as far as you're concerned, Mbulelo lived with Mpilo and what I heard you to say, Fana, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line692"><a name="pos692"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes, that is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line693"><a name="pos693"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> As far as you're aware, he wasn't living with Lindelwa Mabece?</p>
<p class="line" id="line694"><a name="pos694"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> All I know is that he used to visit Lindelwa as his girlfriend.</p>
<p class="line" id="line695"><a name="pos695"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I'll take it that that's an affirmation.  Now, you see this misprint is very confusing in paragraph 7 because you see it says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line696"><a name="pos696"></a>"after that visit in 1987, we never saw him again until we learned in 1988 that he had disappeared"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line697"><a name="pos697"></a>and today you told this Committee that after February 1988 you were told by them to stop visiting them, I take it that them is Mabece and Mbulelo, am I correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line698"><a name="pos698"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Please repeat your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line699"><a name="pos699"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you give evidence today to say that after February 1988 you were told by them to stop visiting them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line700"><a name="pos700"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> He did not say that in February, and it was not himself and Lindelwa, Lindelwa was just a girlfriend, she was not involved in Mbulelo's activities, it was himself and Mbilo who told me to stop visiting them in Roma.</p>
<p class="line" id="line701"><a name="pos701"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright.  He told you that personally, face to face?  He didn't send a message to you, you spoke to him and he told you that, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line702"><a name="pos702"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes, they told me so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line703"><a name="pos703"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Would you agree with me that if that is so, this sentence cannot be correct?</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line704"><a name="pos704"></a>"After that visit in 1987, we never saw him again until 1988",</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line705"><a name="pos705"></a>that's in direct conflict, do you agree with me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line706"><a name="pos706"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> What I disagree with is the fact that you say we never heard of him after 1988.  I saw him in February of 1988.</p>
<p class="line" id="line707"><a name="pos707"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line708"><a name="pos708"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I don't think you follow.  If we have regard to page 35, what counsel is asking you, that if you look at paragraph 5 up to paragraph 7, there's no flow.  Would I be correct, Mr Visser?</p>
<p class="line" id="line709"><a name="pos709"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well there's no mention of her seeing him at all, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line710"><a name="pos710"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Just to put it a different way, what's being suggested to you is that this paragraph is incorrect, in other words, what it reads is as if you never saw him from 1985 ever again.  In other words - sorry, I beg your pardon, from 1987 ever again.  Okay?  And clearly on the strength of what you've told us that's not correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line711"><a name="pos711"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> That is not true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line712"><a name="pos712"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You see there's also another possibility and that is that what you said in your statement was in fact true and that you thought of this visit in 1988 afterwards, that that's an afterthought.</p>
<p class="line" id="line713"><a name="pos713"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, what visit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line714"><a name="pos714"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> The visit where she was told by him and Mbilo not to visit them any further or any longer in Roma.</p>
<p class="line" id="line715"><a name="pos715"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> When you used the visit, she was at school in Maseru at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line716"><a name="pos716"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I asked her specifically whether he'd sent a message or whether this was a face to face meeting with Mbulelo where she was told not to visit him any longer, and she said:  "He told me personally".</p>
<p class="line" id="line717"><a name="pos717"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You're taking offence far too quickly, we're talking at cross-purposes.  We're on the same page actually, we're saying the same thing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line718"><a name="pos718"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think the way you put it, it's correct thus far, up to this sentence.  You may proceed Mr Visser, I'm with you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line719"><a name="pos719"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I just want to be careful not to be misleading as far as the witness is concerned.  Frankly I don't understand what the problem is, we are certainly at cross purposes, I'm not quite sure.  Let me make it as simple as possible.  You told us that Mbulelo told you in 1988, after February 1988 not to visit him any more or any longer in Roma, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line720"><a name="pos720"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> That is not true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line721"><a name="pos721"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well then would you please explain to us what that evidence of yours means?  Did you receive an instruction not to visit him any longer in Roma after February 1988, or didn't you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line722"><a name="pos722"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> In 1987, from 1987 up to 1988, there was this raid in Lesotho where the helicopters were always surveiling the place and then they told me not to visit them, but Mbulelo disappeared in September, I did not see him during that period.</p>
<p class="line" id="line723"><a name="pos723"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Now ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line724"><a name="pos724"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I don't think that's what counsel asked you.  You said in September he disappeared and reappeared in 1988 and you visited him regularly thereafter.  Somewhere, we don't now when, in 1988 he said you should not visit them again because the situation was bad.  You see, it's after the return from 1987, September, when he left, he came back, you saw him in February 1988 and you visited him and at some stage he told you:  "Don't visit us any more, the situation is bad", that's where you are asked about.  Just put that out of your mind.  He says, in 1988 after February, when Mbulelo reappeared in Lesotho, you visited him again and there he told you that:  "Do not come again, do not visit us", I don't know who is the us, "the situation is bad".  Do you follow what I'm trying to explain to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line725"><a name="pos725"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes, I understand that.  The problem with Mr Visser is that I was no longer visiting him, but Mbulelo came to me in February after his reappearance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line726"><a name="pos726"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, he's got no problem, he's merely asking you questions.  Don't take it that he's got a problem, we just want to clarify certain things which are not clear to him, so don't take it as a problem.  You are under my protection.  If he can come with something which is not right, I'll protect you and Mr Malindi too, he's there, so you've got double protection, so don't worry, just answer what he's asking you.  Okay?</p>
<p class="line" id="line727"><a name="pos727"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Let's try again. Let me start off by saying, Ms Ngono, that I have an understanding that is difficult to remember what happened 13 years ago and I have sympathy with a person that tells me that he can't remember finer detail and dates etc., I am not criticising you, if there are things that you can't remember.  Do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line728"><a name="pos728"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line729"><a name="pos729"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You see the problem which I have here, which I don't understand, is I have a document in front of me which is supposed to be a statement which you made, do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line730"><a name="pos730"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, if you nod your head...</p>
<p class="line" id="line731"><a name="pos731"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes, I understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line732"><a name="pos732"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And that document is in conflict in some respects with what you told us today, do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line733"><a name="pos733"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes, I understand that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line734"><a name="pos734"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What I'm trying to do is to give you an opportunity to explain what the true situation was, if you can remember.  Do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line735"><a name="pos735"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line736"><a name="pos736"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Will you please tell us if there's something that I ask you which you can't remember?  Will you do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line737"><a name="pos737"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line738"><a name="pos738"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Fine.  This request by Mbulelo that you must not visit them in Roma any longer, could he have given you that request before he left in September, 1987?  I'll tell you why I ask you that, so that you understand, it's because if your answer to that is yes, then your paragraph 7 is also correct, then it's not wrong, that's why I'm asking you that question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line739"><a name="pos739"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line740"><a name="pos740"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> So your no, does that mean it was not before September, but it was after he had left in September 1987 that he requested you not to visit them any longer?  How certain are you - let me put it this way, I see that you're confused.  How certain are you that the request was made to you in 1988 and not in 1987, not to visit them any longer in Roma?</p>
<p class="line" id="line741"><a name="pos741"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> It is solely because I'm the one who was told.</p>
<p class="line" id="line742"><a name="pos742"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Is that the best answer you've got?  Alright, let's go on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line743"><a name="pos743"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, she hasn't really answered your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line744"><a name="pos744"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I'm asking her whether that's the best answer she's got because I don't understand the answer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line745"><a name="pos745"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Chairperson, the answer may not have been adequate, but the answer was:  "Because it was said to me, that's why I remember it."  I don't know if that was translated, I was listening to the Xhosa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line746"><a name="pos746"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> That's why I remember it wasn't translated, but anyway ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line747"><a name="pos747"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Perhaps we can just let the ritual of the bell tolling go past before we go on Chairperson.  I don't know whether I didn't count all the tolls this time, but it went very quickly this morning, it seems.  The question is this.  I'm going to put it to you again.  How certain are you that the request and you know which request I'm talking about, was made to you in 1988 and not in 1987?</p>
<p class="line" id="line748"><a name="pos748"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> It is because before his disappearance in September, I used to see him frequently, there was no problem.</p>
<p class="line" id="line749"><a name="pos749"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Are you, as you are sitting here today, convinced that you saw Mbulelo Ngono in Lesotho, alive and well, in February 1988?  Is that your evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line750"><a name="pos750"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line751"><a name="pos751"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> He - was it at that time that he told you that he had a narrow escape?</p>
<p class="line" id="line752"><a name="pos752"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes, that was during that period.</p>
<p class="line" id="line753"><a name="pos753"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Do you know of an incident where he was involved at a road block in Lesotho where he was shot at, fired upon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line754"><a name="pos754"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> I heard so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line755"><a name="pos755"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Do you think that's what he was referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line756"><a name="pos756"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line757"><a name="pos757"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Do you have any idea what he was referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line758"><a name="pos758"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> No, I have no idea.</p>
<p class="line" id="line759"><a name="pos759"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> But the fact is that things were in your words, or as it was translated, were tight in Lesotho for members of MK at the time, isn't that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line760"><a name="pos760"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes, I said so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line761"><a name="pos761"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Was that because the Lesotho police and the Lesotho Defence Force were weeding out the MK members in Lesotho?  Were looking for them to export them - deport them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line762"><a name="pos762"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> I do not think they were trying to deport them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line763"><a name="pos763"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well, Ms Ngono, with great respect, you were friendly with members of MK such as Mpilo and your brother.  Do you really want to tell us that you don't know that supporters or refugees, supporters of the ANC and refugees from South Africa were not deported from Lesotho after December 1986?  Is that what you're telling us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line764"><a name="pos764"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> I do not understand what you are saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line765"><a name="pos765"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You don't know of members of MK that were deported from Lesotho in 1987 when you were there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line766"><a name="pos766"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Untrained members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line767"><a name="pos767"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line768"><a name="pos768"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Untrained members.  Perhaps that was referring to untrained members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line769"><a name="pos769"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well, let's not confuse the issue.  Do you know of any supporters of the ANC who were deported, and I'm not asking you whether you know the people, I want to know whether you know of the fact that ANC supporters were deported from Lesotho in 1987?  Do you or don't you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line770"><a name="pos770"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> I never heard such.</p>
<p class="line" id="line771"><a name="pos771"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Never heard about it?  Okay, never heard about it.  Do you know that the Lesotho police arrested ANC supporters in Lesotho?</p>
<p class="line" id="line772"><a name="pos772"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes, I know that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line773"><a name="pos773"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And what did they then do with them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line774"><a name="pos774"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> What I know of the people that I saw being arrested, they were later released.</p>
<p class="line" id="line775"><a name="pos775"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And there was a military government in Lesotho in 1987, I was just wondering whether I was correct with my dates, but it is confirmed, it was 86, 87 until the end of 1988 thereabouts.  I think it's a fair question.  There was a military government in Lesotho in 1987, isn't that correct?  Do you know that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line776"><a name="pos776"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> I know nothing about those governments.</p>
<p class="line" id="line777"><a name="pos777"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright.  In fairness to you, can I ask you this, it seems as if you weren't terribly interested in the politics of the time, would that be correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line778"><a name="pos778"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line779"><a name="pos779"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright.  Fine, then I won't ask you any further questions about that.  You see the only reason why things had become, I think your translation was tight, or as the Chairman said bad for MK members in Lesotho, I'm putting it to you, was because the military government in Lesotho was well-disposed to the then South African Government and they worked together to try to locate and arrest MK members and that's why things were tight for them, or bad for them, do you agree with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line780"><a name="pos780"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> I agree with you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line781"><a name="pos781"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> From your own knowledge how many times was Mbulelo arrested by any police force?</p>
<p class="line" id="line782"><a name="pos782"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> I heard for the first time that he was arrested in March.</p>
<p class="line" id="line783"><a name="pos783"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You hadn't heard of him being arrested in the Transkei for example?</p>
<p class="line" id="line784"><a name="pos784"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> I did not hear because Mbulelo would not tell me that he was arrested, but he would tell me that he escaped from something, but he would not explain or give me the details.</p>
<p class="line" id="line785"><a name="pos785"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright.  Do you know on how many occasions Mbulelo escaped from something, as you put it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line786"><a name="pos786"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> When I arrived in January, he told me that he was about to die, I must study and then he disappeared in September and when he came back he told me that since he did not die at that time, he will never die again, because he had this narrow escape.</p>
<p class="line" id="line787"><a name="pos787"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> But he didn't tell you what the narrow escape was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line788"><a name="pos788"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> No, because he was very secretive and he was loyal to his organisation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line789"><a name="pos789"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And you didn't ask him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line790"><a name="pos790"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> No, because he would not trust me even though I am his sister.  He would not tell me the ...(indistinct) about the organisation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line791"><a name="pos791"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Where exactly did you see Mbulelo in 1988, where was it that you saw him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line792"><a name="pos792"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> He came to me at school</p>
<p class="line" id="line793"><a name="pos793"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Where was this school, in Maseru or where?</p>
<p class="line" id="line794"><a name="pos794"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> In Masithe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line795"><a name="pos795"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> How far is that from Maseru, is it some distance away or is it close to Maseru?</p>
<p class="line" id="line796"><a name="pos796"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> It is some distance away, on the way to Mafikeng.</p>
<p class="line" id="line797"><a name="pos797"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> So you say you go to the offices of the United Nations, I take it that's in Maseru?</p>
<p class="line" id="line798"><a name="pos798"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line799"><a name="pos799"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And you asked them to assist you to look for Mbulelo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line800"><a name="pos800"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line801"><a name="pos801"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you know what Mbulelo's MK name was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line802"><a name="pos802"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes, I knew.</p>
<p class="line" id="line803"><a name="pos803"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well will you tell us what it was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line804"><a name="pos804"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Msizwa and K K .</p>
<p class="line" id="line805"><a name="pos805"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Msizwa and K K.  When did you go to the United Nations Offices?</p>
<p class="line" id="line806"><a name="pos806"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> In March but I cannot remember the date.</p>
<p class="line" id="line807"><a name="pos807"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Now I'm going to ask you this.  Why did you go to them in March 1988?  What made you go to them in March 1988?</p>
<p class="line" id="line808"><a name="pos808"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> It is because I knew by then that he was arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line809"><a name="pos809"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Who told you that?  I'm sorry, is that because the sister told you that he was arrested, is that the reason?  The sister of Mbece told you that he was arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line810"><a name="pos810"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes, she told me that he was arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line811"><a name="pos811"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And that's why you went to the United Nations offices, am I understanding your evidence correctly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line812"><a name="pos812"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line813"><a name="pos813"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Why didn't you go to the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line814"><a name="pos814"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> It is because Lindelwa went to the police and she asked for a record of the people that were arrested on that date and Mbulelo's name was not on that record.</p>
<p class="line" id="line815"><a name="pos815"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Now did Lindelwa tell you that?  How do you know that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line816"><a name="pos816"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> There were other cadres that were around in Lesotho and they would tell me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line817"><a name="pos817"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> So you can't remember who told you that, is that what you're saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line818"><a name="pos818"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> His name was Mamawa then, but I do not know his real name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line819"><a name="pos819"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> On the strength of what he told you, you decided not to go to the police, the Lesotho police, but to the United Nations, is that what your evidence is?</p>
<p class="line" id="line820"><a name="pos820"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> They said that they would send Lindelwa to go and look for him at a police station in Lesotho and I must go to the United Nations Offices.</p>
<p class="line" id="line821"><a name="pos821"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> So was it then because of that agreement that you went to the United Nations offices, is that the reason why you went there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line822"><a name="pos822"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> They said it would only be a mother that was able to go to the police and look for her child, so I must not go there because the police were cruel, they were able to kill the members of the family, so they did not want me to go to the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line823"><a name="pos823"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Do you know a person by the name of Buthelezi?  Well, if I ask you that of course you're going to say yes, because there are plenty of Buthelezis.  I don't know his name, but his initials are B B Buthelezi and there's a document of confidential comments which he made which is at page 53.  Do you know who that person is?</p>
<p class="line" id="line824"><a name="pos824"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> I do not know that person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line825"><a name="pos825"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Oh, I see.  ...(indistinct)  I see on the last page, I missed that, my client has just pointed it out.  Busisiwe Benedikatha Buthelezi, do you know him, Major?</p>
<p class="line" id="line826"><a name="pos826"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> No, I do not know that person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line827"><a name="pos827"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Chairperson, if I may just correct?  This Busisiwe name, is a female name, it's a Xhosa feminine gender name, this must be a female, this Major, just for the record.</p>
<p class="line" id="line828"><a name="pos828"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well, Chairperson, now we know that as well.  Do you know such a lady person with that name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line829"><a name="pos829"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> No, I do not know her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line830"><a name="pos830"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I'm indebted to my Learned Friend, Mr Mapoma.  Now I want to proceed to page 37 and paragraph 13.  Where were you in 1990?</p>
<p class="line" id="line831"><a name="pos831"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> I was at home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line832"><a name="pos832"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Will you tell us where that is?</p>
<p class="line" id="line833"><a name="pos833"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Port Elizabeth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line834"><a name="pos834"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Where is the Louis le Grange police station?  In which town is that situated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line835"><a name="pos835"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> In Port Elizabeth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line836"><a name="pos836"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Now you didn't give any evidence about that, but it's in this document which professes to be your statement, that a certain Bulelo visited you at home and he told you something, now is that correct or not that such a person visited you in 1990?</p>
<p class="line" id="line837"><a name="pos837"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes, that is correct.  That person came to see my mother.</p>
<p class="line" id="line838"><a name="pos838"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright.  Were you there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line839"><a name="pos839"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line840"><a name="pos840"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you hear what was said by Bulelo to your mother?</p>
<p class="line" id="line841"><a name="pos841"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> This person did not want us to hear what they were talking about with my mother, but when this person left, my mother told us that this person had Mbulelo's photo and this photo was shown to my mother and he did not want us to see this photo, he said that Mbulelo was arrested and he was in the Transkei.</p>
<p class="line" id="line842"><a name="pos842"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> In 1990?</p>
<p class="line" id="line843"><a name="pos843"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes, it was in 1990.</p>
<p class="line" id="line844"><a name="pos844"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mbulelo was in the Transkei in 1990, is that your impression of...?</p>
<p class="line" id="line845"><a name="pos845"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> In the Transvaal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line846"><a name="pos846"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Oh.  As far as you are concerned therefore, can we accept that as far as your information that you got from your mother is concerned, Mbulelo Ngono was in the Transvaal in 1990, is that what you're telling us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line847"><a name="pos847"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> According to what that person said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line848"><a name="pos848"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And there was a photo of him that your mother told you about that was shown to her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line849"><a name="pos849"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line850"><a name="pos850"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And did he also tell your mother that there was a file of Mbulelo at the Louis le Grange police station?</p>
<p class="line" id="line851"><a name="pos851"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes, he said so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line852"><a name="pos852"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> So if you were to be asked what the purpose of the visit of Mr Bobelo to your mother was, would you say that the purpose was to come and tell her that Mbulelo Ngono is alive and well and he's in the Transvaal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line853"><a name="pos853"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line854"><a name="pos854"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Can I ask you this, Ms Ngono, are you opposed to amnesty being granted to the applicants in this case, in terms of the Act?</p>
<p class="line" id="line855"><a name="pos855"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes, I'm opposed to the application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line856"><a name="pos856"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line857"><a name="pos857"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> It is because they did not tell us the truth.  These are our people, we are looking for them, we want them.  If they are killed we want them, we want to know what happened to them.  At home we are left alone and there are three of us, we want our people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line858"><a name="pos858"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Why do you say are they not telling the truth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line859"><a name="pos859"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> It is because ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line860"><a name="pos860"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ms Ngono please, just hold it for a second.  I say I'm now becoming cross about these cell phones. Those who are interested to be in this hearing, must please ensure that it never triggers off and if people feel that they've got to receive some messages whilst here, they should do so outside, wait outside until they get such messages.  It's very distracting because we are listening to very sensitive evidence here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line861"><a name="pos861"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> From my side, Chairperson, your comments are highly appreciated.  I understand your anxiety and I understand the depth of your feelings about your loved ones, I'm not asking you about that.  I would like to know why you think that these people have lied to this Committee.  They say they took those people, including Mbulelo, from Lesotho.  Those people became informers, they're not even sure whether Mbulelo did become an informer, they took them back to Lesotho and they would have heard from them again.  You say they're lying.  Your evidence is that you saw him in February and you never heard from him again.  Nobody is saying you're lying.  Why do you say they are lying?  That's what I want to know from you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line862"><a name="pos862"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> The reason why I'm saying that they are lying is because these dates that they mentioned, Mbulelo was not in Lesotho at that time.  They say that they took him in December and Mbulelo was not in Lesotho in December, Mbulelo came back to Lesotho in February and the Mafikeng incident happened and I heard that he was arrested in March and I never saw him again, that is why I'm saying that they are lying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line863"><a name="pos863"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> How do you know that he wasn't in Lesotho in December?</p>
<p class="line" id="line864"><a name="pos864"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> I used to visit where he was staying, even when he was not there, I would go there and visit Mpilo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line865"><a name="pos865"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You see nobody has ever suggested, on the part of the applicants, that Mbulelo was not arrested in February or March 1988, they never said so, in fact they conceded that its possible, so we're not arguing about that, we're not saying that you're wrong that he was arrested in February or March.  What they are saying is that they took him, they abducted him in December.  You say he wasn't there in December.  I ask you why you say so, you say because you regularly visited and he wasn't there, you didn't find him, is that the picture?</p>
<p class="line" id="line866"><a name="pos866"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes, I know the last time I saw him was in September and even when he was not there, I would visit that place where he was staying and I would find Mpilo and Mpilo would have told me if anything happened to Mbulelo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line867"><a name="pos867"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You see that's why I asked you this question before.  Would you be told if Mr Mbulelo had been arrested by any police force and you said he was very secretive, he wouldn't tell you, remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line868"><a name="pos868"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> The question was, would Mbulelo have told you, not would Mpilo have told you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line869"><a name="pos869"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I know that, I know that Chairperson, with respect, I'm not being unfair to this witness.  you remember that I asked you before whether Mbulelo would have told you if he'd been arrested by any police force, do you remember that I asked you that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line870"><a name="pos870"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes, I remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line871"><a name="pos871"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Do you remember that you said that he wouldn't have told you because he was very secretive.</p>
<p class="line" id="line872"><a name="pos872"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Chairperson, that is not how I remember the evidence.  The answer was:  "He never told me he was ever arrested", except this incident that she testified about.  The secretiveness of Mbulelo comes to his other activities as a member of MK.</p>
<p class="line" id="line873"><a name="pos873"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I'm not going to argue about that Chairperson.  I believe that I'm correct, but I'm going to let it ride.  The point is you now say that if something had happened to him, Mpilo would have told you, is that what you're saying now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line874"><a name="pos874"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes, that is what I'm saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line875"><a name="pos875"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well, alright.  What did he tell you where was Mbulelo in September 1987?</p>
<p class="line" id="line876"><a name="pos876"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Mpilo would not tell me about their operation, but he would tell me only if Mbulelo was taken by the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line877"><a name="pos877"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well you know, with all due respect to you, why wouldn't he tell you that your brother Mbulelo is not in Lesotho, he's in the Transkei or wherever, why wouldn't he tell you that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line878"><a name="pos878"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Because I was not a member of the MK.</p>
<p class="line" id="line879"><a name="pos879"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No, that's not good enough, with respect.  why would he tell you that he was arrested, but tell you nothing else about your brother?</p>
<p class="line" id="line880"><a name="pos880"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Because if he was arrested, that would mean that the family would be involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line881"><a name="pos881"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Visser, I don't know where this is going to.  If we have to accept that the police operated on a need to know basis and we would question a witness and say a witness was not a member of any organisation, they would tell about what happens to them, what they do on a daily basis, then I'm going to find it difficult even to believe the applications that some of the things they did, they wouldn't know.  I would find it very difficult.</p>
<p class="line" id="line882"><a name="pos882"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Point taken, Chairperson.  I will leave that.  Point taken.  Were you ever told by anyone of other times when Mbulelo was arrested by any police force anywhere, apart from the time that Lindelwa's sister told you of his arrest while he was with Lindelwa?  Were you ever told of any other arrest?</p>
<p class="line" id="line883"><a name="pos883"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, the name is Lindelwa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line884"><a name="pos884"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Can you please repeat your question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line885"><a name="pos885"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> How many times were you told of arrests of Mbulelo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line886"><a name="pos886"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> In March?</p>
<p class="line" id="line887"><a name="pos887"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Any time, your whole life, how many times was he arrested that you know of?</p>
<p class="line" id="line888"><a name="pos888"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> I do not know how many times Mbulelo was arrested.  What I know, he just told me that there was this narrow escape, but I don't know when he was arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line889"><a name="pos889"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> After he left in 1980, can you tell us how many times you know of that he was arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line890"><a name="pos890"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> I do not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line891"><a name="pos891"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright.  You see, you say in paragraph 8 of your statement at page 36 that the Ngono family is strongly opposed to the granting of amnesty to the applicants because</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line892"><a name="pos892"></a>"We understand that they are lying."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line893"><a name="pos893"></a>Do you read it there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line894"><a name="pos894"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line895"><a name="pos895"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What do you mean by that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line896"><a name="pos896"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Chairperson, the applicants are applying in terms of the criteria laid out in an Act and it is our responsibility as legal representatives to argue whether full disclosure has been made in terms of the requirements of the Act.  I don't know how this witness is going to be able to answer questions as to whether the requirements of the Act have been satisfied.  I think basically that is what lay persons state that they want the truth and if their loved ones are unaccounted for, then there isn't full disclosure.  Maybe Mr Visser should leave that to argument.</p>
<p class="line" id="line897"><a name="pos897"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> May I respond to that Chairperson?</p>
<p class="line" id="line898"><a name="pos898"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ja, certainly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line899"><a name="pos899"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I'm not asking her for a legal recital of - I'm asking her on what factual basis she is saying that.  How does she understand that.  There's nothing wrong with that question and frankly, I don't believe that my Learned Friend should interfere with it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line900"><a name="pos900"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I'll allow the question Mr Visser.</p>
<p class="line" id="line901"><a name="pos901"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What do you mean when you say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line902"><a name="pos902"></a>"We understand that they are lying"?</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line903"><a name="pos903"></a>Do you have an answer to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line904"><a name="pos904"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes, I do have an answer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line905"><a name="pos905"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright, will you give it to us please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line906"><a name="pos906"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> As I was listening to them giving evidence, they did not tell the truth and things that they said, they do not correspond.</p>
<p class="line" id="line907"><a name="pos907"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You see this statement was taken on the 8th of March 2000, when you hadn't heard them speaking, or giving evidence, so that can't be the answer.  Let me ask you this, how or from whom did you understand that the applicants are lying?  Who told you so, if any one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line908"><a name="pos908"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Nobody told me that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line909"><a name="pos909"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What led you to make such a statement?  On what facts would that have been?</p>
<p class="line" id="line910"><a name="pos910"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Mr Visser ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line911"><a name="pos911"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No address me first, my question first, it takes precedence over Mr Visser's question.  My question is, when you made this statement in paragraph 8 on page 36,  under what circumstances and what facts did you have to make that statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line912"><a name="pos912"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> The TRC investigator, when he came to us and told us about this case and about the investigations and he explained to us that these people told him that they arrested Mbulelo and they took him back to Lesotho, so they don't know what happened, that is why I wrote this statement like this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line913"><a name="pos913"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  You may proceed Mr Visser.</p>
<p class="line" id="line914"><a name="pos914"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you Chairperson.  The last issue I want to raise with you is this, you told this Committee about a photograph that was brought by Mr Bobelo and shown to your mother, that's what you said today, isn't that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line915"><a name="pos915"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line916"><a name="pos916"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you see the photograph?</p>
<p class="line" id="line917"><a name="pos917"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> I've already said that he showed my mother this photo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line918"><a name="pos918"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> So what you say in paragraph 14, this is your statement, is wrong, where it says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line919"><a name="pos919"></a>"Mr Bobelo even showed us a photo of Mbulelo",</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line920"><a name="pos920"></a>that would be wrong?  You'll have to say something.  Either yes, or no, or I don't know, or whatever.</p>
<p class="line" id="line921"><a name="pos921"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If you look at the tenor of that evidence and the us, which is used about twice, in reading it, it means you were present as well and you have just told us that it was shown to your mother, but if you read the us, it tells that, if I say for instance, I listened to you, we listened to you, I'm including my two Panel members if I say we, rather than if I say I listened to you.  It makes a hell of a difference and that's what you are asked upon, that the us there has the connotation that you were present when the photograph was shown.</p>
<p class="line" id="line922"><a name="pos922"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> We were there at home, but he spoke to my mother.</p>
<p class="line" id="line923"><a name="pos923"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you did not see the photograph?</p>
<p class="line" id="line924"><a name="pos924"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> No, I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line925"><a name="pos925"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you Chairperson.  Did your mother tell you about the photograph?</p>
<p class="line" id="line926"><a name="pos926"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line927"><a name="pos927"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did she say anything about that photograph to you, apart from the fact that she was shown a photograph?</p>
<p class="line" id="line928"><a name="pos928"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> She told me that Mbulelo had a scar on his face and the last time I saw him, he did not have a scar.</p>
<p class="line" id="line929"><a name="pos929"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I see.  Now that's what I want to ask you about because if I'm correct, and I stand to be corrected, but I recall that Ms Mbece, or someone, I'm sure it was Ms Mbece, also referred to the scar, may I just check this Chairperson?  Yes, at page 50, she says ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line930"><a name="pos930"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Sorry can I just correct?  It's not Ms Mbete, it's the girlfriend to Bulelo.  Ms Mabece, Mr Mbete is the investigator for the TRC, it's Lindelwa Mabece.</p>
<p class="line" id="line931"><a name="pos931"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I'm referring to a person with the name of Lindelwa Mabece.</p>
<p class="line" id="line932"><a name="pos932"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Yes, you said Mbete.  Ja.</p>
<p class="line" id="line933"><a name="pos933"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That's part of my strategy, not to listen to myself, because I can't stand my own voice.  So I do say some things that I think I say something else.  I do apologise Chairperson for being at cross-purposes on such a silly issue.  Mabece.  She says at page 50, the second line</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line934"><a name="pos934"></a>"The abduction was not enough.  They went to the family in Port Elizabeth, brought his photo"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line935"><a name="pos935"></a>Then she says this:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line936"><a name="pos936"></a>"I was shown this photo when I visited them on their request"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line937"><a name="pos937"></a>What do you say about that?  Did that happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line938"><a name="pos938"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Lindelwa visited us at home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line939"><a name="pos939"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No, that's not the question, did you show her the photograph?</p>
<p class="line" id="line940"><a name="pos940"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line941"><a name="pos941"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> So she's lying when she says that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line942"><a name="pos942"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> It is my mother who was shown this photo, maybe this happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line943"><a name="pos943"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, no, the import of what has been read to you, it would appear the photo was left behind, hence Lindelwa says she saw the photo, do you get the drift?  What you are asked about is that in this statement Lindelwa says she came to your home, she was shown this photo with Mbulelo having a scar on his face.</p>
<p class="line" id="line944"><a name="pos944"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> I am sure this is a mistake.  Maybe she was told about this photo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line945"><a name="pos945"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, what is here, it's unlike your statement, this is hand-written.  Yours has been written by longhand and thereafter typed, but this one, unless Mr Mapoma tells me otherwise, it would appear it's the same person who wrote it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line946"><a name="pos946"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Yes, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line947"><a name="pos947"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mapoma has confirmed that this is the handwriting of Lindelwa Mabece.</p>
<p class="line" id="line948"><a name="pos948"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Maybe it's Lindelwa who can be able to answer to that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line949"><a name="pos949"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was the photograph left at home by Bobelo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line950"><a name="pos950"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> I did not see it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line951"><a name="pos951"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  You may proceed, Mr Visser.</p>
<p class="line" id="line952"><a name="pos952"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you Chairperson.  But as far as you're concerned, she's clearly wrong when she says that?  As far as your knowledge goes, because you don't know anything about this photograph except that it was shown to your mother.</p>
<p class="line" id="line953"><a name="pos953"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes, it was shown to my mother.</p>
<p class="line" id="line954"><a name="pos954"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And it would be strange if the photograph was left there, that your mother didn't show you the photograph of your brother, wouldn't it be strange?</p>
<p class="line" id="line955"><a name="pos955"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes, that would be strange.</p>
<p class="line" id="line956"><a name="pos956"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you.  Now I'll tell you what is even stranger.  She goes on to say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line957"><a name="pos957"></a>"I pointed out to the family that he had no scar on his forehead when I last saw him."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line958"><a name="pos958"></a>Now as far as we know, the last time she saw him, according to this statement, was on the day that the Lesotho police took him away when there were four people present and she never saw him again after that, whenever that was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line959"><a name="pos959"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, what's strange about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line960"><a name="pos960"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I'm coming to the strange part.  I'm just putting it to you that she says that when she saw him the last time, was when he was taken away by the Lesotho police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line961"><a name="pos961"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line962"><a name="pos962"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You see, the strange thing is this, if the applicants are lying, one would have the situation that on the alternative, if Mbulelo is taken away and given to these applicants by the Lesotho police, they inflicted an injury on Mbulelo's forehead and they took a photograph of it and they circulated it to another police station.  now I know this is very technical and it's really argument, but I'm putting it to you that if there was a photograph of Mr Mbulelo Ngono with a scar on his face which he sustained while in custody of the police, it refers to a different arrest than to the one to which these applicants are testifying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line963"><a name="pos963"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Have you heard what was put to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line964"><a name="pos964"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> It might be unfair to expect this witness, Chairperson, it was really just a point made more for the sake of argument than anything else, I wouldn't expect her to make any comment about this, unless she wishes to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line965"><a name="pos965"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think I must still give her the opportunity to respond if she has any.  Do you have any response to what was put to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line966"><a name="pos966"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> I am not interested in all of this, but what I'm saying is that after Mbulelo was arrested in March, we never saw him again and he was taken by the police.  We never saw him again.  The fact that he had scars on his face or anything else, we only want to know what happened to him after he was taken by the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line967"><a name="pos967"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And we've got no argument at all with you about any of that.  Now when you talk about a scar, would that refer to an old wound, or what do you mean when you refer to a scar?</p>
<p class="line" id="line968"><a name="pos968"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> I have already said that I did not see the photograph.</p>
<p class="line" id="line969"><a name="pos969"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That may be so, but you referred to a scar.  Now how did you understand, what did you understand that to be?  Was it a mark of an old wound, or what did you understand that to mean?</p>
<p class="line" id="line970"><a name="pos970"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> The last time I saw him, he did not have a wound or a scar.</p>
<p class="line" id="line971"><a name="pos971"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Page 37, lastly, Chairperson, of the bundle, I want to put to you the last portion of this statement seems to suggest that a written statement was taken from you and that what we have before us here, is a typewritten record or copy of that hand-written statement and that it was signed by you on the date specified here, what do you say to that?  You referred to notes which he was taking, I'm suggesting to you that he took a written statement from you, Mr Mbete.</p>
<p class="line" id="line972"><a name="pos972"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line973"><a name="pos973"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> So I'm asking you again, did you sign that written statement, sign it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line974"><a name="pos974"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line975"><a name="pos975"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I heard you earlier to say that you didn't sign it, but alright, you signed it.  And that statement will be in the possession of the TRC, wouldn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line976"><a name="pos976"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line977"><a name="pos977"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> As far as you're concerned.  Thank you Chairperson, no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line978"><a name="pos978"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR VISSER</p>
<p class="line" id="line979"><a name="pos979"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Visser.  Mr Mapoma, any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line980"><a name="pos980"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> I have no questions, Chairperson, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line981"><a name="pos981"></a>NO QUESTIONS BY MR MAPOMA</p>
<p class="line" id="line982"><a name="pos982"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Malindi, any re-examination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line983"><a name="pos983"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> As the Committee pleases.</p>
<p class="line" id="line984"><a name="pos984"></a><span class="speaker">RE-EXAMINATION BY MR MALINDI:</span> Ms Ngono, if Bulelo had been arrested in December 1987 and was returned to Lesotho, where would he have stayed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line985"><a name="pos985"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> I think that if he had collaborated with them, maybe he was not going to go back to the ANC, but I'm sure he would have come to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line986"><a name="pos986"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Where did you know him to stay during the time that you used to see him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line987"><a name="pos987"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> In Roma.</p>
<p class="line" id="line988"><a name="pos988"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Is that the place that you used to visit frequently to see him and his other comrades?</p>
<p class="line" id="line989"><a name="pos989"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line990"><a name="pos990"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> If after December 1987, he had gone back to that place, would you have seen him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line991"><a name="pos991"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes, I would have seen him because I used to go there.  I used to go to Roma.</p>
<p class="line" id="line992"><a name="pos992"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> And is it your evidence that if he was in Lesotho or around Roma in December 1987, you would have seen him or his comrades would have told you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line993"><a name="pos993"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> His comrades would have told me because they came to me as they used to guide me on what to do, so they came to me and said that: "Thobeka, if Bulelo would have collaborated with them, the police would have raided our houses, so it's either they have killed him there and then."</p>
<p class="line" id="line994"><a name="pos994"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What period are you talking about, if he had collaborated, is this after receiving, or is this after you were visited by the TRC investigator, or was this whilst you were in Lesotho, what the comrades were saying about this collaboration with the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line995"><a name="pos995"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> It was when I was in Lesotho.  They came to me and said that there were no raids in their houses, which means that Bulelo did not co-operate with them.  If he did, the police would have raided their houses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line996"><a name="pos996"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, I don't follow, because the only time we know about Bulelo collaborating with the police is when these applicants made an application for amnesty.  How did you come about collaboration there?  I want just to follow that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line997"><a name="pos997"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> I heard this in Xhosa, it means more co-operation than collaboration.  Perhaps the interpret can assist, because the way she puts it in Xhosa, is that if Bulelo had co-operated with them at the time they arrested him, then they would have been raided, whatever.  Perhaps the witness can once again explain it.  That was how I understood it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line998"><a name="pos998"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No at some stage I was listening to Xhosa and it was not talk of assistance to the other, rather say to my Panel, and then I had to switch over to English so that if there is not something proper I should hear it English, so I missed out altogether on what was said in Xhosa, but could she repeat herself?  Because what I - whilst repeating yourself, I say what I do not understand is this, if there was co-operation or collaboration with the applicants, the police, that could have only been known after they had made their applications.  This is my understanding, don't say I'm putting it to you, but I just want to understand you properly.  And if you speak of co-operation with police whilst you were at Lesotho, I want to know the circumstances that gave rise to a discussion of that nature.  Do you follow me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line999"><a name="pos999"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes.  I'm talking about the cadres.  They said to me that if it happened that Bulelo was arrested and he co-operated with the police, their houses would have been raided, so because that did not happen, it means that if we did not find Bulelo, he was killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1000"><a name="pos1000"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  I just wanted that clarification.  I'm sorry Mr Malindi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1001"><a name="pos1001"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, can I just clarify one thing, because I'm a bit puzzled.  This conversation with the cadres, when did that happen?  This conversation you're talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1002"><a name="pos1002"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> After he was arrested in March, after Bulelo was arrested in March.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1003"><a name="pos1003"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, Mr Malindi.  Please continue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1004"><a name="pos1004"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Thank you Chairperson.  Mr Ngono, after Bulelo was arrested in March 1988, there obviously was concern about his whereabouts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1005"><a name="pos1005"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1006"><a name="pos1006"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> One of the concerns may have been that he was killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1007"><a name="pos1007"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> We did not think that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1008"><a name="pos1008"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> One of the concerns may have been that if he is arrested, the police will squeeze information out of him and they may come back to Lesotho to arrest some of his comrades.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1009"><a name="pos1009"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes, what we thought was that if they wanted information or if they got information from him, they would go back to Lesotho and arrest others.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1010"><a name="pos1010"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> After some time had passed and there were no raids, was there relief amongst yourself and other comrades that it means he has not collaborated with the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1011"><a name="pos1011"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1012"><a name="pos1012"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Was it in that context that the question of possibly collaborating or non-collaborating arose in Lesotho?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1013"><a name="pos1013"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes, it was in that context, because they counted the time since he was arrested and there were no raids, so they concluded that he did not co-operate with the police and they would not just keep him, perhaps they have killed him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1014"><a name="pos1014"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Thank you Chairperson, no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1015"><a name="pos1015"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MALINDI</p>
<p class="line" id="line1016"><a name="pos1016"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Malindi.  Any questions from the Panel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1017"><a name="pos1017"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Just one from me, Chairperson.  After September and before February, you said that you would visit the house where he had lived from time to time.  What was the purpose of those visits?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1018"><a name="pos1018"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Sometimes I would help them out and do their washing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1019"><a name="pos1019"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So you didn't go there specifically to ask where your brother was, or if they knew anything about your brother?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1020"><a name="pos1020"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> I saw that he was not there because I visited there several times and I did not ask them where my brother was, I did not ask the cadres.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1021"><a name="pos1021"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Now if he had returned in the late part of December, or January, up until the time that you did actually see him, where do you think he would have gone?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1022"><a name="pos1022"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> He would have gone to Roma.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1023"><a name="pos1023"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> ;   Do you think he would have visited Lindelwa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1024"><a name="pos1024"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1025"><a name="pos1025"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Did you ever ask her whether she had seen him during that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1026"><a name="pos1026"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes, and she told me that she does not see him, she doesn't even know where he is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1027"><a name="pos1027"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> ;   Now when did you return to South Africa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1028"><a name="pos1028"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> December 1988.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1029"><a name="pos1029"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And you returned to Port Elizabeth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1030"><a name="pos1030"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1031"><a name="pos1031"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And in that time you've only had this one visit that you know of of this person who works at Louis le Grange, or some other policeman who might have visited there with any information regarding your brother?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1032"><a name="pos1032"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes, my mother was also in detention at that time, so when my mother was in detention, she said that they asked her whether to bring Bulelo so that he can be a State witness in their case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1033"><a name="pos1033"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> When was your mother detained?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1034"><a name="pos1034"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> March.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1035"><a name="pos1035"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Which year?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1036"><a name="pos1036"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> 1988.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1037"><a name="pos1037"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And do you know why she was detained?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1038"><a name="pos1038"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> She was working with the cadres.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1039"><a name="pos1039"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And in March 1988, your mother was told by a certain policeman that they were going to bring Bulelo to be a State witness against her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1040"><a name="pos1040"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> They said in this case, in this particular case - they said that they can bring Bulelo to be a State witness in that case, in my mother's case and then my mother said that that depended on him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1041"><a name="pos1041"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Did your mother ever have a case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1042"><a name="pos1042"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes, the one she was detained for, for co-operating or working together with the cadres.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1043"><a name="pos1043"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was she prosecuted when she was detained for working with the cadres, in other words, appeared in court, charges put to her, that kind of thing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1044"><a name="pos1044"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes, she appeared in court.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1045"><a name="pos1045"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> ;   Did the case proceed against her so that witnesses were called and so on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1046"><a name="pos1046"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> There were no witnesses because all of them were arrested with the cadres that she was working with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1047"><a name="pos1047"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And Bulelo never testified in that case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1048"><a name="pos1048"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1049"><a name="pos1049"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Finish off the sentence.  No, they did not bring him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1050"><a name="pos1050"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Thanks Chairperson, I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1051"><a name="pos1051"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson, just one question.  Were you told why you were excluded from the discussions when Mr Bulelo visited your mother?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1052"><a name="pos1052"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> No, he did not tell us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1053"><a name="pos1053"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Also do you know why the photo was not shown to you in person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1054"><a name="pos1054"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> I do not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1055"><a name="pos1055"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Thank you.  No further questions, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1056"><a name="pos1056"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Lax, you said you had something else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1057"><a name="pos1057"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Thanks Chair, sorry I just forgot the one aspect and that was, this Mr Bulelo, is he still around?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1058"><a name="pos1058"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes, he is still around, he's still alive.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1059"><a name="pos1059"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And is he still a policeman, or does he still work there?  I don't know if he's a policeman or not, but does he still work at Louis le Grange police station?  is he a policeman?  Let me ask you that question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1060"><a name="pos1060"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> He is on retirement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1061"><a name="pos1061"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Thank you.  But you know where to find him if you have to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1062"><a name="pos1062"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes, I know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1063"><a name="pos1063"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1064"><a name="pos1064"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just lastly.  When did your mother die?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1065"><a name="pos1065"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> January 2000.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1066"><a name="pos1066"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Anything that arises from the questions from the bench, Mr Malindi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1067"><a name="pos1067"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Just two, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1068"><a name="pos1068"></a><span class="speaker">FURTHER RE-EXAMINATION BY MR MALINDI:</span> Ms Ngono, while you were at school in Lesotho, did you develop friendships with other cadres who were known to your brother?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1069"><a name="pos1069"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1070"><a name="pos1070"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Is that part of the reason why you visited frequently to where they stayed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1071"><a name="pos1071"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1072"><a name="pos1072"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> In 1990 when Mr Bulelo came to your house and spoke to your mother, how old were you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1073"><a name="pos1073"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> I cannot remember, maybe I was 27 years old.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1074"><a name="pos1074"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> May your age have been a reason why Mr Bulelo only wanted to speak to your mother?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1075"><a name="pos1075"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Chairperson really, that's ... to put to a witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1076"><a name="pos1076"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Rephrase your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1077"><a name="pos1077"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Chairperson I'll leave it at that, nothing will really turn on it at the end of the day.  Thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1078"><a name="pos1078"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1079"><a name="pos1079"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> I say Chairperson, nothing much will turn on it at the end of the day, I'm prepared to drop it, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1080"><a name="pos1080"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> This statement says that you're 34 years old, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1081"><a name="pos1081"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1082"><a name="pos1082"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So obviously in 1990, you would have been 24 years old.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1083"><a name="pos1083"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He is good in Arithmetic, he revised it last night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1084"><a name="pos1084"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> You remember he went terribly wrong yesterday.  He said in a week, ...(indistinct) out of five days, I said:  "Oh, how many days does a week have?"  You may proceed, or are you finished, Mr Malindi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1085"><a name="pos1085"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> No further questions Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1086"><a name="pos1086"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MALINDI</p>
<p class="line" id="line1087"><a name="pos1087"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Visser anything arising?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1088"><a name="pos1088"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, Chairperson, there are a few issues that now arise, with your permission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1089"><a name="pos1089"></a><span class="speaker">FURTHER CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR VISSER:</span> Let me perhaps start this way, you say that you made friends with cadres who were friends of your brother, Bulelo, while you were in Lesotho in 1987, that is correct, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1090"><a name="pos1090"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1091"><a name="pos1091"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you have a relationship with any of them that was more than just a friendship?  And I want to tell you that I'm not prying into your private affairs, what I want to know is whether you sometimes went to the houses where your brother lived, not to visit him, but to visit someone else, did that happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1092"><a name="pos1092"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> No, it was not beyond friendship.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1093"><a name="pos1093"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> But did you sometimes go and visit the cadres without specifically intending to go and visit your brother?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1094"><a name="pos1094"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> The reason why I went there was because of my brother.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1095"><a name="pos1095"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well you see, you also told us that you went there to go and help them out, to do their washing, isn't that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1096"><a name="pos1096"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes, that is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1097"><a name="pos1097"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> So that's a reason why you went there, which wasn't specifically to visit your brother, isn't that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1098"><a name="pos1098"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Even when I did not have money, I would go there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1099"><a name="pos1099"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well alright, whatever that means.  But is it true that you told this Committee earlier today that your brother stayed in many places when he was in Lesotho?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1100"><a name="pos1100"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1101"><a name="pos1101"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Does that not mean that he didn't have a fixed home where he stayed most of the time, he was moving around?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1102"><a name="pos1102"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> He did not have a fixed place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1103"><a name="pos1103"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Was he moving around a lot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1104"><a name="pos1104"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes, he would go to the university and he'd move around.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1105"><a name="pos1105"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And would it be fair to say when you went to visit him you never knew whether you would find him where you went, or whether you wouldn't find him there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1106"><a name="pos1106"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes, but I knew that I would see him because he would visit Lindelwa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1107"><a name="pos1107"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> So did you always go to Lindelwa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1108"><a name="pos1108"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes, I would go to Lindelwa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1109"><a name="pos1109"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Was that the only place where you visited your brother?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1110"><a name="pos1110"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Even the place that he was staying, I would visit there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1111"><a name="pos1111"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> So you went to visit your brother at two places, is that your evidence, in Lesotho?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1112"><a name="pos1112"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1113"><a name="pos1113"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> How did the whole issue of either collaboration or working with the police, come to be discussed with you by the cadres in Lesotho in 1988?  How did it come about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1114"><a name="pos1114"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> It was when we were looking for him, when he was arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1115"><a name="pos1115"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did somebody then say:  "Perhaps he's turned, perhaps he's become an informer of the South African police"?  Is that what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1116"><a name="pos1116"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> They knew that people were tortured and when you were being tortured you divulged certain information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1117"><a name="pos1117"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I see.  Alright.  Now you see you said when Commissioner Lax asked you questions, I made a note of one of your answers and that is the reason why I'm asking you all these questions.  You said between September and February, when you say your brother wasn't there, when you visited the house where he lived, you were asked what was the purpose of those visits, do you remember that?  Do you remember you were asked that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1118"><a name="pos1118"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> I said that sometimes when I did not have money I would go there, even when Bulelo was not there, they would give me some money and they would visit me even when Bulelo was not there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1119"><a name="pos1119"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Ms Ngono, please listen to my question.  Do you remember that Mr Lax asked you, between September and February when you visited the house where he lived, your brother lived, what the purpose was of those visits, do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1120"><a name="pos1120"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Mpilo was there in that house, so I would go and visit him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1121"><a name="pos1121"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> You would go and visit him, not your brother?  You weren't looking for your brother, you went to look for Mpilo, is that what you're saying?  The purpose was to go and visit Mpilo, is that what you're saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1122"><a name="pos1122"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1123"><a name="pos1123"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And you also said that you did not ask the cadres where your brother was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1124"><a name="pos1124"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> I did not ask them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1125"><a name="pos1125"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Lastly, we never heard before about this piece of evidence that Bulelo was going to be used against your mother as a State witness.  Is that something you told your legal representatives about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1126"><a name="pos1126"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> This came up because there are a lot of questions now that I've been asked.  I don't remember telling my legal representative.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1127"><a name="pos1127"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What was - did you hear about this threat to use Bulelo against your mother, at the time?  Did you know about that at the time, when this threat was issued to your mother, when your mother was in detention, or was it something that you heard about later?  I just want to know when you heard about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1128"><a name="pos1128"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> When we went to visit my mother, she told me about this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1129"><a name="pos1129"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You see that's the thing, when did you go to visit your mother?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1130"><a name="pos1130"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> I went home in December and I visited her in December 88, but that was said to her before.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1131"><a name="pos1131"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you go home for the school holidays?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1132"><a name="pos1132"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1133"><a name="pos1133"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And did you also go home for the school holidays in 1987 in December?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1134"><a name="pos1134"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1135"><a name="pos1135"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well, Ms Ngono, with great respect to you then, I don't understand your evidence at all.  I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1136"><a name="pos1136"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It would be fair, Mr Visser, to say what you don't understand.  Probably it could be cleared up.  You cannot just say:  "I don't understand" and stop there, it wouldn't be fair to the witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1137"><a name="pos1137"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Perhaps I should be fair to her then.  If you had gone home in December 1987, which you just said you did, home means to Port Elizabeth, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1138"><a name="pos1138"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1139"><a name="pos1139"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What does your evidence mean about you going to the places where your brother lived in Lesotho and visiting Mpilo and helping with the washing and all that evidence that you gave, while all the time you're sitting in Port Elizabeth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1140"><a name="pos1140"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well I suppose first thing we should establish when the holidays were.  It wouldn't be fair, again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1141"><a name="pos1141"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you Chairperson.  When did the school holidays in Lesotho commence, the December holidays, when did they start?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1142"><a name="pos1142"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> I went home in December and I went back to Lesotho in December.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1143"><a name="pos1143"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> When did the school holidays commence in Lesotho?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1144"><a name="pos1144"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> I cannot remember the date.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1145"><a name="pos1145"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Was it from the beginning of December that the schools closed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1146"><a name="pos1146"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> No, it was not the beginning of December.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1147"><a name="pos1147"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well from when in December?  The middle of December, when?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1148"><a name="pos1148"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> I cannot remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1149"><a name="pos1149"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Why not?  You were at school there.  Were you attending school over Christmas, for example?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1150"><a name="pos1150"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> You said that if I do not remember something, I should say so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1151"><a name="pos1151"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Fair enough, I stand corrected.  Well, can we assume that the schools would have closed before Christmas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1152"><a name="pos1152"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes, they were closed before Christmas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1153"><a name="pos1153"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And you then went home?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1154"><a name="pos1154"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1155"><a name="pos1155"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> To Port Elizabeth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1156"><a name="pos1156"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1157"><a name="pos1157"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And the school started when in the new year, somewhere in January?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1158"><a name="pos1158"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1159"><a name="pos1159"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Is that when you came back, went back to Lesotho in 1988?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1160"><a name="pos1160"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1161"><a name="pos1161"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> So at least from before Christmas until January, you are not able to tell us whether Bulelo was in Lesotho, or whether he wasn't there, isn't that correct, not from your own knowledge?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1162"><a name="pos1162"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> I can tell you because I went back to Lesotho in December, I was sent to go to Lesotho and Bulelo was not there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1163"><a name="pos1163"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Who sent you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1164"><a name="pos1164"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> My mother.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1165"><a name="pos1165"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> To do what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1166"><a name="pos1166"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> My mother was working with the cadres that were in Lesotho.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1167"><a name="pos1167"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> To do what?  Why did your mother send you to Lesotho?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1168"><a name="pos1168"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> She gave me a letter, but I don't know what was written in that letter.  Maybe she was asking for money.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1169"><a name="pos1169"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> A letter addressed to whom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1170"><a name="pos1170"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> I have it to two girls that were in Roma.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1171"><a name="pos1171"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And that's why your mother sent you to ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1172"><a name="pos1172"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> So I spent December holidays in Lesotho, Christmas day I was there in Lesotho.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1173"><a name="pos1173"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> So actually it wasn't correct to say that you spent the Christmas, or your spent - you were in Port Elizabeth in December, you were actually in Lesotho in December.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1174"><a name="pos1174"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> She said she came home in December and went back to Lesotho again in December, that's what she said.   Now it is now quite clear when she went back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1175"><a name="pos1175"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> So you were there at Christmas, on Christmas day you were in Lesotho?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1176"><a name="pos1176"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes, I was in Lesotho on Christmas day and to follow up from what the Chairperson just stated, you can't tell us when you left Lesotho to go to Port Elizabeth, that date you can't remember, is that what you're saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1177"><a name="pos1177"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Yes, I cannot remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1178"><a name="pos1178"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> it could have been a week, it could have been two weeks, you don't remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1179"><a name="pos1179"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> Perhaps it's three weeks, but I cannot remember when the school holidays started.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1180"><a name="pos1180"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Would you bear with me a short moment Chairperson?  I know it's gone way past one o'clock already.  I have no further questions, thank you.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1198"><a name="pos1198"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> That is correct, that's my sister.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1199"><a name="pos1199"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> And you are familiar with these hearings.  Could you please tell the Committee when she left for exile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1200"><a name="pos1200"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> In 1979.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1201"><a name="pos1201"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> From 1979 when she left, was the family able to keep contact with her or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1202"><a name="pos1202"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> No, Chairperson, we were not able to be in contact with her.  We were supposed to meet in 1986 in December.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1203"><a name="pos1203"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Could you please repeat your answer, I couldn't get it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1204"><a name="pos1204"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> We contacted her for the first time in 1986, since she left in 1979 in December.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1205"><a name="pos1205"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> How did you contact her in December in 1986?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1206"><a name="pos1206"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> We contacted her telephonically.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1207"><a name="pos1207"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> ;   Who spoke to her on the phone?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1208"><a name="pos1208"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> I contacted her myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1209"><a name="pos1209"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Did you phone her yourself, or what was the position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1210"><a name="pos1210"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> She's the one who used to contact us through telephone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1211"><a name="pos1211"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> And did you know where she was contacting you from when she phoned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1212"><a name="pos1212"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> She told me that she's around Free State, but she did not mention a particular place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1213"><a name="pos1213"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Besides this telephonic contact that you had in December 1986, was there any other form of contact within the family and Betty Boom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1214"><a name="pos1214"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> Yes, she used to contact me then she would tell me a place where we'd meet and then I will go there and meet her and have a discussion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1215"><a name="pos1215"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> ;   Can you give the Committee the period during which you had these subsequent meetings with her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1216"><a name="pos1216"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> We met on ten occasions where we met, or she would contact me through the phone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1217"><a name="pos1217"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Which year was this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1218"><a name="pos1218"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> Up to 1987.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1219"><a name="pos1219"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Do you remember more or less the date on which you last met her place to place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1220"><a name="pos1220"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> I don't remember the particular date, but it was somewhere towards the end of November or towards the beginning of December 1987.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1221"><a name="pos1221"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> And was that the last contact you had with her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1222"><a name="pos1222"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1223"><a name="pos1223"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> You have heard the evidence being led here.  If Betty was arrested at one stage and released in December of 1987, from your knowledge of her, is she a person who would have contacted you or not afterwards?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1224"><a name="pos1224"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> Yes, she could have contacted me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1225"><a name="pos1225"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> And is your evidence that from about the end of November, beginning of December 1987, you never heard anything from her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1226"><a name="pos1226"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> I never had contact with her since then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1227"><a name="pos1227"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Thank you Chairperson, no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1228"><a name="pos1228"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MALINDI</p>

<p class="line" id="line1230"><a name="pos1230"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Just a few, thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1231"><a name="pos1231"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR VISSER:</span> I'm sorry, I didn't understand exactly what dates you were referring to.  Is it correct, first of all, that you made a statement which might be shown to you at page 40 of the bundle, apparently a type-written copy of a statement which you made to a Mr M M Mbete?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1232"><a name="pos1232"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1233"><a name="pos1233"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Do you recognise that as a true type-written copy of the statement which you made to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1234"><a name="pos1234"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1235"><a name="pos1235"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And has this statement been shown, or read to you, before you came to give your evidence here today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1236"><a name="pos1236"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> I saw the statement previously, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1237"><a name="pos1237"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Right.  You see, in paragraph 4 you said</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1238"><a name="pos1238"></a>"Betty Boom left the country"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1239"><a name="pos1239"></a>that is the Republic of South Africa,</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1240"><a name="pos1240"></a>"in 1979."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1241"><a name="pos1241"></a>Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1242"><a name="pos1242"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> Correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1243"><a name="pos1243"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And you say in paragraph  6 she was working hard for the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1244"><a name="pos1244"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> Correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1245"><a name="pos1245"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you also know that Betty Boom was trained in military warfare and that she had become an MK soldier?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1246"><a name="pos1246"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> I knew, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1247"><a name="pos1247"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did she tell you that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1248"><a name="pos1248"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> Yes she did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1249"><a name="pos1249"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And were you aware that what she was doing in Lesotho, was organising for raids or missions into South Africa for attacks?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1250"><a name="pos1250"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> I did not know that chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1251"><a name="pos1251"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I see. Now from 1979, did I understand you correctly that the first time that you made contact, or you made contact with each other since that was in 1985, of did I misunderstand you?  86, sorry, in December 1986.  That was the first time since 1979 that you made contact?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1252"><a name="pos1252"></a><span class="speaker">MS NGONO:</span> That is correct, Chairperson, that was for the first time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1253"><a name="pos1253"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where was she  in December 1986, Betty Boom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1254"><a name="pos1254"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> She informed me that she was in the Free State, but she did not mention a particular place where she was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1255"><a name="pos1255"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> 1986.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1256"><a name="pos1256"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1257"><a name="pos1257"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you know, or did she tell you at any stage that she was going for military training somewhere outside the country?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1258"><a name="pos1258"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> She did not tell me that Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1259"><a name="pos1259"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you know or were you told by anyone at any stage that she was at some stage in Lusaka in Zambia?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1260"><a name="pos1260"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> I don't know that, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1261"><a name="pos1261"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Now I want you please to explain and that's why I'm asking these questions to you, you say that you met or had telephonic contact with Betty Boom on ten occasions up to 1987, is that what you said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1262"><a name="pos1262"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> Yes, that's what I said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1263"><a name="pos1263"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And is that since 1979, or is that since December 1986?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1264"><a name="pos1264"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> From 1986, that is when we started to contact one another.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1265"><a name="pos1265"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And you said, if I'm not mistaken, that when she contacted you in December 1986, she was somewhere in the Free State?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1266"><a name="pos1266"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1267"><a name="pos1267"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And where were you then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1268"><a name="pos1268"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> I was at home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1269"><a name="pos1269"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Where is that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1270"><a name="pos1270"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> In Rocklands.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1271"><a name="pos1271"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Where in Rocklands?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1272"><a name="pos1272"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> 6601 Rocklands, Free State.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1273"><a name="pos1273"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Now you see, that's the point.  Your sister contacts you after seven years, being away for seven years, she says to you:  "I'm somewhere in the Free State".  Didn't you want to know why she didn't come and see you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1274"><a name="pos1274"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> The way occasions were, I met her personally.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1275"><a name="pos1275"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No, no, please Ms Seyoe - how do you pronounce your surname?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1276"><a name="pos1276"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> Seyoe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1277"><a name="pos1277"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You hadn't seen her for seven years, we've established that clearly.  Out of the blue in December 1986 she contacts you.   Were you happy to hear from her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1278"><a name="pos1278"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> Yes, I was happy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1279"><a name="pos1279"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> She tells you that she's somewhere in the Free States.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1280"><a name="pos1280"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> Yes, she did tell me that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1281"><a name="pos1281"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Don't you ask her:  "Where are your, are you in Bloemfontein, where are you?"</p>
<p class="line" id="line1282"><a name="pos1282"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> I did Chairperson, but she told me that she's somewhere in the Free State and thereafter we met personally, after that first telephonic conversation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1283"><a name="pos1283"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did she come to your house to meet with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1284"><a name="pos1284"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> No, she did not come at home.  We made an appointment to meet somewhere, we did not meet at home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1285"><a name="pos1285"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright.  Where is this somewhere where you met?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1286"><a name="pos1286"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> The question was, where did you meet?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1287"><a name="pos1287"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> At time she would be at the corner next to the tarred road, then I would go there and meet her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1288"><a name="pos1288"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I'm sorry, where?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1289"><a name="pos1289"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> The third street from where I was staying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1290"><a name="pos1290"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I see.  Alright.  So obviously for security reason I assume, she didn't come to your house and you met secretively somewhere on a road, is that your evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1291"><a name="pos1291"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1292"><a name="pos1292"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright.  Now did that occur from December 1986 onwards?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1293"><a name="pos1293"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> That is correct, Chairperson, but there were times when - we were not meeting, you know, on a daily basis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1294"><a name="pos1294"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well, you're a person that can remember that you met her exactly ten times.  Will you please tell us, did you meet her in January 1987?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1295"><a name="pos1295"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> I'm not able to recall, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1296"><a name="pos1296"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> February 1987?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1297"><a name="pos1297"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> I don't recall when did we meet after she phoned in 1986 December.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1298"><a name="pos1298"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you meet her at any stage on the street before September 1987?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1299"><a name="pos1299"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> I think we met before September.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1300"><a name="pos1300"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> How sure are you of that?  Remember you said you met her ten time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1301"><a name="pos1301"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> She didn't say she met her ten times.  She said she had contact with her, including the meetings, ten times.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1302"><a name="pos1302"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That - I stand corrected, quite correct.  you had ten contacts with her.  Let me ask you this then - you're absolutely correct, Commissioner Lax, I do apologise.  These ten contacts that you had, both on the telephone and meeting her, how many times did you actually meet her, of those ten contacts?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1303"><a name="pos1303"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> I'm not able to tell how many times did we contact on the phone, so our personal contact is plus or minus ten times, but I don't remember how many times did we contact each other telephonically.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1304"><a name="pos1304"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Are you now saying that you had personal meetings with her on ten occasions since December 1986?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1305"><a name="pos1305"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> No, she said telephonic.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1306"><a name="pos1306"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The ... and clarify that the interpreter said there were ten personal contacts and telephonically.  Did I hear you ....</p>
<p class="line" id="line1307"><a name="pos1307"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> She says they met personally more than ten times, but she's not able to recall how many times did she have a telephonic contact with her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1308"><a name="pos1308"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1309"><a name="pos1309"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> She doesn't remember how many times they had telephonic contact, but personally, they met more than ten times.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1310"><a name="pos1310"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well that's almost what I heard, but I didn't hear the more than ten times.  I only heard ten times, there were ten personal contacts, that's what I heard, I don't know whether the translation was correct or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1311"><a name="pos1311"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That's what I heard through the translation Mr Visser.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1312"><a name="pos1312"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well perhaps to be fair to you, can I just ask you again, did you actually meet personally with your sister Betty Boom on ten occasions since December 1986?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1313"><a name="pos1313"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> We met personally ten times, but I'm not able to recall how many times did we contact each other telephonically.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1314"><a name="pos1314"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright.  Is what you're really saying perhaps this, I'm trying to be as fair as I possibly can, that when you talk about personal contact, you talk about meeting her and telephone calls?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1315"><a name="pos1315"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> To meet, we met more than ten times, but through the phone, I'm not able to remember how many times.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1316"><a name="pos1316"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright, this more than ten meetings that you had with her since December 1986, did any of those meetings take place in South Africa before September 1987?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1317"><a name="pos1317"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> I don't understand the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1318"><a name="pos1318"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you meet with your sister Betty Boom personally since December 1986, before September of 1987?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1319"><a name="pos1319"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> Yes, we met.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1320"><a name="pos1320"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> So if somebody was to say that she left Lusaka only in September - I'm sorry, I stand corrected.  Can I rephrase my question?  Did you meet Betty Boom since December 1986, before August 1987, I'm sorry, I had the date wrong, before August 1987?  So between December 86 and August 1987, did you meet her personally here in South Africa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1321"><a name="pos1321"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> Yes, we met.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1322"><a name="pos1322"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Are you quite sure of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1323"><a name="pos1323"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> Yes I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1324"><a name="pos1324"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> So if somebody was to say that Betty Boom left Lusaka in August or September of 1987, that can't possibly be correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1325"><a name="pos1325"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1326"><a name="pos1326"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No, how can you say you don't know, because you say that you met her here in South Africa before then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1327"><a name="pos1327"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> I met with her, but not everyday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1328"><a name="pos1328"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright.  Do you know a person - was your maiden name Boom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1329"><a name="pos1329"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> Yes, that is correct, that's my maiden surname.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1330"><a name="pos1330"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Do you know a person by the name of Sam Booms?  Sam?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1331"><a name="pos1331"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1332"><a name="pos1332"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> He was also apparently known as Mazebuku, Isaac Melusi Mazebuku, that's not a person that is related to you, is it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1333"><a name="pos1333"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> I don't remember that person, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1334"><a name="pos1334"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Chairperson, it's not a secret, the reason why I'm asking that appears in the August 1996 statement of the ANC to the TRC at page 98 where that name appears as a person who died in exile as number 13 under Angola.  We were just wondering whether there was some connection.  And you say the last contact with Betty Boom was either the end of November or the beginning of December 1987?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1335"><a name="pos1335"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1336"><a name="pos1336"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> On that occasion did she phone you, or did you phone her, or did you meet personally?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1337"><a name="pos1337"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> She phoned me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1338"><a name="pos1338"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Now will you please tell the Committee, were you aware that Betty Boom was in Lesotho around November/ December 1987?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1339"><a name="pos1339"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> I did not know where she was, when she telephoned me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1340"><a name="pos1340"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And you don't know whose house it was, or where the telephone was that you used to phone to talk to Betty Boom, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1341"><a name="pos1341"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I suppose we should establish that who phoned who first.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1342"><a name="pos1342"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Ja, evidence-in-chief was that they phoned each other, Chairperson, but I can perhaps revisit that issue.  Did you at times phone your sister Betty Boom wherever she was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1343"><a name="pos1343"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> No, Chairperson, I did not, she was the one who was phoning me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1344"><a name="pos1344"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I see.  Alright, well then I heard it incorrectly, I'm sorry.  You see, you say in paragraph 7 of your statement</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1345"><a name="pos1345"></a>"She used to send messages to us at home with other comrades who used to go to Lesotho."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1346"><a name="pos1346"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1347"><a name="pos1347"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> But why do you mention Lesotho, if you didn't know that she was in Lesotho?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1348"><a name="pos1348"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> She never said she didn't know she was in Lesotho, what she said was she didn't know where she was phoning from. That was your question and that was her answer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1349"><a name="pos1349"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Let me ask the same question I asked before.  Did you know that Betty Boom was in Lesotho in November or December 1987?  I asked you this before.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1350"><a name="pos1350"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> I did not know where she was because at times she would just say she's in the Free State.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1351"><a name="pos1351"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That's right.  So why do you mention in paragraph 7, why do you mention Lesotho?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1352"><a name="pos1352"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> I said so because here I was not saying that at that time in November/December 1987 I knew that she was in Lesotho, I was just saying that she was in Lesotho at any particular time, which I did not know when.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1353"><a name="pos1353"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You know, I don't understand why you're not just being frank and I'll tell you why I make this allegation.  In paragraph 5 you explicitly said that you last saw her in 1987 when she was in Lesotho.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1354"><a name="pos1354"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1355"><a name="pos1355"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> So why do you deny that you knew that she was in Lesotho?  I don't understand it.  But let's go on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1356"><a name="pos1356"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Let her explain.  If you ask her a question, let her explain.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1357"><a name="pos1357"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Can you explain?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1358"><a name="pos1358"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> In times she would be in Lesotho, yes, but other times she would be in the Free State, but not knowing where, so I would not know when she would be in Lesotho or when she would be in the Free State.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1359"><a name="pos1359"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> When you say in paragraph 7 that when she sent messages to you, she never seemed to be disillusioned about the ANC, do you see that in paragraph 7?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1360"><a name="pos1360"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> Yes, that is correct, Chairperson, she seems not to be disillusioned with the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1361"><a name="pos1361"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Why did you make that statement in your document?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1362"><a name="pos1362"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> Because I knew that she had more problems with the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1363"><a name="pos1363"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That's not the answer to my question.  The question is what prompted you to make that statement in your written statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1364"><a name="pos1364"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> I wrote this statement in this way because the person who was taking the statement asked me questions to that regard as to whether - what was her well-being.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1365"><a name="pos1365"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  The person who took the statement from you, didn't he tell you what Mr Jantjie said in his amnesty application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1366"><a name="pos1366"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> No, Chairperson, she did not tell me, because I did not even have Jantjie's Statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1367"><a name="pos1367"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> In any event, you see, I also don't understand your evidence compared to your statement, because in your evidence you talk about ten personal contacts with her and in your statement you never refer to personal contacts, you only refer to messages.  Why is that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1368"><a name="pos1368"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> Perhaps I forgot when I was writing this statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1369"><a name="pos1369"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1370"><a name="pos1370"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Chairperson if regard is held to paragraph 5, then the statement is not that accurate that has been put to the witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1371"><a name="pos1371"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What is the problem Chairperson?  Paragraph 5 says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1372"><a name="pos1372"></a>"I last saw her in 1987 when she was in Lesotho".</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1373"><a name="pos1373"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> It means that there was contact with her besides the messages that are referred to in paragraph 7.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1374"><a name="pos1374"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Oh, I see, alright, fair enough.  Let me put it this way then.  You did not refer in your statement to the fact that you saw Betty Boom often, personally, do you agree with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1375"><a name="pos1375"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What would ten occasions mean personally?  We're talking about December 1986, what would ten occasions because I think the evidence that she saw the sister more than ten times, that's her evidence, from December 1986 when they made personal contact.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1376"><a name="pos1376"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I'm just asking the witness - perhaps I could put it this way, is there any particular reason why you didn't say that in your statement, you didn't refer to these personal contacts in your statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1377"><a name="pos1377"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> There's not reason, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1378"><a name="pos1378"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Who's Ms Semang, that you refer to in paragraph 9?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1379"><a name="pos1379"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> He's one of the ANC members from Johannesburg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1380"><a name="pos1380"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> ;   Sorry, is it a he or a she because it says Ms here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1381"><a name="pos1381"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> She's one of ANC members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1382"><a name="pos1382"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And she told you that Betty Boom was dead, she told you this in 1997.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1383"><a name="pos1383"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> May you please repeat the question ...(indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1384"><a name="pos1384"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright.  In paragraph 9 of your statement, you alleged that the family first learned about Betty's disappearance in about 1997 when told by Ms Semang that Betty was dead.  Is that statement correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1385"><a name="pos1385"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1386"><a name="pos1386"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Were you present when the family was told this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1387"><a name="pos1387"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> I was present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1388"><a name="pos1388"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And who is Ms Semang?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1389"><a name="pos1389"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> I said she's one of the ANC members from Johannesburg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1390"><a name="pos1390"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you ask her what the circumstances of Betty Boom's death were, as far as the ANC knew?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1391"><a name="pos1391"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> We asked her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1392"><a name="pos1392"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What did she tell you?  How did she know that Betty Boom was dead?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1393"><a name="pos1393"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> She informed us that it was learned that Betty Boom was killed in Ladybrand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1394"><a name="pos1394"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did she tell you by whom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1395"><a name="pos1395"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> She did not say, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1396"><a name="pos1396"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you ask her what had happened to Betty Boom's remains?  Where is she?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1397"><a name="pos1397"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> We were informed that Betty Boom's remains were buried somewhere in Ladybrand in one of the farms, but she did not know the particular farm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1398"><a name="pos1398"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Do you oppose the applications of the applicants for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1399"><a name="pos1399"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> Yes, I am against the application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1400"><a name="pos1400"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Why is that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1401"><a name="pos1401"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> They applied for amnesty but the statements they submitted did not state what happened to Betty Boom and others, they just stated that they abducted them from Lesotho and returned them to Lesotho, but they did not tell us the end.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1402"><a name="pos1402"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What is the end?  What end is that?  I don't follow you.  You say they didn't tell you what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1403"><a name="pos1403"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> They stated that they left them at the taxi rank.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1404"><a name="pos1404"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, so they did tell you what happened to them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1405"><a name="pos1405"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> They did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1406"><a name="pos1406"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I see.  So you don't believe them, do you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1407"><a name="pos1407"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> I don't believe them because I don't see the reason why they should take Betty from her house and then when they return her to Lesotho, why they don't take her direct to where they took her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1408"><a name="pos1408"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Is that the reason why you don't believe their evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1409"><a name="pos1409"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEYOE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1410"><a name="pos1410"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No further questions, thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1411"><a name="pos1411"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR VISSER</p>
<p class="line" id="line1412"><a name="pos1412"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Visser.  Mr Mapoma, any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1413"><a name="pos1413"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> I have none, Chairperson, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1414"><a name="pos1414"></a>NO QUESTIONS BY MR MAPOMA</p>

<p class="line" id="line1418"><a name="pos1418"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> I have got no question Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1419"><a name="pos1419"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Any re-examination?  The other way round, I wanted when there is any everything must be covered because of time.  I do apologise, that's not the procedure, but I had that in mind, even though I did not vocalise it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1420"><a name="pos1420"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> I understand Chairperson, there's no re-examination.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1421"><a name="pos1421"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ms Seyoe, we thank you very much.  That is the end of your evidence.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1424"><a name="pos1424"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Thank you Chairperson.  Chairperson, I beg leave to call Mrs Sejanamane.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1425"><a name="pos1425"></a><span class="speaker">MARIA DIJENG SEJANAMANE:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1426"><a name="pos1426"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Malindi, you may proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1427"><a name="pos1427"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1428"><a name="pos1428"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR MALINDI:</span> Mrs Sejanamane, how are you related to Tax Sejanamane?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1429"><a name="pos1429"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> Tax Sejanamane is my son.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1430"><a name="pos1430"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Did your son at any stage leave home to go into exile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1431"><a name="pos1431"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> Yes, that is when he went to Lesotho.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1432"><a name="pos1432"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Are you able to tell the Committee when it was that he went to Lesotho?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1433"><a name="pos1433"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> The last time I saw Godfrey Thebogo Sejanamane in 1980, that is when he was still harassed by the police.  They used to come and detain him.  They used to fetch him from school.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1434"><a name="pos1434"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Then after he had gone into exile, did you know where he was staying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1435"><a name="pos1435"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> Yes, I did know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1436"><a name="pos1436"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Where was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1437"><a name="pos1437"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> He was at Upper Thamai in Lesotho at his wife's sister.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1438"><a name="pos1438"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Was he staying with his wife's sister?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1439"><a name="pos1439"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> He had a room there. They were not staying together in the same house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1440"><a name="pos1440"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> You mentioned his wife, where was his wife?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1441"><a name="pos1441"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> She was also there at Upper Thamai.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1442"><a name="pos1442"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> At a different place to where Tax was staying, or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1443"><a name="pos1443"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> Yes, that is where they got married.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1444"><a name="pos1444"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> And do you know which year Tax was staying with his wife and the wife's sister's place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1445"><a name="pos1445"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Chairperson, with respect, that's not the evidence of this witness.  The evidence of this witness has been specific now that she stayed at a place different from where Mr - unless I've missed out on something.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1446"><a name="pos1446"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That is correct.  First they stayed at different places, unless I misheard, but I'll give you an opportunity Mr Malindi, I think I heard what Mr Visser heard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1447"><a name="pos1447"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Thank you Chairperson.  I'm a bit confused then and maybe I should cover the ground again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1448"><a name="pos1448"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You are welcome to do that.  Thank you Chairperson.  Give us a moment, the interpreter is coming to get something right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1449"><a name="pos1449"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Ms Sejanamane, could I please ask you to clarify something?  I may have been confused.  You testified that Tax was staying at his wife's sister's place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1450"><a name="pos1450"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1451"><a name="pos1451"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Did he stay with his sister-in-law in the same house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1452"><a name="pos1452"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> No, they had their own room.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1453"><a name="pos1453"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> When you say they had their own room, who are you referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1454"><a name="pos1454"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> I mean Tax and his wife.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1455"><a name="pos1455"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> And was their own room on the same premises as his sister-in-law's house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1456"><a name="pos1456"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> That is correct, Chairperson, they were in the same yard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1457"><a name="pos1457"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Chairperson, if I've clarified, may I proceed again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1458"><a name="pos1458"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Then you may proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1459"><a name="pos1459"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Thank you Chairperson.  Which year was it when Tax and his wife were staying in a room on the same premises where his sister-in-law's house was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1460"><a name="pos1460"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> If I recall, in 1982 they were still staying there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1461"><a name="pos1461"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> While Tax was in exile, was the family able to communicate with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1462"><a name="pos1462"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> Yes, we had contact.  We used to go and see him there because we heard from the people that he was in Maseru, so I wanted to go and see him there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1463"><a name="pos1463"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> At one stage the ANC and other organisations were unbanned.  Did you get to meet your son thereafter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1464"><a name="pos1464"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> I have never met with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1465"><a name="pos1465"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Have you been able to get any information about his whereabouts?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1466"><a name="pos1466"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> When I attended a funeral at ...(indistinct) I heard from a person call Zakariah and he told me that he was - he attended Philip's Sejanamane's funeral in Tanzania, then I asked him where Tax was and he said to me Tax was not there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1467"><a name="pos1467"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> You said that Tax was staying with his wife and the sister-in-law on the same property.  Have either his wife or the sister-in-law told you what happened to Tax?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1468"><a name="pos1468"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Chairperson, I must object to this blatant hearsay.  Why can't the wife and the sister be called to come and tell you?  No foundation has been laid to show that this is the best evidence available to the victims.  If it's important evidence to them and they want to give hearsay evidence, they've got to lay a foundation and the foundation can only be that this is the best evidence they've got. Now we know that the sister and the wife are the people who can come and say this.  We don't know whether they're alive or dead, but if they're dead, well that's a different matter, but surely some foundation has to be laid.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1469"><a name="pos1469"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What's your response to that, Mr Malindi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1470"><a name="pos1470"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Chairperson, I will ask one question which will determine the status of at least one of the two women.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1471"><a name="pos1471"></a>Since the unbanning of the ANC, have you been able to meet Tax's wife?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1472"><a name="pos1472"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> I have never met her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1473"><a name="pos1473"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Do you know if she ever came back from Lesotho or not, Tax's wife?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1474"><a name="pos1474"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> Her family told me that they were still looking for Dimakatzo, that is my son's wife and they don't know where she was.  Then I also told them that I'm also looking for my son.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1475"><a name="pos1475"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Ms Sejanamane you say Tax was being harassed, if I remember well, before he went into exile, by the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1476"><a name="pos1476"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> That is correct, that is so, they used to harass him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1477"><a name="pos1477"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Do you have anything that you can give to the Committee to show that indeed he was harassed by the police before he went into exile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1478"><a name="pos1478"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> I do have some papers with me, even the day they detained him from his room at my place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1479"><a name="pos1479"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Chairperson at a stage I beg leave to hand up some newspaper cuttings which I have not had an opportunity to go through except to peruse them quickly.  I think one of them does not have a date, because the family cut the clipping without putting a date or pulling out the whole page.  Chairperson, I don't know how you would like me to do it.  I could either quickly go through the relevant portions and put them on record or I could hand them up to the Committee to put them on record.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1480"><a name="pos1480"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Has your opponent seen them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1481"><a name="pos1481"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Chairperson, I would also like to say something.  I don't want to interrupt you but I'd also like to say something about this at a convenient time.  I don't know whether now is a convenient time.  The question is simply, how is this relevant, Chairperson?  How is this relevant to this application whether he was arrested or harassed as the witness says or not.  I don't see the relevance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1482"><a name="pos1482"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Malindi, are you wanting to say that he went into exile through the harassment, the continuous harassment, the detention, because the tenor of the evidence we heard from the applicants is that he was an MK member away from home, that's basically what it is, so that he was detained, the newspapers might say that, it's neither here nor there, because he was actually away from home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1483"><a name="pos1483"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Indeed Chairperson, except that we may submit at the end of the hearing that Sejanamane was not the kind of person who would have sold out so easily after having borne harassment, gone into exile, maybe he could have sold out before even going into the ...(indistinct) of going into exile.  That is the only basis upon which we will submit that reports are relevant at a stage, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1484"><a name="pos1484"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think there should be foundation as well before I accept that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1485"><a name="pos1485"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Chairperson, can I try to make it easy for my Learned Friend here?  If my Learned Friend assures you that the newspaper reports show harassment other than just a normal arrest and detention, then I believe that he should then have the right to hand it up to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1486"><a name="pos1486"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Or wouldn't you want to see them first, or they can come directly, ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1487"><a name="pos1487"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Perhaps we should just look at them first, Chairperson, but I'm just concerned about the relevance.  We've heard so much irrelevance in this hearing and we know we're short of time, as I'm told, so I don't want to prolong the matter, I'd rather prefer to shorten it and if its going to be irrelevant, well the obviously it shouldn't be allowed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1488"><a name="pos1488"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You may hand them up to us Mr Malindi.  How many are they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1489"><a name="pos1489"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Chairperson, may I establish that from Mr Koopedi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1490"><a name="pos1490"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I have copies in my possession which have been handed up.  The Newspaper is the Friend, Bloemfontein Tuesday January 13 1981 and the headlines are, there is a picture of a man, written Mr Thebogo Sejanamane and the head lines that:  "Azapo man flees" and written by Seroto Seroto. I will mark that A and the second one is in Afrikaans, I don't know form which newspaper, is that:   "A funeral..." and the third paragraph of this paper cutting says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1491"><a name="pos1491"></a>"Three members of the Bloemfontein branch of AZAPO, Tax Sejanamane, Matata Lesapo and A.  Sekware  were taken into custody before the funeral"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1492"><a name="pos1492"></a>That would be marked B.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1493"><a name="pos1493"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Chairperson, may I remind you that we've already got an A and a B, so this would have to be C and D respectively.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1494"><a name="pos1494"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Oh yes and the small one would be D and the last one would be E.  It's also from the Friend, Bloemfontein, Wednesday 14 May 1980. The headlines:  "Manaung teacher is detained" it says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1495"><a name="pos1495"></a>"The Treasurer of the Bloemfontein branch of the Azanian People's Organisation, (AZAPO) and a teacher at ...(indistinct) Higher Primary School, Mr Thebogo Godfrey Sejanamane, was detained by the Security Police last weekend."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1496"><a name="pos1496"></a>I would force Mr Joe Jafta to just make copies, if we have such facility here, that everybody would be in possession of these three and for the interim, could you give the list to Mrs Sejanamane, whilst you get Joe Jafta?  You may proceed Mr Malindi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1497"><a name="pos1497"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Thank you Chairperson.  Ms Sejanamane, it has already been read onto the record that your son was a teacher, do you confirm that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1498"><a name="pos1498"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> That is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1499"><a name="pos1499"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Besides the incidents of harassment that are contained in the newspaper clipping that have been handed up as exhibits, were there other incidents that you know of?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1500"><a name="pos1500"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> I do not understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1501"><a name="pos1501"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> You have just given the Committee some newspapers that show that your son was an activist and was harassed by the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1502"><a name="pos1502"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> With great respect Chairperson, my Learned Friend keeps on saying harassed, harassed.  What the news clippings show, that you have read to us, show that he was arrested.  Now unless my Learned Friend wants to argue that arrest is the same as harassed, I would ask him not to use the word harassed, because at that stage, those arrests may have been lawful, I don't know whether they were or weren't, but he can't just assume that they were harassment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1503"><a name="pos1503"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The speaker's mike.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1504"><a name="pos1504"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...continual arrest does not suggest harassment, it might be lawful or unlawful, so we don't know the circumstances, unless you lay a basis for that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1505"><a name="pos1505"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Chairperson, I'll refrain from using the word harass or harassment.  Mrs Sejanamane, except the incidents in the newspaper clippings involving your son and the police, were there other incidents that you know of?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1506"><a name="pos1506"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1507"><a name="pos1507"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Were they also carried in the local newspapers or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1508"><a name="pos1508"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> No they did not appear in the newspapers, that is when he came back from a detention, at my home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1509"><a name="pos1509"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Thank you Chairperson, no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1510"><a name="pos1510"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MALINDI</p>
<p class="line" id="line1511"><a name="pos1511"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Malindi.  Mr Visser, any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1512"><a name="pos1512"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1513"><a name="pos1513"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR VISSER:</span> Mrs Sejanamane, I'm not sure I understood what you said.  You were asked by your counsel whether you had contact with Tax Sejanamane when he was in Lesotho.  Can you just tell us again what your answer was to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1514"><a name="pos1514"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> The contact that we had was at a wedding, that is when he married the ...(indistinct) daughter, that is when I first saw him in Maseru.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1515"><a name="pos1515"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Can you remember when that was, what the date was, of that marriage ceremony?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1516"><a name="pos1516"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> If I'm not mistaken, it can be around 1982 when they got married.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1517"><a name="pos1517"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you ever see him again after that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1518"><a name="pos1518"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> No, I never saw him again, the only person I met was my daughter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1519"><a name="pos1519"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Who's your daughter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1520"><a name="pos1520"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> That's Margaret.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1521"><a name="pos1521"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What's she got to do with anything?  Who is your daughter, what did she do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1522"><a name="pos1522"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That's the one that saw him again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1523"><a name="pos1523"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> She visited there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1524"><a name="pos1524"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Your daughter Margaret, did she go to Lesotho to visit Tax, is that what you're saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1525"><a name="pos1525"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> I don't know whether she visited Tax, or she just visited the place, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1526"><a name="pos1526"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well, I'll give you an opportunity to explain, I'm at a loss to understand the relevance of Margaret, unless I've missed out on something.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1527"><a name="pos1527"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Did Margaret see Tax when she was in Lesotho?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1528"><a name="pos1528"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> Yes, she told me that she saw him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1529"><a name="pos1529"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Is that perhaps what you refer to in paragraph 6 of your statement at page 38 of the bundle when you say that you later learned, that's after he left the country to go into exile, that Tax had been seen in Maseru in the mid eighties?  Is that what you learned from Margaret, is that what you're saying?  Or from whom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1530"><a name="pos1530"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> No that one I heard from Zachariah.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1531"><a name="pos1531"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright, but the fact is you actually saw him in 1982, not so, in Lesotho?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1532"><a name="pos1532"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1533"><a name="pos1533"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Now let me just ask you this again to make it absolutely clear.  After the wedding in 1982, did you ever see Tax again in Lesotho?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1534"><a name="pos1534"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> No I haven't seen him</p>
<p class="line" id="line1535"><a name="pos1535"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you.  Those newspaper reports, appear to suggest that Tax was a supporter of AZAPO, does that accord with your knowledge?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1536"><a name="pos1536"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> Well, I don't know, I did not understand politics then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1537"><a name="pos1537"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  Because you say in your statement in paragraph 5</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1538"><a name="pos1538"></a>"Tax left the country",</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1539"><a name="pos1539"></a>that's the Republic,</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1540"><a name="pos1540"></a>"for exile, to join the ANC in 1981",</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1541"><a name="pos1541"></a>that's how you understood it.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1542"><a name="pos1542"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> When he arrived at Maseru, he was welcomed by Zachariah Skwera and he told me that he was a member of the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1543"><a name="pos1543"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright.  Fine.  Now you referred to a funeral in Tanzania.  Is it the newspaper report that referred to a funeral?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1544"><a name="pos1544"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> No, no, you're right, she spoke about a funeral.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1545"><a name="pos1545"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I believe you spoke of a funeral where Tax was not present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1546"><a name="pos1546"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> That is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1547"><a name="pos1547"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> When was this funeral?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1548"><a name="pos1548"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> I don't know the year, but it was at a place called Freedom Square, here in Bloemfontein.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1549"><a name="pos1549"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> The funeral was here in Bloemfontein?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1550"><a name="pos1550"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1551"><a name="pos1551"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright and whose funeral was it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1552"><a name="pos1552"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> We used to call her Old Maid Sejanamane, but she got married to Blom family.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1553"><a name="pos1553"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I'm sorry.  You know I'm trying to make it easier, but it seems I'm making it more complicated as I go along.  The person who died, was that a relation of yours?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1554"><a name="pos1554"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> Yes, it's my husband's family.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1555"><a name="pos1555"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I see.  And where did he die, or she die?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1556"><a name="pos1556"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> Here in Bloemfontein at a place called Freedom Square.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1557"><a name="pos1557"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright.  Was it a man or a woman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1558"><a name="pos1558"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> She was a woman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1559"><a name="pos1559"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I see.  You see, what confuses me and I'll tell you immediately what confuses me, is didn't you also have another close relation ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1560"><a name="pos1560"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Can I clear it up for you, Mr Visser?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1561"><a name="pos1561"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Please do Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1562"><a name="pos1562"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You see when she testified in Chief, she said that at this funeral at Freedom Square, she spoke to Zachariah who told her about something that happened somewhere else in Zambia, of another funeral in Zambia and that's where you're getting confused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1563"><a name="pos1563"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1564"><a name="pos1564"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I accept what Commissioner and what the witness has confirmed.  Now I want to refer you then to page 39, paragraph 8.  That says that your second son, Philip Nkuntsi Sejanamane, also left for exile in about 1983/1984, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1565"><a name="pos1565"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1566"><a name="pos1566"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes and I apologise to you, but I was confused, I thought that you were referring to his funeral in Tanzania, that's why I couldn't understand, for the life of me, how you got to Freedom Square in Bloemfontein.  But thank you.  Now are you sure that he died or were you told that he died in Tanzania in 1989?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1567"><a name="pos1567"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> I got this telegram that I have but it was not sent at my own address, I received it from this address that appears on the envelope.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1568"><a name="pos1568"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Would you mind terribly if we had a look at that telegram because we're very interested to see what that telegram says?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1569"><a name="pos1569"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> I do not have a problem, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1570"><a name="pos1570"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Chairperson, perhaps to save time, could I ask for a short adjournment for us to look at the newspaper reports to see whether there's anything we have to put to this witness and to look at the telegram.  It may shorten proceedings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1571"><a name="pos1571"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Certainly.  We'll take a short adjournment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1572"><a name="pos1572"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line1573"><a name="pos1573"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line1574"><a name="pos1574"></a><span class="speaker">MARIA DIJENG SEJANAMANE:</span> (s.u.o.)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1575"><a name="pos1575"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Mr Visser, have you looked at the newspaper cuttings and the telegram and I suppose this fax?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1576"><a name="pos1576"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, Chairperson, I have.  We received a copy.  Could I suggest that you accept this as Exhibit F and I do have just one or two questions on this document to the witness.  Mrs Sejanamane, oh let me just put on my headphones, otherwise I might not understand what you're saying.  You say you received this telegram, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1577"><a name="pos1577"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1578"><a name="pos1578"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And the dates on this paragraph in the fourth line on the left-hand side from the top appears to be 08/18 which, if that is the date, it would mean the 18th of August, is that how you read it?  You see, because I can't make out from my copy of Exhibit F, what the date stamp on the round stamp is, I'm not sure whether it will appear from the original.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1579"><a name="pos1579"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Malindi establish, because he's next to the witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1580"><a name="pos1580"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> ...(indistinct - speaking simultaneously)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1581"><a name="pos1581"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Do you have the original?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1582"><a name="pos1582"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> There might be a date on the envelope, Chairperson.  I seem to recall in past years when I received telegrams that there was a date on the envelope itself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1583"><a name="pos1583"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No Mr Mapoma, give it to young eyes, they will be able to see.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1584"><a name="pos1584"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> It's definitely in 89.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1585"><a name="pos1585"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1586"><a name="pos1586"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ... a month or a day there, no, no, on the envelope.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1587"><a name="pos1587"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> On the envelope Chairperson, what appears is 18/invisible figure and then 1989.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1588"><a name="pos1588"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you Chairperson, I think nothing much turns on it, but I think we can assume prima facie that this telegram is either dated or was sent on the 18th of August 1989.  What I want to ask you, Mrs Sejanamane, is do you know who the person is that signed or sent this telegram?  It appears to me a person with the name of Sidiso Mefenyana.  Do you know who that person is?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1589"><a name="pos1589"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> I don't know him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1590"><a name="pos1590"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> But he gave his address, or a contact address as a P O Box in Lusaka.  You noticed that in the telegram didn't you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1591"><a name="pos1591"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1592"><a name="pos1592"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Who did you assume sent this telegram to you?  Did you assume - let me ask you straight out, did you assume this was a telegram sent to you by the ANC from Lusaka?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1593"><a name="pos1593"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> I did not understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1594"><a name="pos1594"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well, who else would have sent you this telegram?  Your second son went to join the ANC not so, in exile.  Isn't it reasonable to assume that it's on behalf of the ANC that this telegram was sent to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1595"><a name="pos1595"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> I think the person who could send me the telegram was his brother, because they were two.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1596"><a name="pos1596"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Hang on I don't understand this, whose brother are you talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1597"><a name="pos1597"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> I'm referring to Godfrey Tax.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1598"><a name="pos1598"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Tax's brother?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1599"><a name="pos1599"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> No, what she's trying to say is that she assumed that the other brother, in other words Tax, had somehow made sure the telegram came to her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1600"><a name="pos1600"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Is that correct?  Is that what you thought?  You thought it was Tax that had the telegram sent to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1601"><a name="pos1601"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> It is not Tax, as it appears, but the only person I thought who could send me a telegram after his brother's death, could be Godfrey, that is Tax Sejanamane.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1602"><a name="pos1602"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you, I understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1603"><a name="pos1603"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Mr Visser, just for the record, I looked at the envelope and the original.  The date is a Roman 8, in other words (viii), and that's why, because it's not in ordinary numerals, but if you look at it carefully, that's what it is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1604"><a name="pos1604"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, I'm not concerned about the date any longer, it's more or less August 1989.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1605"><a name="pos1605"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Yes, I'm just confirming that it is in fact August.  It is a Roman 8, that's why it wasn't that visible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1606"><a name="pos1606"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you Chairperson.  Were you concerned when you got this telegram?  You obviously were distressed, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1607"><a name="pos1607"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> Yes, I was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1608"><a name="pos1608"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And this telegram invited you and your husband to obtain further details if you contacted the sender of the telegram at a P O Box number in Lusaka.  You understood that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1609"><a name="pos1609"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1610"><a name="pos1610"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you write to that P O Box number, to this person, to request for details of the death of your son?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1611"><a name="pos1611"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> No, we did not write.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1612"><a name="pos1612"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Was there any particular reason why you didn't follow that up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1613"><a name="pos1613"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> I did not do that because my husband was sick with a stroke.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1614"><a name="pos1614"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You told the Committee, well I'm not even going to ask you that.  You said in paragraph 11 at page 39, that could possibly be shown to you, that you're opposing the granting of amnesty to the applicant, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1615"><a name="pos1615"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1616"><a name="pos1616"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And you said the reason was because you are not convinced by their story about the disappearance of Tax, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1617"><a name="pos1617"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1618"><a name="pos1618"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What story is that that you refer to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1619"><a name="pos1619"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> I am not satisfied because they are applying for amnesty, but I don't know in regard with what, I don't know what they did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1620"><a name="pos1620"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You said in March of this year, 2000, you said you were not convinced by the applicants' story.  To what story are you referring?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1621"><a name="pos1621"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> That is when they say they are applying for amnesty, that's when they say they apply for amnesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1622"><a name="pos1622"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> But that's not a story, that's an application.  What is the story you're talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1623"><a name="pos1623"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> That is their application for amnesty.  Can you really apply for amnesty if you haven't done anything?  You have to explain why you're asking for an amnesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1624"><a name="pos1624"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And how did you know that the applicants did not explain why they were applying for amnesty in March of this year?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1625"><a name="pos1625"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> I learned that they were applying for amnesty through the TRC.  Kaiser Mbatha had a form from Maseru.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1626"><a name="pos1626"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> So you really don't know why you're opposing this application, is that what it boils down to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1627"><a name="pos1627"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> I am against their applications because I want to know where my children are, as they were arresting my kids.  I just want to know where my kids are.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1628"><a name="pos1628"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And if they can't tell you because they don't know, what then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1629"><a name="pos1629"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> How will I forgive them, if they don't tell me where my sons are?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1630"><a name="pos1630"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mrs Sejanamane please, if they don't know where they are, how can they tell you?  Are you assuming they must know, is that the point?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1631"><a name="pos1631"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> How do they apply for an amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1632"><a name="pos1632"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I have no further questions.  Just a moment, Mr Chairman.  My attorney believes that I should just explain some of the questions Chairperson.  It's really argument and I can't ask the witness, but we will refer you in argument to the statement of the ANC to the TRC from which we will show you that the name of Philip who died allegedly of natural causes in Tanzania, is also not mentioned in the list and we will make certain submission to you in that regard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1633"><a name="pos1633"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR VISSER</p>
<p class="line" id="line1634"><a name="pos1634"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Visser.  Mr Mapoma, any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1635"><a name="pos1635"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Thank you Chairperson, I have no questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1636"><a name="pos1636"></a>NO QUESTIONS BY MR MAPOMA</p>
<p class="line" id="line1637"><a name="pos1637"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Any re-examination Mr Malindi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1638"><a name="pos1638"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> None, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1639"><a name="pos1639"></a>NO RE-EXAMINATION BY MR MALINDI</p>
<p class="line" id="line1640"><a name="pos1640"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Malindi.   Any questions from the Panel Mr Lax?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1641"><a name="pos1641"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry Chair, I omitted to ask the others this question and it suddenly struck me as a relevant one.  Mrs Sejanamane, do you know whether Tax or his wife had any children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1642"><a name="pos1642"></a><span class="speaker">MS SEJANAMANE:</span> I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1643"><a name="pos1643"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Thank you Chairperson, that's all I wanted to ask.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1644"><a name="pos1644"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Thank you.  I've got no questions Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1645"><a name="pos1645"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Mr Malindi and Mr Koopedi, would you follow up with your clients with regard to the other people and the other families, just so we can have a clear picture of who the relatives and dependants are in case it becomes a relevant issue in due course?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1646"><a name="pos1646"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> We shall do so, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1647"><a name="pos1647"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Lax.  I don't think there's anything that arises from what members of my Panel said.  Before - this brings us to the conclusion of the matter.  As I discussed with counsel in chambers, ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1648"><a name="pos1648"></a>	Forgive me Mrs Sejanamane, we have finished with your evidence.  You can be released and go back to your seat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1649"><a name="pos1649"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line1650"><a name="pos1650"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> As I discussed with counsel in chambers, I am worried when listening to the evidence in this matter, there are certain people who have been here and since they have not been called and because I am interested, I take it upon myself that these people should be subpoenaed.  I have identified some, as I look at the bundle of papers here.  They would be Bulelo, who allegedly came with the photograph of K K and I would say to you, Mr Mapoma, take advantage of the presence of Ms Ngono who testified before me to get full particularity regarding that person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1651"><a name="pos1651"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> It's Bulelo, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1652"><a name="pos1652"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The speaker's mike.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1653"><a name="pos1653"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ... Major Busisiwe Benedikatha Buthelezi.  This would appear, it's faxed from the South African National Defence, it's easy to trace that person.  I am interested in Nathaniel Mona Mtunya.  It is my view also in addition to what I said to counsel in chamber that Tsietsi Mokhele is apparently alive and somewhere around, I want to hear him as well.  I don't know from these which I have identified, that is Khadi Lindelwa Mabece and Trevor James Tsepo Pitso, if any of the legal representatives would be interested in those people, but I have identified them at least for anybody, other than the people you would come with.  What I want us to do and I've implored the legal representatives, that time is of the essence, that if there is a legal representative who wants somebody to be subpoenaed by the TRC, please do so as soon as possible.  As matters stand, we have now established that this matter, there won't be argument, this matter will be further heard between the 4th and 8th December 2000 at JISS Centre, Joe has undertaken to make all the logistical arrangements, but apparently a venue which he could obtain is JISS Centre, Mayfair Johannesburg where we actually started and it will continue from the 4th to the 8th.  I'm mindful that there are the municipality elections on the 5th and if that is declared a public holiday, people are free to go and vote, I don't want to stand in the way of anybody's constitutional right to case his vote for whichever party he prefers.  And because I have mentioned a few people, could we have an agreement that on the 4th we start at 9.00 a.m. at Jiss Centre, on the 4th of December 2000?  So this matter will stand adjourned to the 4th of December at JISS Centre, but I must firstly say and I want to say this to the people of this church, that thank you very much for the venue and the treatment we have received.  I have to start doing exercises because I'm bulging because of the nice food here.  Thank you very much it is most appreciated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1654"><a name="pos1654"></a>	Thank you to the legal representatives.  I may have been quiet most of the time, but your assistance has been invaluable.  That is highly appreciated and I'm also indebted that this is done in the spirit in which it is done normally and that is gratifying to me, speaking for myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1655"><a name="pos1655"></a>	I want to thank the translators. I think you thought you would go home early for the Christmas holidays.  I'm sorry to call you back on the 4th, but thank you for your assistance and if I have stretched you, it was not intentional it was because I was busy with what I had before me and time was, in most instances, not my priority and that is my biggest weakness, I don't look at time when do you finish work, but bear with me, take it that I was not punishing you, your assistance is highly appreciated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1656"><a name="pos1656"></a>	To the victims, I would say, you have been at JISS Centre, you came here and you stayed throughout in attendance.  Thank you for the attendance.  The rest I will conclude with a JISS Centre when we are concluding this matter because I know for now, there is a gripe that we don't know what happened to our victims, but it is not time for me now to comment on that at this juncture. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1657"><a name="pos1657"></a>	I am not forgetting the applicants.  Thank you for coming in and Mr Robertshaw, you showed great interest.  You stayed in throughout.  Thank you, if we have taken you away from your work, we thank you for your co-operation you've shown.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1658"><a name="pos1658"></a>	We will adjourn now until the 4th of December 2000 at JISS Centre.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1659"><a name="pos1659"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Chairperson, just before you rise, it's not that I want the last word, but there are just two issues that I have to raise with you.  The first issue is that we did not seem to get the fourth name that you mentioned.  You mentioned Mr Buthelezi, Mtunya and Bulelo, but we didn't hear the fourth name that you mentioned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1660"><a name="pos1660"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1661"><a name="pos1661"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mokhele?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1662"><a name="pos1662"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(indistinct - mike not on)</p>

<p class="line" id="line1665"><a name="pos1665"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Tsietsi?  Yes, I'm sorry, that's the person at page 30 of the record.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1666"><a name="pos1666"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> . ..(indistinct - mike not on) those are the applicants.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1667"><a name="pos1667"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you Chairperson.  Let me just place on record, we have no interest in people like Khadi and so on, in fact we would have argued that his evidence was irrelevant to this application anyway, so we would not add to that list as present advised.  Chairperson, there remain two things, one is through the efforts of Mr Mapoma, for which we thank him, he has obtained a photocopy, or rather a fax from which photocopies have been made of the original statement taken from Ms Thobeka Ngono and for completeness of the record, could we ask you to accept that as Exhibit G?  My Learned Friend Mr Mapoma, has assured me that he's compared that statement to the statement which appears in your bundle, and it's identical, so it is handed to you for you to check for yourself, if you wish and then lastly Chairperson - Oh if there aren't copies, please take mine.  Chairperson last issue is we would obviously need a record because it's most helpful, particularly during Argument and it often serves as to avoid arguments as to what witnesses said or didn't say.  Could you perhaps use your auspices in order to ensure that we might be able to get a record of these proceedings for these past two days as soon as possible, so that we can be properly prepared when we appear before you again on the 4th of December?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1668"><a name="pos1668"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you for that reminder.  It's actually of great assistance because you know after some time, sometimes your notes don't even make sense to yourself, who you took and if we have this transcription now - Mr Mapoma I would revert to you.  Please I am not in Cape Town next week, I'm in a hearing.  Utilise next week that that must be ready and I say when I get to Cape Town on the 27th of this month, I want to see that transcript.  You can even phone Adv Martin Coetzee that it is a direct tip from me, that on the 27th I want to see that transcript on my desk, not that it is being readied, I must walk in and find it on my desk.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1669"><a name="pos1669"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> As the Chairperson pleases.</p>
