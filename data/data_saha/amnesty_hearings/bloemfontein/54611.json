Just to put on record Mr Chairman inasfar as the victim is concerned Mr Chairman, a police constable Mr Makaloi I was in contact with my colleague in Cape Town, Ms Thabile Thabeta who forwarded to me a copy of the notice served on the victim and the fact that she had telephoned his station and he was told that he was on his way, which thing I also did and I was told that he was on his way.  During lunch time, no before lunch time I had requested one of the policeman in this hearing to check if he has arrived but he had not arrived and the policeman took it upon himself to phone the police station and the report he gave me is that they told him that they would look for him to tell him to come.  During lunch time, just after talking to members of the Committee in chambers the said policeman came back to me and said that he has phoned again to check from the person he spoke to before and it's now that he got another explanation that this person has left for Bloemfontein but he comes from Aliwal North.",

To sum up what is said there Mr Chairman and members of the Committee, it is the judgment by the Court and the Court came out very clearly that this was a politically motivated offence and the accused then were Apla members and they acted under the instruction of the organisation.\n\tThen I refer Mr Chairman and members of the Committee to the bundle which is the application, page 32 to page 34, that is the letter from the office of the Attorney General endorsing what has been said by the magistrate to the pages I've referred members of the Committee.
