<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>MR KOPI:   (s.u.o.)</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Now Mr Kopi, yesterday we were at the stage when you were giving hypothetical questions when I asked you about the times when you left the office and time when you got back to the office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think you should take your hand from your mouth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> As the Chair pleases.  We were at the stage where you were given hypothetical answers to my questions about when you left the office and when you got back to the office.  Do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> Yes Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Tell us, do you agree with me that you should have, you must have left the office at about twelve on that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> Sir, I shall explain the best way.  When you the informer phones you and say to you let us meet between twelve and half past twelve I'm the first person to leave and arrive first at our meeting point.  Maybe we agree that there are point A and point B, if you go to point A you find that point A is far from point B.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> The question, for the last time.  You told us that you arrived back at the office at about eleven and you stayed for about thirty minutes.  You must have left the office at about twelve or half past twelve.  Do you agree with me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> Let me clear it firstly.  I said I could have stayed in the office 30 to 35 minutes, left the office at about half past twelve.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That would be about half past eleven, surely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> But I'm saying the latest Chairperson to give him leeway.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> If the appointment was between half past twelve and to one, then I would ...[indistinct]</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> ...[indistinct] to the office about twelve thirty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Now tell me what is it that you recall specifically  that you got back to the office about eleven on the first occasion and you got back again at about three thirty but you can't recall at about what time you left?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> It was because my informer told me a sensitive message so that I should come back early so that I should report back to my commander.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Now again what you've said is not an answer to the question.  I will proceed to the next question.  You told us that you remained in the office until left about four because you had an appointment for half past four.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> Let me put it clearly that I arrived at half past three then I went to the fifth floor, then I went to the toilet. Before I went to the toilet I saw that those people were still in the toilet and when I returned I saw them again in the toilet then I collected my belongings and then went down to the fourth floor so that we should discuss this issue with my commander.  At 4 o'clock, then I left because because I knew that I have an appointment at half past four.  I must report first home so that I should know they need.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman may I enquire whether the interpretation was correct with regard to having seen them in the toilet?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Mr Visser has unfortunately has not listened to the witness, but maybe ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well let's just ask him where did you see them when you were on the fifth floor, where did you see these people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> When I got to the toilet, I passed through the kitchen, I saw them in the kitchen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Now what appointment did you have at half past four.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> It's with another informer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Was it your informer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> That is correct, that's my informer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Now did you go back to the office after you saw the informer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> No, I didn't go back to the office.  I contacted my sectional head and reported to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Well, you know I find it strange that on a day when there was so important work to be done in the office you were going on with routine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> We wanted to find out what would the informer say. Maybe he was going to tell us about the nineteen people but he told me something different which I'm not able to tell you now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Now, Mr Kopi, I'm told that you are the person who drove the vehicle, actually took the people to Glen police station after the ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> The are times when I took these people to that Glen police station.  It might be the second or the third day but I'm not sure, but I know that I did take these people to Glen Police Station.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> But it was yourself and Motsamai who took them to Glen Police Station on the first day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> No, on the first day I didn't take anybody to Glen Police Station.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> That was on the day subsequent to the 6th, you took them to the doctor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> I don't understand, do you mean the second or the third day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Days you drove them to the doctor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> The were people whom I took them to the doctor, but I remember the day where I took these specific people to the doctor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Took them together with Motsamai.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> If there was nobody who would accompany me to take these people to the doctor, my sectional commander would send somebody to accompany me to that particular doctor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Now is it not correct, Mr Kopi, that you were Du Plooy's interpreter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> If there was necessary for you to interpret you'd do so but if you were still interpreting and the informer phones you then you leave that work of interpreting then you consult your informer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> You see I'm told that on that day you were interpreting for Du Plooy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> No, I didn't interpret for Du Plooy at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> You must have knew he was your interpreter, he ...[indistinct]  your officer, he called you back into the office and he needed an interpreter, you must have interpreted for him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> He may call you to his office and say to you, then he say I want you to interpret for me then you would tell him that I have an appointment with an informer.  If that informer phones me, then you do that.  Occasionally.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We want to know, did you in fact interpret for Du Plooy on this first day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> I did say that, I haven't interpreted for Du Plooy on the first day.  I just forget the white person whom I was with on that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He didn't interpret for Du Plooy, right, that's what you say, on the first day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> Yes I didn't interpret for Du Plooy on the first day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> For anyone else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He interpreted for a white officer, he cannot remember which it was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Who do you think it could have been?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> At times you work with many white officers so I just forgot whom I did interpret for.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Do you remember that in your evidence in chief and in your evidence throughout cross-examination you told us that what you did was to take particulars of persons, you never mentioned that you interpreted for any white officer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> My learned friend didn't listen to the evidence, Mr Chairman, he made it quite clear that he acted as an interpreter when necessary.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a>:	But there was a white officer sitting there who was taking notes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> My recollection, Mr Chairman, was that this was his functions generally that's what he does generally, the office, but when he came to this specific day, he told us that he came in at about eleven, he spoke to Du Plooy, and then he started picking people from the office.  He stayed there for about fifteen minutes.  I asked him what he was doing, he said that he was taking their details, their particulars, and if they didn't want to give information, he took them back.  He spoke to two persons, two to three persons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I interrogated one or two people, when we interrogated them they will be arrestee, I raised questions about the word, myself and a white officer taking notes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> As the chair pleases.  Now, Mr Kopi, I am told you have never had an informer, in fact.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> The person who says I did not have informers, is playing, he wanted me to tell who my informers were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Were your informers, the informers you saw on that day registered or not registered?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> Others were registered, others were not registered but the one I met on that day he was registered.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Now, every informer has got a number, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And what is the difference between the number of a registered informer and a number of an unregistered informer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> The one which is registered, I would say, OFS7 only, the other one it will start with, there were numbers before the symbols there, then they would just put it on the particular paper.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And what did you say, how did you describe the</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a>number of the registered informer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> The registered informer would have a particular number and the unregistered informer would have a number again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> You told us that an unregistered informer's number starts with OFS.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> I said a registered informer would have OFS or 7 then other unregistered numbers would have a number inbetween.  Would have numbers inbetween then it would say unregistered informer then they would put his number in front.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> A registered informer would have a number inbetween, inbetween what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> It would unregistered informer then after that it would be a number.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, my attention has been drawn to the fact that my learned friend, Mr Memani, has his hand in front of his mouth and apparently his voice is not coming through.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I've already drawn his attention to that and asked him to take his hand away from his mouth, he apparently has difficulty in sitting up without holding his chin.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Now, Mr Kopi, what is, and how does the number of the registered informer appear?</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> Sir, I've already explained that.  Do you need the number for unregistered informer or registered informer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Mr, I told you, you told us about the number of an unregistered informer and I'm saying now tell us about the number of the registered informer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Mr Chairman, really, I wonder if Mr Memani could explain where this cross-examination is leading.  It seems to me to have absolutely nothing to do with the applications.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He said yesterday afternoon that it would become clear I'm still waiting to understand what the purpose of this is.  Mr Memani, you will remember that on the regulations in the Act governing these hearings there is a limited right of cross-examination.  You appear to be determined to prolong it for as long as possible.  I trust that at some stage the purpose of your cross-examination will become clear.  And will you take you hand away from your mouth again are you incapable of sitting up without holding your chin?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> My hand is away from my mouth, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Take it away from your chin.  Sit up as if you're in a court. You aren't slumped here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Mr Chairman, I'm not slumped here, I'm holding on to the side of my face but I'm not slumped.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Will you answer the objection that has now been taken.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Mr Chairman, I've already finalised the aspect that I was dealing with yesterday and that aspect was that I found it strange that he said he would be away for such a long time.  That is why I was asking those questions yesterday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well as far as I'm concerned you have finalised nothing that couldn't have been done in five or ten minutes questioning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Well Mr Chairman it was the witness is not answering the questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, I do object to that, with great respect we all know that the witness has promptly answered all questions and I wouldn't like this to stand uncontested on the record.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Carry on, Mr Memani, what's your next question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Now, Mr Kopi, I was asking you to tell us about how the number of an informer who was registered appears.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Kopi, did you tell us that the number of a registered informer would be "OFS"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> The registered informer would be "OFS" and the men would put 7 in front of "OFS".  The unregistered informer it would be written "unregistered informer", then thereafter he'd put numbers then they, then lastly on the end of that then they would put another number.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Now, my instructions are that you are entirely incorrect that ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> The person who says I am not telling the correct things is the one who is not telling us the correct things.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> But the number of the unregistered informer would begin with OFS and then a number and then something would be put in brackets.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Mr Memani, I'll be prepared to accept that that's the position.  That he's wrong in this and that it's the other way round.  But can you please now explain to me what's the relevance for your application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> He says that he was not at the place where people were being assaulted because he went to see an informer, that he does have informers.  I am then trying, I'm saying to you he was not at any meeting with informers, in fact he did not have informers and I'm trying to test that.  That is why I'm saying to him he must tell us what numbers look like for instance.  Now I'm also told that the number of a registered informer would begin with an S, an S and then you get the number.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> I hear the S for the first time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> That you worked with Mbanjani in the office where information was gathered.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> I haven't worked with Mbanjani.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> In the main, you were an interrogator.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> I said, if you are called and being instructed that you should interrogate, or interpret, you'd do that because that is a command you get from your sectional head.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> No, but, we know that there were field workers for instance we've been told that there were people who worked mainly with the MK and ANC and Mbanjani told us he was mainly in the office doing, listening to the news and so on and I'm told that you worked in that office and that you were also specialising in interrogation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> You tell me that Mbanjani was listening to peoples news.  I don't understand as to whether was I with Mbanjani or I was with those who were investigating.  Can you just clarify your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What he's put to  you is you worked  in the same office with Mbanjani and that you were, although you worked in the same office with him, you were employed there as an interrogator.  That is what he is suggesting to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> I now understand.  At times I got to Mbanjani's office but not, it was not my daily business to do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And in the main you were an interrogator?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> I was interrogating and again I was working with informers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> You are not convincing you know because you had the numbers even muddled up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> That's how I remembered those numbers for</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a>informers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Then what is an SAP5.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> It's a diary.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And an SAP67?</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a>	If I may have a moment Chairperson.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The interpreters were struggling with the word "verslag", it has been interpreted as a report.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Mr Kopi, I'm putting it to you that you did not see any informer on the 6th April 1986?</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> I tell you that I met my informer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And you did not have any informer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> I had informers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> You are saying these things in an attempt to pull yourself away from Fountain Police Station because you know that people were assaulted there on that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> I'm not taking myself out of the situation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> When you came back to the office at about three did you see that people had been beaten up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> I said that I, I said I left there at half past three that I didn't see any person who was beaten.  I went to fifth floor then I took my belongings then I went down to Du Plooy report to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Amongst the people that you conveyed to plan, did you see that some of them were injured.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> No Sir, I didn't see anything because when you put somebody at Glen Police Station before that person goes to Glen Police Station that person is asked as to whether does he have complaints or not.  Then from there if the he has complaints they will open a docket.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And my instructions are that you and Motsamai actually told the police at length not to register any complaints.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> Motsamai is talking his own version, I would not agree to that.  Why did not the person who has assaulted that person didn't take him to Glen Police Station?</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> But that's nonsensical Mr Kopi with due respect.  Now Mr Kopi, the people who were beaten up were, and injured, testified that they were beaten up and that they were conveyed to the police station Glen and no complaints were registered.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> Mr Memani, I said to you that, I still repeat, that there was no person who was assaulted in my presence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And you did not see that the people that you conveyed to Glen were injured?</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> No they were fine, I did not see any person assaulted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Now Mr Kopi, did you not hear, you say that you did not hear, what did you not hear?</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> I just wanted to cough out I did not want to say anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And did you hear after the 6th that the people that were interrogated on the 6th April were beaten up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> No person told me that there were people who have been assaulted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Now, Mr Kopi, when you told us when you were speaking about Violent Street, that the person who named it Violent Street was a member of the public.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a>	Or let me rephrase that, you told us that the name of the person, the name Violent Street, came as a result of an enquiry that was made by a member of the public who was in the offices.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well he told us there was a sticker up there reading "Violent Street" and that a person was brought up from the fourth floor to the fifth floor who saw this sticker and then asked: "Is this Violent Street, is that not his evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> It's the same question put differently, Chairperson.  Now, Mr Kopi, were there toilets on the first floor?</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you mean that questions, toilets on the first floor?</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Yes, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a>	Were there toilets on the first floor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> You are not talking about the first floor, you are not talking about the fifth floor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, he's talking about the first floor, he said specifically.  Who occupied the first floor?</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> From first floor to third floor is DK.</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is who?  Who occupies the first to the first to the third floor?</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> District Commander's office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you know if he had toilets on the first floor?</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> From first floor to fifth floor there were toilets.</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> You see I'm asking you this question because in your evidence you said that this person was being interrogated on the fourth floor and wanted to go to the toilet on the fifth floor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What has that got to do with toilets on the first floor?</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Well, Chairperson, you know that when sometimes ...[indistinct] the question by asking a person questions which might not be directly in point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, I don't know, you have been doing that for several hours now and I don't see the point of it and as I pointed out to you, you have a limited right of cross-examination.  Bear that in mind, Mr Memani.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> We haven't sat for an hour this morning, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a>	Now, Mr Kopi, I'm putting it to you that it was, what you told us yesterday was a lie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> I tell you what I told you yesterday is the truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Why would a person have chosen to go to the fifth floor if there were toilets on the fourth floor?</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> There are toilets on the fourth floor.  He just wanted to stretch his legs.  Then you take him from the fourth floor to the fifth floor so that he would be able to stretch his legs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Mr Memani, you said that we hadn't sat for an hour yet, but I would have thought that a witness like him, it would not have been impossible to dispose of him in fact in much less than an hour, twenty minutes, fifteen minutes but you have got your own way of cross-examination anyway.</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a>	I want to put questions to you Mr Kopi, you said, did I hear you correctly, you said something like you did take down some notes and left them when you left to go and see an informer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> What notes were they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> I took the particulars of the person I was interrogating, all his particulars, where he attend his school.   I'd say he was in a school at Sungawelo, then I would write those notes to prepare for the person who was going to do the interrogation of saying here is the name, don't struggle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Yourself, personally, you did not seek any information from any one of those people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> Yes I wanted some information from them, that is when I said to him you left here, where were you going, then he said we're going to Lesotho then I said to that person: "What were you going to do"?  Then at the time I received a telephone message saying your informer wants to speak to you.  Then I left those notes, I left them with a person I was with in that office.  Then I'm going to hear the message that person from the phone.  Then I learnt that it with my informer then I, that's when I left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> You said you had interrogated two to three people. Would I be correct to assume that before you moved onto the next one you had finished with the first one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> Yes I've already finished with the first one, then he said we're going to Lesotho then when I said what were you going to do then he kept or she kept quiet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> She didn't give you the information that you wanted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> Yes she didn't give me the information I wanted because I said I'm going to waste time then I went to fetch another one.  I'm not sure as whether it's one person or two persons or three persons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> You were not satisfied with their answers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> Yes I was not satisfied with their answers then I said to myself I'm going to waste time if I continue with that interrogation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> And, well at that point I must mention to you that some of the complainants said they were assaulted because information was sought from them which apparently they did not want to depart, to impart.</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> I will not dispute what he's saying when they say they were not assaulted, they could have been assaulted in my absence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> I will not put that to you because I am not very confident of my recollection as to whether anyone of them said you assaulted them.  I'll leave it at that point but now you'll move onto the next one, to interrogate her, am I right.  Because you feel the first one was wasting your time because she was not answering the questions or giving you the information you wanted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> Yes I did interrogate another one, then he said he doesn't want to continue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> When you speak of interrogation, I must ask you for clarification.  Were you interpreting or were you interrogating?</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> We worked as interpreter as I was with this person we would interrogate the person, all of us, but at the same time I would be the one would be interpreting only.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And the second person that you interrogated, did you get the information that you wanted from her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> I remember that maybe the third one is  the one when - whilst I was busy with her the telephone message arrived then I was called to respond to the phone, then I left everything in that office then I left and then Du Plooy said take the car quickly and go and see your informer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Are you talking about the third person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> Yes I speak of the third person, I remember well, it's the third person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Talk about the second before you talk about the third.  Did you get information you wanted from the second person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> I didn't get any kind of information I sought from him or her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> You were not satisfied?</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> Yes I was not satisfied.</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> However, you did not assault her even though you were not satisfied, Your version is that you did not assault her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> I was not satisfied and I did not assault because if you start to assault that person will tell you a lie then at the end of your interrogation you find that this person has told you a lie.  That is why I don't like that person should be assaulted during interrogation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Then you were interrupted while you were talking to or interrogating the third person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> Yes I remember that is the third person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> You left to go and see your informer and subsequently in the afternoon at half past three you came back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> At that time, when you came back at half past three following the logic of your evidence, you had still not been satisfied within that you had not yet as yet obtained information you had wanted to obtain from the people you wanted to interrogate in the morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> The time when I left I was not satisfied but when I came back I found, I received a different information which we need to follow up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Did you at any stage make a follow up?  You had made a few notes, you were interrupted, you had not got information you wanted, did you after 4 o'clock or whatever, did you make your follow-up and finish up where you had started with regard to those particular individuals?</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> No I didn't continue with the interpreting or the interrogation.  When I arrived I went to fourth floor, I went back to Mr du Plooy then I give him the information I received.  Then Du Plooy said leave at 4 o'clock and go home.  Then half past four, go and see that person you're supposed to see.</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Do you not feel that well, you know, I need to interrogate some people and I was not satisfied, I made some few notes I must follow up that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> He said to me, I will tell you, leave, do that work with your informer, meet your informer at half past four then we'll meet again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is the position that on that day there were teams of people interrogating these nineteen people, there were lots of other members of the security branch there interrogating them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> I remember then it could have been like that because there were many.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> You see the version given to us by at least some of the complainants is that there was such a vicious assault on them and that there were traces and evidence of assault in the form of blood on the walls and the like.</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> I said firstly, nobody was assaulted in my presence and secondly if you talk of blood I haven't seen blood anywhere.</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Mr Memani put it to you that you Motsamai took people to the doctor, when was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> Say a person is sick, I transported many people it's not only specifically involving these nineteen people.  Even before that any person who was sick who was being detained, if Motsamai was near then I would request that I should go with Motsamai and take this person to the doctor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> But wasn't the District Surgeon right down in the same building?</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> The time when I arrived there in 1984 there was no District Surgeon, he has already left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> And 1996, on the 6th April 1996 when the nineteen people ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> 1996?</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> 1986, sorry, when the nineteen people were arrested, wasn't there a District Surgeon on the ground floor or the first floor roundabout?</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> No.  There was no District Surgeon there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Thank you, it had been at another stage then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Memani, have you any further questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> No questions, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MEMANI</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Brink?</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Kopi, during the time that you were at Fountain, did you ever see bags which could go over heads or tubes which were used to blindfold people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> I didn't see those things because I was not using them myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Did you ever hear anyone talk about them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> There was no policeman who came to tell me that there was those kind of things, the bags or tubes in the office or in the offices.</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Were any of the offices where interrogations took place soundproofed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> I'm not sure whether they were soundproof or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Did you ever enquire?</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> You mean about soundproofed?  You'd hear if somebody was screaming or calling, you would hear if somebody was calling or screaming.</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> I beg your pardon, I didn't hear you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> You'd hear if somebody is calling or screaming.</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> If you were in your office, someone could shout from another office then you would hear that, is that the situation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> Yes if the window is open you would hear but if the door and the windows are closed it's not quite possible to hear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Now, can you help me.  Are there any regulations or were there at that time any regulations regarding the requirement that a policewoman should be present when a female detainee was being questioned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> I don't know, I haven't seen a female police, only white female police were present and they were doing clerical work.</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> No the question is were their regulations, to your knowledge which required a policewoman to be present when a female detainee was being interrogated by members of the security branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> I take it you read newspapers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> At times, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> The fact that there had been a number of hearings before the Amnesty Committee, where a large number of security branch or former security branch policeman have gone so far as to admit having murdered activists, you know that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> Yes I saw it on T.V. I read it on the newspapers I listened on the radio.</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> All at about this time '85/'86, a lot of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> Yes I saw that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> But you say that the security branch headquarters at Fountain in Bloemfontein, to your knowledge, absolutely nothing untoward took place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> I would not say that because I do not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> To your knowledge?</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> It's difficult to say they did that because I do not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR BRINK</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you share this office that you've told us of with anybody?  The office on the fifth floor?</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> It was the four of us.  Myself, Melesi, Mafisa, Ngalo, He has since died.</p>

<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Did you keep a pocket diary?</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> The time I arrived they were not using the pocket book.</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Did you sign a register?</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> No we were not signing a register, we were reporting directly to Captain du Plooy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Would he have kept a record of when people reported for duty and when they left?</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> I would not able to affirm that because we reported half past seven and then when we supposed to knock off duty we would report back to him again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">RE-EXAMINATION BY MR VISSER:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  In 1986, what was your rank then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> I was constable.</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you have anything to do with the registration of informers, the paperwork concerning the registration of informers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> My work was to look for informers and to make it possible for them to be registered.</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And would you do the registration or would someone else do the registration in the books.</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOPI:</span> There was a person who was doing the registration.</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR VISSER</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, I beg leave to call my next witness, Commissioner Tsomela.  The Commissioner has indicated that he would give his evidence in English.</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">K TSOMELA:</span> (Sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR VISSER:</span> You may sit down, Commissioner.</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You're a Commissioner and you are in fact are you not, the Deputy Commissioner of the South African Police Service of the Free State.</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> When did you join the South African Police, Commissioner?</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> On the 3rd of May 1968.</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> 1968.  Can we go directly to April 1986 and I want to ask you generally - well first of all, what was your position during 1986 in the South African Police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> I was a Station Commissioner at the ...[inaudible] since 1983.</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Since 1983.  Can it be said that you were a member of the Security Branch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> The uniformed branch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You were in the uniformed branch.  You made an affidavit which you signed and which has been placed before you - it had been introduced in the evidence as Exhibit P65, Mr Chairman.  Do you remember that affidavit Commissioner?</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> I still remember it and I have it in front of me here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, and do you confirm the contents of that affidavit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> I will ...[indistinct]</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Now just generally, the period of the mid 1980's, as far as unrest and violence was concerned in the area of Botshabelo, could you just give the Committee a background of how you remember the situation to have been?</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> Yes, Chairperson, unrest happened sporadically time and again in Botshabelo due to some certain dissatisfaction maybe moreover of students at schools etc., etc.,  which the public or policing or maybe the security branch or the C.I.D. Branch had to investigate some cases etc., etc.  And my position at that stage as I've indicated was that of a Station Commissioner and I was a guardian, the helper and the protector which of each and every individual at the particular police station that I managed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I wonder if I could ask you perhaps if you could speak up a little louder if you will, Commissioner.</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> I will definitely, Sir, I'm sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you.  Would it be correct to say that</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a>around 1985/86 lots of people were arrested and moved through your police station at Botshabelo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> That is true, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> It has been suggested here by an applicant in this case - and that applicant is Mr Ngo, that at the time when you were at Botshabelo Police Station in 1986, there was a large group of students mainly who were arrested by the South African Defence Force in the Ladybrand - I'm sorry I've got this wrong, I'm mixing up the two.  There was, call it a raid, if you like, where people were arrested, a large group approximately 40 people were arrested in the Botshabelo area and brought to your police station.  Are you able today to identify that particular incident or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> No Chairperson I cannot, as I'm saying that sporadic incident happens and the branch commanders of the different units or components lead their duties according to the available crime intelligency.</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> May I then ask you this, if it is suggested by anyone that you as a policeman at Botshabelo, participated in the beating up of arrested persons at Botshabelo, what would be your reaction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> Chairperson, that is totally untrue because</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a>as I've indicated as a guardian, protector and a Station Commissioner that was not my duty.  My duty was to see to the wellbeing of each and every individual that might be detained at my police station to his wellbeing.  And the regulations and police act and standing order says that I should not, under no circumstances, allow an assault to take place in my presence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And are you aware of large scale assaults on any group of persons by members of the security branch from Bloemfontein at your police station at any time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> No Sir, I cannot recall one at the present moment but I think that if there were, dockets should have been opened and I could have instructed that that should be done.</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  Since what date have you become the deputy commissioner of the South African Police in the Free State?</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> On the 1st June 1995 Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  That's the evidence Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR VISSER</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR STANDER:</span> Commissioner, did you ever personally meet Mr Ngo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> I don't know Mr Ngo, Sir.  I cannot point him out at the present moment, I don't know him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Right, thank you very much Mr Chairman, I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR STANDER</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> I don't have any questions thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a>NO QUESTIONS BY MR DU PLESSIS</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MEMANI:</span> Mr Tsomela, we were told about the raid of children from Kwago High School where about 40 to 45 of them are arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> No, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> It might not have been interpreted correctly but I'm saying that we were told about the raid of involving the peoples from Kwago High School in Botshabelo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> Nobody did tell me about any raid Sir.  The fact being that each and every component works according to his crime intelligency to his disposal of which the key is confidential you know, moreover for the affectivity of the duty as such.</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> These children we are told were taken to a police station.</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> I don't disagree about that.  As I've said many, many, many, students moreover - as I've indicated, were held at my police station.</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> But this was one big swoop that was made once.</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> Ja, as I've indicated I don't know about any big group of children who were arrested at one time. As I'm saying</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a>you know that happens sporadically and me myself, as I could not took part actively with those particular raids, I don't know of any big group of a specific incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> These children were not arrested sporadically but it was a planned raid that took place at night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> Ja, that's quite right, I've indicated that you know the raids are not organised by me as a protector and the Station Commissioner.</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> But surely your co-operation would have been required because it was your station.</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> My co-operation would moreover come as far as logistics etc., etc., are concerned of which I think that during the unrest, have had already been given to the necessary individuals who might have needed them like vehicles etc., etc., which maybe have in totality been distributed to individuals who could have  utilised them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Mr Tsomela, this raid took place at night and I believe that you did not work at night ordinarily.</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> That is true I don't work at night ordinarily but my duty during the night, I visit my station sporadically but on that particular night maybe, I don't remember of any, any children who were held at the police station maybe during a sporadic or an unorganised visit of myself.  I never met</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a>such a group myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Well it's obvious that this time it would have been preplanned, you would have been warned in advance that you should be present, that a raid would be carried out in Botshabelo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> By whom?  By whom Sir, be warned by whom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> By security branch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> They could not because the fact as I've indicated the security branch won't disclose their activities because I wasn't attached to the security branch.  They were not directly reporting to me, I was not directly reporting to them as such.</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> But surely if they needed your co-operation you've said, in respect of logistics and vehicles, they would have to speak to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> Moreover, the security branch, Chairperson, had their own in actual fact, logistics etc., of which maybe they have fulltime for their operations because they could not at all times come to me and maybe request such logistics.  But my members maybe and the public or the police, maybe could maybe for their shortcomings could have come to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> But you are now departing from your evidence that it, of course the police would speak to you, security branch would speak to you, and assist with logistics such as giving them vehicles and so on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> That is true yes we have such a shortage, Chairperson, I agree with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> So they would have spoken to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> Totally, - not in this incidence Chairperson, I did not - nobody ever came and informed me about this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Are you suggesting that at some stage 40 to 45 people were arrested and detained at your police station without you becoming aware of that fact?</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> Even more than that were detained in my cells of which I visited each and every morning during the afternoon and during evening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> I beg your pardon.?</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> I say, even more than that were detained, happened to be detained at Botshabelo Police Station.</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Now, Mr Tsomela, you must have warned about these proceedings and that you're being implicated in the, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> No, Sir, I have not been warned as I've said and I never took part, as I've said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> You don't understand, I said you must have been warned about these proceedings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> Will you please come again Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> I'm saying that you must have been warned about these proceedings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> No, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> How did you come here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> This present residence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> Yes I've been warned that I must appear here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And you were warned last year?  That would be 1996 possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> '80, no, no, '97 that's last year Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Okay.  Now in all the time you had the opportunity to verify from pocket books and from records books at Botshabelo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> To verify what Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> You see, you are here telling us that you don't recall this incident, and I'm saying that one would then have expected that you would go to the police station and try and see if you could see such an incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> Ja, that is true Sir, I didn't do that but the fact is that no date was given to me as to which particular day, the fact was that it was in 1986 and as a result of that I could not, you know, maybe recall and go to a specific date and look for this particular issue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> But are you sure that you would have been able to locate an entry that would be most, that would resemble the evidence given here, most than the rest.</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> As far whom is concerned, Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> What I'm putting to you is that many people were arrested at Botshabelo.  The numbers varied, the incidents varied and in one way or another you would have been able to see entries which would likely resemble the incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> As I'm saying Chairperson, I did not go to the file to verify that for the mere fact that I did not have dates etc.</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Now I'm putting it to you that you avoided looking at the occurrence books because they would confirm the incident or because you did not want to confirm the incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> Chairperson, that is not my case but the fact is that I think those pocket books or occurrence books are still available, if the Station Commissioner at present is still keeping them so I think we can collect them at any moment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Now, did you have any differences with Mr Ngo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> Which Mr Ngo?  I indicated that I don't know Mr Nelson Ngo that we was talking about here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> Now Mr Ngo has got no reason to falsely implicate you and say you were present if you were not present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> Sir, I won't know his attitude, why he has maybe thought that we have done that but the fact is that I was the Station Commissioner at Botshabelo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Or should we accept his version because you can't recall the incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> What I'm saying that I don't know Mr Ngo, Sir, and I never participated, I never took part in maiming or torturing people myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Mr Stander, by the way did you have amongst you as your clients, complainants in respect of this particular incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Unfortunately not, Mr Commissioner.</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Commissioner, were you given handwritten statement by Mr Ngo, was it shown to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> The one that he has written himself, yes Sir, I did have a photocopy of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> You see the opening sentence says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a>"During 1986"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a>he gives the year 1986 and then as you have already been told, towards the end of his statement there he alleges you took part in the assault and he talks about 40 to 45  people having been detained at your station and so on.   	I would have thought that at least if he indicates the year, and also take into account your very senior position, it would not have been difficult for you to check with the records whether such an incident did take place, the detention of 40 to 45 people at your own police station.</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> I agree with your point Sir, but as I have indicated, that you know as I thought that during the whole process of the investigation that might have been done.</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> You yourself, didn't it sufficiently trouble you, seeing that you were being implicated, to take the initiative yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> Well I didn't do that Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Well shouldn't you, I mean the Deputy Commissioner?</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> As I'm saying Sir, the records are available, they can be collected from the Station Commissioner.</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> What kind of book will show it, will it likely be the occurrence book or what?  I mean if 40, let's say this thing happened, 40 to 45 people are arrested in the township, brought into your police station, they are put together in the yard there and - let's forget the question of assault, would that incident be recorded?</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> The incident would be recorded for those people who are being detained in the cells.  They will go through the necessary ...[indistinct], maybe there ...[indistinct], and the occurrence book as such at the register of property of the detainees.</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Oh, yes, there is a suggestion that they were locked up so that they can - well there is a suggestion that they were locked up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> Then I assume that they should have been brought through necessary registers for detainees.</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">JUGDE NGOEPE:</span> And will this OB still be there at Botshabelo or elsewhere or in Pretoria or in Bloemfontein?</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> No, no, no.  I am talking under correction, the fact is that in terms of the - how do you call it, the stored instructions, I think they must still be there, being kept and held at the Police Station by the current Station Commissioner.</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Now, Commissioner, you know Coetzee of Security Branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> I think I might know him but you know there were many Coetzee's here.  I happen to know Coetzee but at the present moment I know which Coetzee you are talking about, as I'm saying there were a lot of Coetzee's who has gone through the security branch in Bloemfontein.</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Now, I'm told that that is the Coetzee who'd make arrangements proceeding the raid with you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> I don't know what Coetzee is that and the fact is that I could not under ...[indistinct] undertake an instruction from Coetzee as such. I was not working directly under him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> You see, it was not instructions as such but you are the person who had to provide personnel such as the riot squad and people who would assist security branch in the arrest.</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> As I have said Sir, no such an arrangement was made with me but there were people on the ground responsible and commanders of the different units who were on the ground maybe to execute such raids.</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Are you saying that people under you at your police station would make arrangements regarding placing personnel at the disposal of policemen from another unit without your knowledge?</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> As I have indicated, Sir, the fact is that for the sake of confidentiality, they should at times you know, arrange and go and do the necessary duty that they've seen.  They should ...[indistinct] further you know, making it loud making it known to each and every individual.</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And you were person who is central, as a head of the police station, they could speak to you and you only.</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> The fact is that I say a sensitive issue could maybe be brought to my attention but any process of a normal investigation, that would not be so necessary that they should come to me and tell me about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was there a riot unit at Botshabelo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> Come again, Chairperson?</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, sorry, I withdraw that.  Did you have special constables at Botshabelo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> I employed them, attested them in 1987 Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In 1986 we're talking about now, were there special constables at Botshabelo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> If I'm still correct Sir, according to my knowledge I attested them in 1987, as I was given such an instruction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It would appear that the members of the - as I read it, it's not clear, that it would seem that the police who assisted them were special constables at Botshabelo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> That can be verified Sir but I still maintain my saying that special constables only came about in 1987.</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Commissioner, according to the statement by Mr Ngo.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a>"After the rest, they were taken to the Botshabelo Police Station and we locked them in one control yard and Warrant Officer Mbanjani then showed us those comrades who were regarded as being the leaders".</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a> Can you perhaps help me, this control yard, where was it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> Ja, it's a control yard in a sense that the detainees van, let me call it that way, the truck it's parked in there it's just big enough to take maybe, this big truck and lock it inside there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a>	That's maybe the place that I understand that they might have been taken there of which they can maybe refer as the control yard, made in such a way that you know when the detainees are to be taken to court etc., they are within and encompassed in a controlled area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> He further alleges that</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a>"They were stripped naked and they were made to run in a circle and they were hit with plastic shamboks"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> The trailers in front, are so transparent you know, that I don't understand how that can be done because it's at an open space where the members of the public do pass as well.  So I think that if that had been done, it's very outrageous because it's an open door with two building on the sides.</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a>ADV DE JAGER</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a>"And they were hit until they were tired and then they were given exercises and they were beaten on their private parts.  Some of the comrades started swelling and bleeding on their private parts and the comrades were screaming and crying"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a>I'm not sure at what time this happened but afterwards they were...  </p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a>"And when all the comrades were weak and could almost do nothing we spray with water and left them there so that they can be locked up after they have recovered from all the beating"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a> Now if they've been locked up there - you said you inspected the people, the cells and so on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> Yes every morning me today and before I knock off duty I must go through the cells and see to the wellbeing of the detainees.</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And is a record kept of this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> An occurrence book entry is made.</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Of inspection of cells, no complaints that sort of thing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> Exactly Sir, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So that would be in the occurrence book?</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> That's right Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Have you seen people bleeding or their private parts swollen and heavily beaten up by plastic shamboks?</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> Totally not Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you have - sorry I'll go back to this now, do you have a riot unit or a riot squad at Botshabelo, Did you have?</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> The actual public order policing were situated in Bloemfontein but they travelled around wherever ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But they were not part of the Botshabelo Police Station?</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> Ja, they came sporadically, maybe time and again, whenever unrest emanated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Because it appears from Mr Ngo's application that Colonel Stevenson was there in charge of the operation, did you know a Colonel Stevenson?</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> I know Stevenson very well and if I'm not amazed, he was stationed at Bethlehem at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Bethlehem?</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> Bethlehem.</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Mr Tsomela, I'm told that no policeman from one area can go to another area and arrest people without speaking to the station commander of that area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> Like which people Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Well the people who normally arrest people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> Okay, I think what we are dealing here with, it's Botshabelo situated within the District Commissioner of Bloemfontein and we had a unit branch of the security branch situated at Botshabelo and members of the public order policing are responsible under the District Commissioner, to curb all riots within the District Commissioner's area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Well what I was putting to you is that I am told that there's no policemen from one area can go into another area and arrest people without speaking to the local Station Commander.</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> That's what I'm asking Sir.  Which policemen of a different area did come in?  From which area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Do you want to answer the question, do you want to confirm that no policemen from area can go into another area without speaking to the local Station Commander?</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, Visser on record, may I come in here.  I have the same difficulty the witness has.  First of all my learned friend does not inform you or anybody else where he gets his information from and more importantly, Mr Chairman, and this is what is leading to confusion and I don't want to put words in the mouth of the witness, but he's got to distinguish, is he talking about security branch members?  Is he talking about riot squad members?  What's he talking about?  That's what's confusing us all, Mr Chairman.  If he could be a little bit more specific I'm sure the witness can be very helpful in this regard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Also I don't know if it's relevant but the impression I got from the witnesses, does Botshabelo fall into the same district as Bloemfontein?</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> Under the same district commission of Bloemfontein by those days, Sir and even at the present moment falling then, now, under the area commission of Bloemfontein still.</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Now, would you like to answer the question which I put to you, that no policemen from one area can go into another area without speaking to the local Station Commander?</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well you've been asked to explain what you mean from one area, policemen from one area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Mr Chairman, to save time I'll go directly to the next question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a>	Mr Tsomela, my instruction are that policemen from Bloemfontein would not have gone to Botshabelo and arrested people without speaking to the Station Commander at Botshabelo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> Chairperson as I have indicated, during unrest the Station Commissioner informed the District Commissioner and as a result of that people are placed on the ground and if we are talking about that there were riots as I'm saying there were, they could place - policemen are place enough so that they can curb riots.  And the commanders in charge as I've said at the beginning do co-operate and work together and  that is the responsibility of the District Commissioner because they are within his area of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Look, I'm still saying to you and I'm repeating the question and you are not answering the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> I'm sorry Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> I'm told that policemen from Bloemfontein could not have gone to Botshabelo to arrest people at Botshabelo without speaking to the local Station Commander.</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> Chief, I might say in the beginning they will come to me but knowing that they are in Botshabelo, the South African Police Act give them the authority to arrest whoever the traitor is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> So at least you concede they will come to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> They will come to me Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Now, I am also told that you in fact as a Station Commander at Botshabelo, actually lodged complaints with the security branch or should I say rather, you reported to Security branch that you were having problems with unrest in your area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> First of all what I should say Chairperson, is that the security branch are the actual people who gave us information and they are on the ground, they are people who come in contact with such information plannings and everything etc.</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Would you not as a station commander have reported to security branch that you're having problems with unrest in your area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> Ja, I will, I will if I encounter problems I will report to my District Commissioner, but as I'm saying the security branch are the fist people and they are still, people who come in contact with the planning of such incidents as such.</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> So you did report to security branch that you having problems with unrest in your area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did he say that?  I thought he said I would report to my District Commissioner.</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> Correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Yes, and so ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That doesn't mean the security branch.  He did'nt say he had reported to the security branch, did he?  Mr Memani, you must listen to the witnesses answers and not then say he said something he has not.  Did you say you would report to the security branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> No Sir, to my District Commissioner.</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Now, I was also told that as a Station Commander, you are the person who was to authorise operations by staff who fall under your police station.</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> At my station Sir, I make up Commanders who are assigned to do each and every particular aspect and as a result of that we had what we called a Crime Prevention Unit, of which I usually put a person in charge of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a>	So I mean I've got a lot of different components like investigators etc., etc., motor car accident operators etc.  So as a result of that I've got commanders who might be operating at that level.</p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> But not at the level of conducting a large scale raid.</p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Will you please take your hand off your mouth Mr Memani so that we can hear you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> But not at the level of conducting a large scale raid?</p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> Well I don't know what you mean by a large scale raid because as I'm saying, our normal investigative duties are being done through that process that I have already explained.</p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is the relevance of this?  It does not tie in with Mr Ngo's application, does it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> It does Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Ngo's application says that</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a>"That in 1986, members of the sub-unit of the security branch stationed at Botshabelo"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a>and he names the four of them.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a>"reported to Colonel Coetzee at Fountain Street"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a>He goes on to say what they reported. </p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a>"and having received the report, the two commanding officers, Colonel Coetzee and Colonel Stevenson, ordered all the members of security branch to report on duty at 3 o'clock in the morning in Fountain Building.  On our arrival, Colonel Stevenson and Colonel Coetzee briefed the members that they were going to arrest comrades at Botshabelo and they would be assisted by members of the riot unit and the Special Constables at Botshabelo".</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a>  That is Ngo's version.</p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> He proceeds later and says that Tsomela was present and Tsomela says he knows nothing about this and what I'm establishing is that he must have known about this thing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well Ngo's version is that there was a complaint made to the security branch and they said let's go and raid.  And the complaint was made by, and he specifically says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a>"The sub-unit of the security branch stationed at Botshabelo Police Station"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a>and names the three people, the unit commander, the assistant commander.</p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> What I'm dealing with Mr Chairman is his denial that he knows about this incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He's denied it.  You made you point.  You go on and on and on and you are not putting your client's version.</p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Well, Mr Chairman, I'm not a policeman and all the things that I'm putting come from my plans or...</p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, I'm looking at his application before us to what he says happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> But with due respect, Chairperson, if someone denies something, I am entitled to cross-examine him by saying that circumstances were such that he should have known about this incident.  Now he's saying he doesn't know anything about it and I'm saying you were the station commander.</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The sound has gone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a>PROBLEMS WITH AUDIO EQUIPMENT</p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And I'm saying that you are the Station</p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a>Commander, you should have known about these things. </p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a>	May I proceed Chairperson?   Do you still want me to address you or do you want me to ask questions now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I want to know the purpose of the questions.  Are you putting the version that your client put in the application or are you putting a different version?</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> I'm not putting what is contained in the application, I'm putting questions to deal with the denial.  I'm attempting to show that the denial cannot be true because he was the Station Commander and in all likelihood he would have known about this thing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, may I please be allowed to say one thing.  The evidence of this witness has never been that he denied that the incident took place.  His evidence is that he cannot identify in his mind, in his remembrance, that particular incident, that's his evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But the point that Mr Mamome is making is that it's not just that he would have heard of it but that they would have had to ask his permission before they carried out the operation, so it's not a question of saying: "Look it may of happened, I was not there I don't know".</p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a>	Mr Memani's point which he has made, he has put to the witness is: "If outsiders come into your area they should notify you and get your permission therefore you should remember.  That's you point isn't it, Mr Memani?</p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> That's correct Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And it's been suggested that if the occurrence book shows that 45 people were detained at 4 o'clock in the morning and were in the cells the next morning, it's a little surprising that the station commander doesn't remember it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No the only point was that I understood Mr</p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a>Memani to say that he's denying that the incident took place and I was just putting that straight.</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Now I'm told that the people who were arrested were then taken not to Fountains but to Grootvlei, do you recall that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> No Sir.  As I'm saying Sir, I was not dealing with the investigation as such and the arrestees, that was not my responsibility to arrange the place of retainment as such but the investigator, according to his crime intelligence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> You see I'll tell you the impression that I've got and why I'm putting this to you.  The impression that I got is that in instances with security branch as security branch alone were interested in matters, they arrested people and they took them to Fountains and from there they would take them to prison. 	And on this occasion people were taken from Botshabelo Township into your offices, they were not taken into your cells and they were interrogated there and then taken to Grootvlei.</p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That's a prison, is it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Grootvlei is a prison, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So there would be records of their admission at Grootvlei, of the injuries they suffered?</p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> If that was permitted, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> They were taken when to Grootvlei, the same day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> It is not clear from the instructions Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a>	Don't you remember that incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> Well I was not involved in that proceeding Sir and I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> But surely the detention of people at about 4 and an interrogation of people and later conveyance to Grootvlei would have taken quite some time, long enough for you to have come on duty at about 7 or 7.30?</p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> There's no evidence to that effect, is there?  Because the evidence was simply they were sprayed with water and locked up to recover from their injuries, it doesn't say how long.</p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> As the chair pleases, I'll leave the matter there.  Those are the questions, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MEMANI</p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Brink?</p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> No thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Any re-examination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a><span class="speaker">RE-EXAMINATION BY MR VISSER:</span> Just one issue, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a>	Commissioner, the sub-unit of the security branch about which you spoke just a little earlier, can you remember who those people were in 1986, if you can't please say so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> Ja, the man in charge was the Warrant Officer Paul van der Berg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Second in charge, can you remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> Warrant Officer Mbanjani came sporadically but he was not actually permanent as far as my understanding but - well I don't know their entire internal arrangements, but he used to come to Botshabelo to assist Warrant Officer van der Berg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> There is reference here to Sergeant Smith in the application of Mr Ngo, can you tell us something about Sergeant Smith?</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> Sergeant Smith was for a very short while in Botshabelo.  I think he passed away in a car accident within a week or two after his landing in Botshabelo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, so he could have been there only for a about a week or two.</p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> That's right yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Is it at all possible to find a record somewhere where one could establish the date of Mr Smith, the late Mr Smith, Sergeant Smith's death?  If you could perhaps help us with an indication or a suggestion from your side?</p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> Yes I think from the head of the security branch from Bloemfontein he might still have his file, I hope.</p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Lastly, was Constable Lesale, is that a person that you know personally, Lesale - L-e-s-a-l-e?  Was he a member of that sub-unit of the security branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> I won't deny that Chairperson, but I just cannot recall him you know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You can't recall him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was this a separate unit responsible to Bloemfontein, who merely were stationed at your police station?</p>
<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> It was a sub-branch emanating from the main branch in Bloemfontein Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And were they told what they should do by Bloemfontein.</p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> That is quite true they were reporting to Bloemfontein main head office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> They weren't reporting to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> No Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Perhaps I should just place this on record lastly Commissioner.  You don't deny that the incident took place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> That is true Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> It's just that you say that you can't particularly remember this particular incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> That is true Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think you go further than that don't you, you say you did not participate in this incident in any way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> That is true Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line546"><a name="pos546"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> We'll leave it for argument Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You're not going to suggest that a Station Commander would not recollect people being beaten while naked in his police station at 4 in the morning and that he participated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line548"><a name="pos548"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No, I'm suggesting precisely the opposite Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR VISSER</p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a><span class="speaker">FURTHER CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MEMANI:</span> Mr Chairman may I ask something which I forgot to put to the witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a>	Mr Tsomela do you remember a Sergeant Coetzee who worked at your police station?</p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> Coetzee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> I was told Kotze.</p>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> Kotze?  A Sergeant Kotze?</p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> Yes there was a Kotze at - of which I know, who was attached to the security branch at Botshabelo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And he used to drive a Datsun 4x4 Van or Bakkie?</p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a><span class="speaker">MR TSOMELA:</span> Ja, ja maybe, but we had a lot of 4x4's in Botshabelo because of the unpassable area naturally in Botshabelo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> I'm indebted to the chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MEMANI</p>
<p class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Mr Memani, I would like you to - not at this</p>

<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> As the Chair pleases.</p>

<p class="line" id="line568"><a name="pos568"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> That is correct Chairperson, except that you know, at this stage it seems that it would be more appropriate for Mr Visser to give the references because he is leading in chief.</p>
<p class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> I'm only saying that there was a 14TH paragraph, annexure annexed, and the pre-trial conference refers to those - oh, it's 2.14 thank you.</p>

<p class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Mr Chairman just before we proceed, I have been given instructions that some of my clients know some of the persons who were arrested there and assaulted at Botshabelo Police Station on this specific occasion on which we are hearing evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a>	It is also my instruction that during the following - this coming weekend we will attempt to get hold of those people and if they become available it will in order to assist the police - the Commissioner, to offer this evidence.  This is being done as a result of a question from Judge Ngoepe, whether any of the persons have consulted me.  That is merely just information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Their names appear on the application some of them.  They have been available for years, why do they suddenly think they're going to appear at this stage?  If you look at page 35 of the application, he says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a>"Some of the comrades I can still remember who were beaten by me and the members of the security branch in the process of their arrest are Jaluka, Mokoke, Makushang Kutabong, Molashawani Molakani.</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Mr Chairman, to assist Mr Stander, the problem doesn't lie with Mr Stander but to the fact that the Investigative Unit did not chase these people up and did not did not give them notices. That is why they were not before - the people who came before you or became Mr Stander's clients, were mostly people the TRC had brought to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> I also want to add, I do not waste the commission's time, I just want to inform the commission that the possibility exists to assist the commission. If such persons come forward it will happen during the course of next week.  If the commission tells me that I do not have to do anything further in this connection, I will leave it as such.</p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, if you wish to notify them, or somebody wishes to notify them, I'm not saying he shouldn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> And I should say that when I asked that question, I was not suggesting that we should open these proceedings in such a way that they should look like it's just a free for all situation.  These are formal proceedings and people should come in at the right time if they want to testify and I did not suggest that proceedings should be just opened up and be allowed to get out of hand like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> I have understanding for the situation, I will leave the matter there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, to save time, can the witness go to the witness stand so long, the next witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Sesedinyane please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line585"><a name="pos585"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Perhaps there should be some enquiry made Mr Stander, because I have drawn your attention to the fact Mr Ngo names at page 35 of his application, names four of the victims.  The victim Maloshono Malakane was interviewed by, on behalf of the TRC apparently and she informed the interviewer that she had never been tortured or detained at the Botshabelo Police Station in 1986 and she knows where the other people are.  So if anybody wants to, they can enquire from her.  She's told where the other people have moved to, she has a telephone number.</p>
<p class="line" id="line586"><a name="pos586"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> I undertake to - if possible, to get in touch with these specific persons and I will inform the commission on Monday what has been done about that.</p>

<p class="line" id="line589"><a name="pos589"></a>	Mr Sesedinyane, is it correct that your name is spelt S-e-s-e-d-i-n-y-a-n-e?  </p>

<p class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> It's P41, Exhibit P41 Mr Chairman, I was just going to refer you to that but I will spell it again - S-e-s-e-d-i-n-y-a-n-e, and his christian names are B-u-t-i-n-y-a-n-e Simon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a>	Now, Mr Sesedinyane, you have a problem with your interpretation?  Mr Sesedinyane, are you a member of the South African Police Service?</p>
<p class="line" id="line593"><a name="pos593"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESEDINYANE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line594"><a name="pos594"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Since, or rather when did you join the South African Police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESEDINYANE:</span> From 1973 Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line596"><a name="pos596"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And is it correct that you also became a member of the security branch here at Bloemfontein.</p>
<p class="line" id="line597"><a name="pos597"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESEDINYANE:</span> That is correct.</p>

<p class="line" id="line601"><a name="pos601"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> 13, page 13 of Exhibit B.</p>
<p class="line" id="line602"><a name="pos602"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, I was just going to look for the page.</p>
<p class="line" id="line603"><a name="pos603"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, it's not page 13.</p>
<p class="line" id="line604"><a name="pos604"></a><span class="speaker">MRS VISSER:</span> No, it's not page 13.</p>
<p class="line" id="line605"><a name="pos605"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> It says 13 on the index.</p>
<p class="line" id="line606"><a name="pos606"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> If it's the affidavit, it's a page 108 I think.</p>
<p class="line" id="line607"><a name="pos607"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Indeed, it's page 108 of bundle B Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line608"><a name="pos608"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Is it correct that you became aware that certain allegations of illegal activity were made against you Mr Sesedinyane?</p>
<p class="line" id="line609"><a name="pos609"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESEDINYANE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line610"><a name="pos610"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And did you thereupon make an affidavit with Attorney Wagner?</p>
<p class="line" id="line611"><a name="pos611"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESEDINYANE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line612"><a name="pos612"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Is that the document now being shown to you and was that signed by you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line613"><a name="pos613"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESEDINYANE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line614"><a name="pos614"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And did you make that affidavit out of your own free will without anybody cohersing you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line615"><a name="pos615"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESEDINYANE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line616"><a name="pos616"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Do you confirm the contents of that affidavit as being true and correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line617"><a name="pos617"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESEDINYANE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line618"><a name="pos618"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> In paragraph 2.3 you refer to an annexure B of an applicant.  Just by way of explanation, that is an annexure which refers - that refers to an annexure to Mr Motsamai's application, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line619"><a name="pos619"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESEDINYANE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line620"><a name="pos620"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, why I'm making this point is you will recall, there is an Annexure A and the same document became an Annexure B and then there were cross-references, Annexures A and B, but they were the same document.  Perhaps it will be less confusing if you bore that in mind.</p>
<p class="line" id="line621"><a name="pos621"></a>	But apart from the allegations contained in paragraph 12 to which we'll come in a moment, by Mr Motsamai, is it not true that you were implicated by a Mr Ngo in his application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line622"><a name="pos622"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESEDINYANE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line623"><a name="pos623"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And that concerned the item of the, what we refer to as the Botshabelo incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line624"><a name="pos624"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESEDINYANE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line625"><a name="pos625"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where is this, where is the reference?</p>
<p class="line" id="line626"><a name="pos626"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Page 31 of bundle A Mr Chairman, page 31.   We must just place on record Mr Chairman, that it's not altogether clear that this is the particular person that is implicated.  If you look at the handwritten document at the foot of page 35.</p>
<p class="line" id="line627"><a name="pos627"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, he names a Samuel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line628"><a name="pos628"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, the second last name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line629"><a name="pos629"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That is the only reference to a name isn't it, at page 35?</p>
<p class="line" id="line630"><a name="pos630"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> We're departing from the point of view that he may implicated and that's why he is presenting himself to you as a witness, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line631"><a name="pos631"></a>	During 1985 and '86, what were your duties as a policeman?  Where were you stationed with what unit were you working and what were your duties?</p>
<p class="line" id="line632"><a name="pos632"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESEDINYANE:</span> I joined the police in 1973.  I was stationed at Park Road uniform branch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line633"><a name="pos633"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And in 1985?</p>
<p class="line" id="line634"><a name="pos634"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESEDINYANE:</span> In 1985 I was in the uniform branch and in 1986 or 1985, I was working at special duty in East London.</p>

<p class="line" id="line636"><a name="pos636"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESEDINYANE:</span> And in 1986 on the 7th month on the 24th, I started at the security branch in Bloemfontein.</p>
<p class="line" id="line637"><a name="pos637"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> At what date?</p>
<p class="line" id="line638"><a name="pos638"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESEDINYANE:</span> On the 24th of July 1986, on the 24th of July.</p>

<p class="line" id="line640"><a name="pos640"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESEDINYANE:</span> I was in East London and when I left I went straight to the security branch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line641"><a name="pos641"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Mr Chairman, before Mr Visser proceeds, we have just been instructed that the person implicated, Samuel Sinyane was a special constable at Botshabelo and is not a member of the security branch and therefore Mr Sesedinyane can go and have a rest.</p>
<p class="line" id="line642"><a name="pos642"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Person implicated by who?</p>
<p class="line" id="line643"><a name="pos643"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> By Ngo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line644"><a name="pos644"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But what about Motsamai?</p>
<p class="line" id="line645"><a name="pos645"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> As the chair pleases.  Yes I remember now he's implicated in the forming of the church.</p>
<p class="line" id="line646"><a name="pos646"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line647"><a name="pos647"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Yes, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line648"><a name="pos648"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  You don't say that that was not him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line649"><a name="pos649"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line650"><a name="pos650"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But you say that the Ngo one, that although he is referred to there as constable it was a special constable?</p>
<p class="line" id="line651"><a name="pos651"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Yes.  Mr Visser may proceed Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line652"><a name="pos652"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Alright, well then lets confine ourselves to paragraph 12 page 148 of bundle A, Mr Chairman.  Here, Mr Motsamai in his application said that he, Mamome, Sergeant Sesesidayne, that's you, and Constable Morakile petrol bombed a parish house in Botshabelo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line653"><a name="pos653"></a>	He says he cannot recall the name of that parish or the church, he says the priest who was staying in that house had been involved in political activities.  "Sesedinyane can furnish further information regarding that incident"</p>
<p class="line" id="line654"><a name="pos654"></a>So what Mr Motsamai says is you were part of the group of people who petrol bombed the parish or the church and you can give up yourself - can give further information.  Can you comment on what I've just read to you?  What do you say about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line655"><a name="pos655"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESEDINYANE:</span> The issue that I took part in that group which petrol bombed the church or the parish, it's a lie.  I dispute the whole issue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line656"><a name="pos656"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Just tell us, do you know whether a parish house in Botshabelo had indeed been attacked with petrol bombs at some stage or other?</p>
<p class="line" id="line657"><a name="pos657"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESEDINYANE:</span> I did not hear anything in that regard.  I started to know that after receiving the summons, to know that something like that happened in Botshabelo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line658"><a name="pos658"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, now what church - do you go to church Mr Sesedinyane?</p>
<p class="line" id="line659"><a name="pos659"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESEDINYANE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line660"><a name="pos660"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And what denomination do you follow?</p>
<p class="line" id="line661"><a name="pos661"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESEDINYANE:</span> Roman Catholic Church Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line662"><a name="pos662"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And what about your family, them as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line663"><a name="pos663"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESEDINYANE:</span> The whole family, that's the father, the mother the whole family and myself, and my whole family, they attend the Roman Catholic Church and I attended school at Roman Catholic Church.</p>
<p class="line" id="line664"><a name="pos664"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Do you attend church in Botshabelo or in another place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line665"><a name="pos665"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESEDINYANE:</span> In Bloemfontein.</p>
<p class="line" id="line666"><a name="pos666"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Now you've said it's a lie, do you mean by that that you deny that you took part in any attack on a church or a parish?</p>
<p class="line" id="line667"><a name="pos667"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESEDINYANE:</span> That is correct, it's a lie, I didn't take part in the attack of that church and I did not have a reason to attack even the same church, the Roman Catholic Church or any other church.</p>
<p class="line" id="line668"><a name="pos668"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Do you know of or were you aware at the time of a priest that had been involved in political activities that you can remember about today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line669"><a name="pos669"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESEDINYANE:</span> You mean in Botshabelo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line670"><a name="pos670"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line671"><a name="pos671"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESEDINYANE:</span> I did not have a knowledge that there was a priest or minister who was involved in political activities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line672"><a name="pos672"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Your particular job at the security branch in Bloemfontein, would it be correct to say that from the middle of 1986 - July I think when you told us, you worked in a particular section on the security branch, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line673"><a name="pos673"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESEDINYANE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line674"><a name="pos674"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And what section was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line675"><a name="pos675"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESEDINYANE:</span> It was called swart seksie/black section.</p>
<p class="line" id="line676"><a name="pos676"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Black section.  Who worked with you in that section?</p>
<p class="line" id="line677"><a name="pos677"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESEDINYANE:</span> Sergeant Mamome, myself, Motsamai, Mtyhala, I don't remember others.</p>
<p class="line" id="line678"><a name="pos678"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> The point is this, was Mr Ngo part of that section at any time that you know about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line679"><a name="pos679"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESEDINYANE:</span> I don't know Ngo, I've never worked with Ngo, I've only read about him in the newspaper called Volksblad, about his incidents.  I don't know him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line680"><a name="pos680"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Isn't it a fact that when you came to the security branch in 1986, Mr Ngo wasn't in Bloemfontein any longer, so you don't know him?   You never worked with him and you don't know him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line681"><a name="pos681"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESEDINYANE:</span> I don't know him, I haven't worked with him.  When I arrived I didn't find him at the security branch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line682"><a name="pos682"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Those are the questions, thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line683"><a name="pos683"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR VISSER</p>
<p class="line" id="line684"><a name="pos684"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> i have no questions Mr Chairman, Mr Visser has taken over my questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line685"><a name="pos685"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR DU PLESSIS</p>

<p class="line" id="line690"><a name="pos690"></a>when did you join Bloemfontein security branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line691"><a name="pos691"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESEDINYANE:</span> On the 7th month, on the 24th 1986.</p>
<p class="line" id="line692"><a name="pos692"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> This was in July?</p>
<p class="line" id="line693"><a name="pos693"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...[inaudible]</p>
<p class="line" id="line694"><a name="pos694"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> I was listening to the Sotho Chairperson,it required some thinking about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line695"><a name="pos695"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He gave that evidence in chief.</p>
<p class="line" id="line696"><a name="pos696"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> As the chair pleases.</p>
<p class="line" id="line697"><a name="pos697"></a>	Now, before then, where were you working?</p>
<p class="line" id="line698"><a name="pos698"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESEDINYANE:</span> I was working at uniform branch in Park Road.</p>
<p class="line" id="line699"><a name="pos699"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And where did you live?</p>
<p class="line" id="line700"><a name="pos700"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESEDINYANE:</span> In Bloemfontein.</p>
<p class="line" id="line701"><a name="pos701"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Where in Bloemfontein?</p>
<p class="line" id="line702"><a name="pos702"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESEDINYANE:</span> Blumanda.</p>
<p class="line" id="line703"><a name="pos703"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Is that far from Botshabelo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line704"><a name="pos704"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESEDINYANE:</span> Blumanda is right inside Bloemfontein, it's in Addisburg Road.</p>
<p class="line" id="line705"><a name="pos705"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> I meant Botshabelo, I'm sorry, the township here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line706"><a name="pos706"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESEDINYANE:</span> I don't understand what he's saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line707"><a name="pos707"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Is the area where you live very far from Botshabelo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line708"><a name="pos708"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESEDINYANE:</span> Blumanda and Botshabelo are not one and the same thing, Blumanda is Blumanda, Botshabelo is Botshabelo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line709"><a name="pos709"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> But the question I am asking, is it far from that place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line710"><a name="pos710"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESEDINYANE:</span> I'm not able to tell the difference.  After two blocks is Palming and Rocklands, then after that you get Blumanda.  I would say it might be - the distance between the two, it will be 15 kilometres.</p>
<p class="line" id="line711"><a name="pos711"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Did you not at any stage get to hear about an informer who had been exposed by students and injured?</p>
<p class="line" id="line712"><a name="pos712"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESEDINYANE:</span> No, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line713"><a name="pos713"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Now did you not ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line714"><a name="pos714"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I'm totally confused, you told us you joined the special branch in Bloemfontein on the 24th July 1986, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line715"><a name="pos715"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESEDINYANE:</span> That is 1986, on the 7th month, on the 24th I joined the security branch in Bloemfontein.</p>
<p class="line" id="line716"><a name="pos716"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, now I understood you to say when you were giving your evidence in chief, that you came from Bloemfontein to East London.  Did I misunderstand you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line717"><a name="pos717"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESEDINYANE:</span> I don't understand your question Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line718"><a name="pos718"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You were stationed in East London at some stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line719"><a name="pos719"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESEDINYANE:</span> I went to East London for a three month special duty, then when I returned I joined the security police in Bloemfontein.</p>
<p class="line" id="line720"><a name="pos720"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you were in East London?</p>
<p class="line" id="line721"><a name="pos721"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESEDINYANE:</span> Because it's three months I'm not able to put it into perspective.</p>
<p class="line" id="line722"><a name="pos722"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, was it immediately before you joined the security police?  Would that have then been May, June and July of 1986?</p>
<p class="line" id="line723"><a name="pos723"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESEDINYANE:</span> Let me explain.  I was stationed at Park Road, I left Park Road and then I went for three months special duty in East London.  When I returned from East London I joined the - I went directly to join the security police on the 24th July 1986.</p>
<p class="line" id="line724"><a name="pos724"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Now, Mr Sesedinyane, did you know Erasmus?</p>
<p class="line" id="line725"><a name="pos725"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESEDINYANE:</span> I know him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line726"><a name="pos726"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And was he there when you arrived at security branch in 1986?</p>
<p class="line" id="line727"><a name="pos727"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESEDINYANE:</span> I'll not say he was there or he was not there, people come and leave.  I'll not say as to whether he was there or not but I know him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line728"><a name="pos728"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Don't you recall that he was already a member of Bloemfontein at that stage and actually stationed at Fountains?</p>
<p class="line" id="line729"><a name="pos729"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESEDINYANE:</span> As I explained that the people would arrive and are those who leave.  I'll not say I came with him or he came before me or after me, but I know him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line730"><a name="pos730"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Are you trying to suggest that you are not aware of the presence of a senior policeman who was there when you joined this station and has never left that station according to what we've heard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line731"><a name="pos731"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESEDINYANE:</span> If you are not working with a person directly you will not say he is there or is not there.  I know Mr Erasmus, but I was not working with him directly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line732"><a name="pos732"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And Shaw?</p>
<p class="line" id="line733"><a name="pos733"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESEDINYANE:</span> I know him, I worked with him directly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line734"><a name="pos734"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And he was there when you joined Fountains?</p>
<p class="line" id="line735"><a name="pos735"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESEDINYANE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line736"><a name="pos736"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And Coetzee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line737"><a name="pos737"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> He has said that he doesn't remember, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line738"><a name="pos738"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> That's not in the evidence, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line739"><a name="pos739"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Has he been asked about Coetzee before?</p>
<p class="line" id="line740"><a name="pos740"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Oh, I'm sorry, Coetzee ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line741"><a name="pos741"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Will you please not interrupt Mr Visser.</p>
<p class="line" id="line742"><a name="pos742"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, I beg your pardon, I made a mistake.</p>
<p class="line" id="line743"><a name="pos743"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And Mr Coetzee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line744"><a name="pos744"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESEDINYANE:</span> He was there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line745"><a name="pos745"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Now, do you recall whether Motsamai was there in 1986 when you joined?</p>
<p class="line" id="line746"><a name="pos746"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr who?</p>
<p class="line" id="line747"><a name="pos747"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Motsamai.</p>
<p class="line" id="line748"><a name="pos748"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...[inaudible]</p>
<p class="line" id="line749"><a name="pos749"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> I've asked him about ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line750"><a name="pos750"></a>	And Motsamai, was he there when you joined?</p>
<p class="line" id="line751"><a name="pos751"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESEDINYANE:</span> He was present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line752"><a name="pos752"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Did you also work with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line753"><a name="pos753"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line754"><a name="pos754"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And Mamome used to work with Motsamai?</p>
<p class="line" id="line755"><a name="pos755"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESEDINYANE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line756"><a name="pos756"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> So these are all people that you worked with closely?</p>
<p class="line" id="line757"><a name="pos757"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESEDINYANE:</span> Yes I nearly forget one, that's Mr Ramosoeu, I just remembered his name.  Those people I've mentioned they compromised our section.</p>
<p class="line" id="line758"><a name="pos758"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And your team was a good team, the relations between members of the team were good?</p>
<p class="line" id="line759"><a name="pos759"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESEDINYANE:</span> I don't know if we had a good relationship.  What did you mean, there would be conflicts if people are working together?</p>
<p class="line" id="line760"><a name="pos760"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Well, were you not on good terms with any member of the team?</p>
<p class="line" id="line761"><a name="pos761"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESEDINYANE:</span> In Sesotho, when you say you are not in good terms with a person, it does not necessarily mean that you are in conflict with that person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line762"><a name="pos762"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Were there any bad feelings between yourself and any member of the team?</p>
<p class="line" id="line763"><a name="pos763"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESEDINYANE:</span> There was no member whom I was in conflict with because of a particular behaviour, meaning myself.  I don't know of that person, I mean meaning myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line764"><a name="pos764"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Particularly you did not have - there were no bad feelings between yourself and Motsamai?</p>
<p class="line" id="line765"><a name="pos765"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESEDINYANE:</span> There was no conflict between myself and Motsamai, the conflict which was there was work related.  We didn't have bad blood with him but it was just then and there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line766"><a name="pos766"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Now, you said that Mr Motsamai told us that he was with you when a certain church was bombed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line767"><a name="pos767"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESEDINYANE:</span> I dispute that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line768"><a name="pos768"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> He told us that he went there with you and Mamome.</p>
<p class="line" id="line769"><a name="pos769"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think you should correct it, it wasn't a church that was bombed, it was a house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line770"><a name="pos770"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> A parish house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line771"><a name="pos771"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> A parish house.  I'm indebted to your lordship.  	Now a parish house was bombed by yourself, Mamome and Motsamai.</p>
<p class="line" id="line772"><a name="pos772"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESEDINYANE:</span> Sir, I've never committed such an act.</p>
<p class="line" id="line773"><a name="pos773"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Together with Morakile.</p>
<p class="line" id="line774"><a name="pos774"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESEDINYANE:</span> I refuse.</p>
<p class="line" id="line775"><a name="pos775"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> If I may take instructions, Chairperson?</p>
<p class="line" id="line776"><a name="pos776"></a>	Now you told us that you got the instructions from Shaw and Coetzee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line777"><a name="pos777"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESEDINYANE:</span> I've never said that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line778"><a name="pos778"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Or may I repeat, he told us that it was instructions from Shaw and Coetzee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line779"><a name="pos779"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESEDINYANE:</span> If those were his instructions I do not know them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line780"><a name="pos780"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Now at the time that I when Motsamai resigned from the police force was there any ill blood between yourself and Mr Motsamai, Are there any ill feelings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line781"><a name="pos781"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESEDINYANE:</span> I do not know how to answer that question because I was not working with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line782"><a name="pos782"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> When did you stop working with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line783"><a name="pos783"></a><span class="speaker">MR SESEDINYANE:</span> It's a long time Sir, I do not remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line784"><a name="pos784"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Those are my questions Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line785"><a name="pos785"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MEMANI</p>

<p class="line" id="line793"><a name="pos793"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, may I suggest that we take an adjournment.</p>

<p class="line" id="line815"><a name="pos815"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> 1984, on the 4th month, on the 21st 1981, sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line816"><a name="pos816"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> 21st of April 1981.</p>
<p class="line" id="line817"><a name="pos817"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line818"><a name="pos818"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And did you at some stage join the security branch here in Bloemfontein?</p>
<p class="line" id="line819"><a name="pos819"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line820"><a name="pos820"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Can you remember when that was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line821"><a name="pos821"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> I don't remember the day but it was in 1985 in June.</p>
<p class="line" id="line822"><a name="pos822"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> June 1985.  Now in what section did you work in the security branch in Bloemfontein?</p>
<p class="line" id="line823"><a name="pos823"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> I was working with the trade unions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line824"><a name="pos824"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And in doing that, were you working together with other members of the security branch here in Bloemfontein in that section?</p>
<p class="line" id="line825"><a name="pos825"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line826"><a name="pos826"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And who were they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line827"><a name="pos827"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> I was working with Petrus Miningwa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line828"><a name="pos828"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And that is spelt M-i-i-n-g-w-a.   Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line829"><a name="pos829"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> Our section head was Captain Hendrik Prinsloo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line830"><a name="pos830"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> In the type of work which you did in that section, did it come about that you worked with other members of the security branch or were you pretty much working on your own?</p>
<p class="line" id="line831"><a name="pos831"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> We were not meeting with other members of various sections.</p>
<p class="line" id="line832"><a name="pos832"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you ever work with Mr Nelson Ngo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line833"><a name="pos833"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> Not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line834"><a name="pos834"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And Mr Motsamai?</p>
<p class="line" id="line835"><a name="pos835"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> No Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line836"><a name="pos836"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Now Mr Ngo has alleged in his application at page 31, that in 1986 - I'm sorry that is bundle A of course Mr Chairman, that in 1986 there was a sub-unit of the security branch stationed at Botshabelo.  Do you know about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line837"><a name="pos837"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> I know of that unit but I haven't worked in that unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line838"><a name="pos838"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> So when Mr Ngo says that in 1986 - that is page 31, that you were a member of that sub-unit he's mistaken?</p>
<p class="line" id="line839"><a name="pos839"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> He's lying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line840"><a name="pos840"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Then Mr Ngo refers at page 35 to your name - that's the bottom of the page, Mr Chairman, item 8, he refers to you as being one of the persons who was involved in what he alleged to have been an assault on comrades who had been arrested in a raid in 1986.  What do you say about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line841"><a name="pos841"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> I never worked in Botshabelo, even what he's saying I don't know that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line842"><a name="pos842"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Now coming then to Mr Motsamai - as you stated in your affidavit in paragraph 2.3, he implicates you in three incidents and they are incidents 6, 10 and 14.  Now I want to refresh your memory with reference to page 147 of bundle A where he says this: he says that he, Motsamai, Mamome, Constable Lesale and Constable Miningwa petrol bombed the parental house of one Citi Mzuzwana.  Citi Mzuzwana was an organiser of the Mangong Youth Congress.  Now first of all, in 1986, what was your rank?</p>
<p class="line" id="line843"><a name="pos843"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> Constable.</p>
<p class="line" id="line844"><a name="pos844"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you know Mr Citi Mzuzwana at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line845"><a name="pos845"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> No Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line846"><a name="pos846"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did he feature at all in your investigations into the activities of trade unions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line847"><a name="pos847"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> No Sir</p>
<p class="line" id="line848"><a name="pos848"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What do you say of the allegation that you were a member of that group who petrol bombed the house of the parents of Citi Mzuzwana?</p>
<p class="line" id="line849"><a name="pos849"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> I know nothing about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line850"><a name="pos850"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Do you from your own knowledge know where that house had in fact been attacked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line851"><a name="pos851"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> I don't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line852"><a name="pos852"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Coming then to the next one which is paragraph 10, Mr Motsamai said the following: he said himself, Mamome, Constable Morakile, Constable Mtyhala, which is - well, perhaps, I'm sorry Mr Chairman, may I start again, Mamome, spelt M-a-m-o-m-e, Constable Morakile, M-o-r-a-k-i-l-e, Constable Mtyhala - this is an incorrect spelling and I'll spell it correctly, M-t-h-y-a-l-a, Constable Litseo, L-i-t-s-e-o and Constable Lesale who is yourself, petrol bombed the house of Teacher Bolosha, B-o-l-o-s-h-a who was a member of the UDF.  Was this person a person that you were giving attention to as in your work concerning the activities of trade unions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line853"><a name="pos853"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> It's not like that I don't know that person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line854"><a name="pos854"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You don't know him.  Did you participate as a member of a group who petrol bombed his house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line855"><a name="pos855"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> It's not like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line856"><a name="pos856"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Do you personally have knowledge of the fact whether his house was in fact attacked or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line857"><a name="pos857"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> No Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line858"><a name="pos858"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And then, lastly ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line859"><a name="pos859"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, it wasn't a he was it, it was a she?</p>
<p class="line" id="line860"><a name="pos860"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> One of them was a lady, it may have been ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line861"><a name="pos861"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Bolasha was a lady, she's now a teacher in Pretoria.</p>
<p class="line" id="line862"><a name="pos862"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line863"><a name="pos863"></a>	Well I don't know </p>
<p class="line" id="line864"><a name="pos864"></a>whether that makes any difference to your answer Mr Lesale, it was a lady teacher.  Did you know her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line865"><a name="pos865"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> I don't know her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line866"><a name="pos866"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And lastly, at page 148 Mr Motsamai says that himself, Mamome, Mtyhala, Lesale, Miningwa and Ramosoeu - and I haven't spelt that one yet, I'll spell it, R-a-m-o-s-o-e-u, were involved in the attempted murder of one Oupa Makubalo who was the chairperson of COSAS.</p>
<p class="line" id="line867"><a name="pos867"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> That's not correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line868"><a name="pos868"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And he says he had been implicated in the murder of one of what he calls our informers, Kosi</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line869"><a name="pos869"></a>"and we fired several shots at him but missed"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line870"><a name="pos870"></a>Do you know anything about this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line871"><a name="pos871"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> Yes I know the day when we were going to arrest Mr Oupa Makubalo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line872"><a name="pos872"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Who were the persons according to your recollection who were present on that day when you went to arrest Oupa Makubalo.  Were you present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line873"><a name="pos873"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> I was present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line874"><a name="pos874"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Was Mr Motsamai present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line875"><a name="pos875"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> He was present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line876"><a name="pos876"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Mamome, he was present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line877"><a name="pos877"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> He was present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line878"><a name="pos878"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Miningwa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line879"><a name="pos879"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> I don't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line880"><a name="pos880"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Ramosoeu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line881"><a name="pos881"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> I think he was present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line882"><a name="pos882"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And is it true that you all went with one vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line883"><a name="pos883"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> Yes it was a Kombi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line884"><a name="pos884"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And where did you go.</p>
<p class="line" id="line885"><a name="pos885"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> It was in the afternoon just about, we were just about the knock off.  We were in the kitchen,  Motsamai arrived then he told us that the person who has killed his informer, he's in Botshabelo, he has met with his other informer then he informed him that.  Then he is requesting our assistance to go and help him to arrest that person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line886"><a name="pos886"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And you then left and you went to Botshabelo, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line887"><a name="pos887"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> That is Botshabela.</p>
<p class="line" id="line888"><a name="pos888"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I'm sorry, Botshabela.  And in your own words, tell the Committee as best you can remember, exactly what happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line889"><a name="pos889"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> We were driving in the main road called Moshweshwe, Motsamai was supposed to show us the street we were supposed to take.  He showed us the street and then we saw a group of boys standing.  Just when we approached, he chased this person and then he shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line890"><a name="pos890"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Just stop there.  Please when you refer to a person, please mention his name.  Who was the one who chased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line891"><a name="pos891"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> Motsamai got out of the car and he chased Oupa, I did not know his name all the time.   Mamome got out of the car but I do not remember whether Ramosoeu and others got out of the car, Motsamai shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line892"><a name="pos892"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> He shot where, at whom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line893"><a name="pos893"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> He was shooting in Oupa's direction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line894"><a name="pos894"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What was Oupa doing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line895"><a name="pos895"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> They were standing under a tree when we arrived in the Kombi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line896"><a name="pos896"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And when he was shooting was he still standing under the tree?</p>
<p class="line" id="line897"><a name="pos897"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> When the Kombi stopped Oupa ran away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line898"><a name="pos898"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> So he was shot at while he was running away, is that what you're saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line899"><a name="pos899"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> That is correct, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line900"><a name="pos900"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Can you remember today how many shots Mr Motsamai shot at in the direction of Oupa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line901"><a name="pos901"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> I don't remember but it was several times.</p>
<p class="line" id="line902"><a name="pos902"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you fire any shots on that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line903"><a name="pos903"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line904"><a name="pos904"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you see Mamome fire any shots on that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line905"><a name="pos905"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line906"><a name="pos906"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Was Mamome running in the same direction as the direction in which Oupa Makubalo was running or was running in a different direction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line907"><a name="pos907"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> He was running in - to his direction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line908"><a name="pos908"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And Oupa Makubalo was in fact arrested that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line909"><a name="pos909"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line910"><a name="pos910"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Those are the questions in evidence in chief, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line911"><a name="pos911"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR VISSER</p>

<p class="line" id="line913"><a name="pos913"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> Yes, for about two months if not more than that, I do not remember well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line914"><a name="pos914"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Was that when Mr Ngo was still in Bloemfontein?</p>
<p class="line" id="line915"><a name="pos915"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> He arrived whilst I was still working there and I was told that he's being recruited.</p>
<p class="line" id="line916"><a name="pos916"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> Right, what I really want to know is after you had left Bloemfontein and had gone to Pretoria, did you ever speak to him then, after you had left Bloemfontein?</p>

<p class="line" id="line918"><a name="pos918"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PLESSIS:</span> And during the time you spent at the security police can you remember any instance whatsoever where</p>
<p class="line" id="line919"><a name="pos919"></a>somebody else from another security branch from somewhere else in the country, was used in an operation by the security branch in Bloemfontein?</p>

<p class="line" id="line927"><a name="pos927"></a>	You told my learned friend, Mr du Plessis, that you knew Mr Ngo when you were told that he's being recruited, do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line928"><a name="pos928"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line929"><a name="pos929"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Recruited as what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line930"><a name="pos930"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> He was a student in the police.</p>

Tell me, did you have other people who went out together with Mr Motsamai?  Did you also have firearms with yourselves.</p>
<p class="line" id="line936"><a name="pos936"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> All the policemen from the security branch had guns.  I remember on that day we also had guns but I do not remember checking as to whether all of us had guns.</p>
<p class="line" id="line937"><a name="pos937"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Did you also have a gun yourself?</p>

<p class="line" id="line941"><a name="pos941"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> For example when you went to arrest somebody.  Did you always take your guns with you.  Your weapons with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line942"><a name="pos942"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> You must carry your gun, it was regulation to have your gun when you go to arrest a person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line943"><a name="pos943"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> And on this particular day, do you know if Sergeant Mamome had his weapon with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line944"><a name="pos944"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> I said I do not remember whether others had their guns or not, I did not look at them as to whether they had their guns.</p>
<p class="line" id="line945"><a name="pos945"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Wouldn't it have been strange Sir, because you were out on a mission.  Wouldn't it have been rather strange that if Mamome didn't have his gun with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line946"><a name="pos946"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Isn't this pure argument?</p>
<p class="line" id="line947"><a name="pos947"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And may I place on record, Mr Mamome will not deny that he had his firearm with him Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line948"><a name="pos948"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> It has never been my work to inspect whether policeman had a gun in his possession, What I know is that a person must have his gun.  Whether he had his gun or not on that day I do not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line949"><a name="pos949"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Mr Lesale has been told that Mr Mamome did have his weapon with him so it's not a problem.  When Sergeant Mamome got out of the car after he got to Oupa Makubalo, did you see if he fired any shots in the direction of Makubalo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line950"><a name="pos950"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> No, I do not remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line951"><a name="pos951"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Did he not run after him also Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line952"><a name="pos952"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> He was running after him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line953"><a name="pos953"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Do I understand you correctly, you stayed in the car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line954"><a name="pos954"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> I was not inside the car, I was standing alongside the car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line955"><a name="pos955"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Why did you get out of the car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line956"><a name="pos956"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> I was left behind with the car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line957"><a name="pos957"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Did you know where they were running to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line958"><a name="pos958"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> They ran all over in that street, I do not know where they went to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line959"><a name="pos959"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Was only one shot fired or more than one shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line960"><a name="pos960"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> I do not remember how many times were shot, but the gun was firing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line961"><a name="pos961"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Whose weapon it was, can you say, who fired those shots?</p>
<p class="line" id="line962"><a name="pos962"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> When I was still in the car, when I got out of the car I saw Motsamai shooting at Oupa's direction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line963"><a name="pos963"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Tell me, is Oupa Makubalo - was he arrested later on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line964"><a name="pos964"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> Yes somebody came with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line965"><a name="pos965"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> When he came back to the vehicle what was his condition?</p>
<p class="line" id="line966"><a name="pos966"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> He was walking with Mamome but he looked as if he was scared.</p>
<p class="line" id="line967"><a name="pos967"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Did it look as if he had been assaulted at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line968"><a name="pos968"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> No Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line969"><a name="pos969"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> The people who got hold of him, were they angry with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line970"><a name="pos970"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> I did not realise whether they were angry or not.  It did not come to my mind to check as to whether they were angry or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line971"><a name="pos971"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Was Motsamai angry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line972"><a name="pos972"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> Motsamai was deeply hurt because it was according to - he explained that Oupa killed his informer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line973"><a name="pos973"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Did he not hit him a few times in your presence, I'm talking about Motsamai?</p>
<p class="line" id="line974"><a name="pos974"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> No Sir, I did not realise that.  They arrived with him  we got into the car, we drive off.</p>
<p class="line" id="line975"><a name="pos975"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Where did you take him to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line976"><a name="pos976"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> We came to Fountains</p>
<p class="line" id="line977"><a name="pos977"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Was he assaulted in your presence there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line978"><a name="pos978"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> No Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line979"><a name="pos979"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Were you in his presence for the whole time after you came back to Fountain?</p>
<p class="line" id="line980"><a name="pos980"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> When we arrived I took a car and I drove off because it was already after 4 o'clock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line981"><a name="pos981"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> So you didn't enter into the building with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line982"><a name="pos982"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> I went with them into the building, I took my briefcase, went downstairs and I left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line983"><a name="pos983"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> So what further happened you don't know, do I understand you correctly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line984"><a name="pos984"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line985"><a name="pos985"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> It is my instructions to state to you Sir that you saw clearly how Oupa Makubalo was assaulted in your presence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line986"><a name="pos986"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> That is not so Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line987"><a name="pos987"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Not only by Motsamai but also by Mamome?</p>
<p class="line" id="line988"><a name="pos988"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> No Sir, that is not so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line989"><a name="pos989"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Also by other members present there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line990"><a name="pos990"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> That is not so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line991"><a name="pos991"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> I would like to put to you that it was highly unlikely that somebody who went out to arrest somebody else who had killed one of his informants and that when he got hold of him he did not give him a few smacks.  What do you say to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line992"><a name="pos992"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> Sir, I told you that Motsamai was hurt.  He might have done that but not in my presence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line993"><a name="pos993"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line994"><a name="pos994"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR STANDER</p>
<p class="line" id="line995"><a name="pos995"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...[inaudible]</p>
<p class="line" id="line996"><a name="pos996"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Mr Chairman it is true it is not mentioned in his affidavit, but you will remember in a previous occasion when he himself came to give evidence he said specifically it was part of his evidence which was presented.  I have in any case no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line997"><a name="pos997"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MEMANI:</span> Mr Lesale, do you know Warrant Officer Mbanjani?</p>
<p class="line" id="line998"><a name="pos998"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> Yes Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line999"><a name="pos999"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> You also know he was stationed at Botshabelo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1000"><a name="pos1000"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> Yes Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1001"><a name="pos1001"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And so was Sergeant Smit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1002"><a name="pos1002"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> I not know Smit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1003"><a name="pos1003"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Do you know Warrant Officer van den Berg?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1005"><a name="pos1005"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And he was stationed at Botshabelo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1006"><a name="pos1006"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> Yes Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1007"><a name="pos1007"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And Ngo tells us that you were also stationed at Botshabelo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1008"><a name="pos1008"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> I have never worked in Botshabelo my entire life.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1009"><a name="pos1009"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Now when you knew Ngo, you say you saw him for two or three months isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1010"><a name="pos1010"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1011"><a name="pos1011"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> You worked with him in fact.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1012"><a name="pos1012"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> I was not working with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1013"><a name="pos1013"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> He worked at Fountains isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1014"><a name="pos1014"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1015"><a name="pos1015"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> You said at the time he was being recruited.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1016"><a name="pos1016"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> He was a student constable at that time when I knew him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1017"><a name="pos1017"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> He was being recruited into security branch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1018"><a name="pos1018"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> I said new him at the security branch within the security branch.  I do not know where he was going to be recruited because he was already in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1019"><a name="pos1019"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> So he was already a student constable attached to this security branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1020"><a name="pos1020"></a> </p>
<p class="line" id="line1021"><a name="pos1021"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> That is correct Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1022"><a name="pos1022"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And he worked with other members of the security branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1023"><a name="pos1023"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1024"><a name="pos1024"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Who did he with do you know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1025"><a name="pos1025"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> He was working in Lieutenant Shaw's section I used to see him in the company of Sergeant Mamome and Sergeant Motsamai even though I did not know his duties.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1026"><a name="pos1026"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And Ngo has also told us that you were present on an occasion when certain students were arrested at Botshabelo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1027"><a name="pos1027"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> That is not so, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1028"><a name="pos1028"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Do you recall any occasion when you arrested students at Botshabelo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1029"><a name="pos1029"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> I have never worked in Botshabelo, I have never arrested students in Botshabelo, I have never arrested anyone in Botshabelo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1030"><a name="pos1030"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> There was no friction between yourself and Ngo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1031"><a name="pos1031"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> Up to this day there is no friction, we are still greeting each other.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1032"><a name="pos1032"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And in actual fact you do not care whether he gets amnesty or not, All you want to do is clear your name, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1033"><a name="pos1033"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> I do not know why do you include me in the amnesty issues now because I - we are in good terms with Ngo, I still greet him, we talk outside, now how do you include me in this whole thing of amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1034"><a name="pos1034"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> What I'm saying to you is you do not wish that he does not get amnesty, all you want to do is to say that you are not involved in the things that he says you are involved in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1035"><a name="pos1035"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> Sir, there has never been a friction between myself and Ngo.  There is nothing that I am fighting him against, now why involve me in the issue of amnesty.  I'm not the person who decides whether one should get amnesty or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1036"><a name="pos1036"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Do you know Ramosoeu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1037"><a name="pos1037"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> I know him Sir.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1041"><a name="pos1041"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1042"><a name="pos1042"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And do you know Constable S. Khatlake.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1043"><a name="pos1043"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> I do not know him Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1044"><a name="pos1044"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Could that be spelt Mr Chairman, that's a name we don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1045"><a name="pos1045"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> K-h-a-t-l-a-k-e.  Do you know Sergeant Smit, you said you don't know him, previously.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1046"><a name="pos1046"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...[inaudible]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1047"><a name="pos1047"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> K-h-a-t-l-a-k-e.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1048"><a name="pos1048"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Do you know Constable Tulo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1049"><a name="pos1049"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> No Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1050"><a name="pos1050"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And Constable Samuel Sinyane?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1051"><a name="pos1051"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> I do not know him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1052"><a name="pos1052"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Your rank around '86 was constable?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1053"><a name="pos1053"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1054"><a name="pos1054"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Now, who has said that you participated in the assault of students who were detained at Botshabelo Police Station sometime around 1986, what is your comment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1055"><a name="pos1055"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> Sir, I say I've never worked in Botshabelo, I do not know those students.  I've never been to them.  Even here in Bloemfontein it was not my duty to arrest students.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1056"><a name="pos1056"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Oupa Makubalo was a student isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1057"><a name="pos1057"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> That is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1058"><a name="pos1058"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And you were present when he was arrested isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1059"><a name="pos1059"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1060"><a name="pos1060"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> So you did in fact arrest students isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1061"><a name="pos1061"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> I was not arresting the students.  Motsamai arrived - let me explain this to you, he requested help and I was in the kitchen.  He did not specify, he said to the men who were there: the men who killed my informer is at a certain place, I was told by my other informer, go help me arrest him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1062"><a name="pos1062"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> If you had been given instructions to arrest students would you not have complied to the instruction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1063"><a name="pos1063"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> Who would give me such an instruction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1064"><a name="pos1064"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Persons in command.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1065"><a name="pos1065"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> Sir, if - you're not talking of the section head or the commanding officer, if they give me an instruction I would go and carry it out and this person came asking for help.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1066"><a name="pos1066"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And if you had been given instructions to go arrest at Botshabelo you would have gone obviously.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1067"><a name="pos1067"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> Sir, if the instructions are from the commanding officer, what would I do if he says all the sections should take part, what would I really do, I must comply.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1068"><a name="pos1068"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Now you've known about these proceedings for about six months isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1069"><a name="pos1069"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> Which proceedings Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1070"><a name="pos1070"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> About this hearing, for no less than six months now, isn't it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1071"><a name="pos1071"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> That is correct, even though I do not remember how many months, but if you're saying it's six months, well I know about this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1072"><a name="pos1072"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Now throughout, you knew that Ngo was alleging that you were working at Botshabelo isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1073"><a name="pos1073"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> That is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1074"><a name="pos1074"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And throughout that time you have not taken any steps to produce proof that you were working at a place other than Botshabelo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1075"><a name="pos1075"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> Sir, I have never worked to Botshabelo.  When you cross the street just outside here, you are at the office where I work.  They will take out the files, tell you when did I start working here.  I have never worked in Botshabelo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1076"><a name="pos1076"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And you did for instance carry a pocket book isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1077"><a name="pos1077"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> No Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1078"><a name="pos1078"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> You've had duty sheets isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1079"><a name="pos1079"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> What is a duty sheet, Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1080"><a name="pos1080"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> I think you refer to it as a SAP15, if I'm not mistaken.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1081"><a name="pos1081"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> No I've never seen that in the security branch, I know that it exists in the stations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1082"><a name="pos1082"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Isn't there some form of record of your movements daily or what you do daily?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1083"><a name="pos1083"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> I did not have a pocket book so I did not record what I did yesterday and what I did the day thereafter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1084"><a name="pos1084"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Now have you ever heard of any activists house that was bombed in the township here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1085"><a name="pos1085"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1086"><a name="pos1086"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> If I may take instructions Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1087"><a name="pos1087"></a>	Now I want us to deal with the incident involving Oupa.  First of all you say that you were working with trade unions, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1088"><a name="pos1088"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1089"><a name="pos1089"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And you say you did not know Citi Mzuzwana?  My instructions are that you knew Citi Mzuzwana.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1090"><a name="pos1090"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> Sir, I knew Citi after a long time that I've been here in Bloemfontein.  Jani Mohape was working with SAWU who was helping Mohape to organise, that's when I started knowing him.  I think it was in 1988.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1091"><a name="pos1091"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> So at some stage you did come to know Citi Mzuzwana?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1092"><a name="pos1092"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1093"><a name="pos1093"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And he was an organiser of SAWU?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1094"><a name="pos1094"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> I knew him as the person who was helping Mr Jani Mohape, he was his assistant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1095"><a name="pos1095"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Now you told us that Motsamai told you that he had got the information about the whereabouts of the men who killed his informer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1096"><a name="pos1096"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> That is correct Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1097"><a name="pos1097"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Now you must be mistaken because it is Mamome who came and said that Motsamai or rather that the person who killed Kosi, had been seen somewhere.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1098"><a name="pos1098"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> That is not true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1099"><a name="pos1099"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Now, we were told that Oupa was standing at the gate when you people first approached.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1100"><a name="pos1100"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> If I remember well Sir, this man was standing at the tree with the others.  I do not know whether he was standing at the gate but he standing at the tree with others.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1101"><a name="pos1101"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> You see, Oupa himself told us that he had been with a companion who left him at the gate and went to the shop and when you approached he was alone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1102"><a name="pos1102"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> That is not so.  I'm telling you what I saw.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1103"><a name="pos1103"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Now, you say that when you arrived there, the applicant, Mr Motsamai, started shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1104"><a name="pos1104"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> That is so Sir, he jumped out of the car, he chased this person, he was already running away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1105"><a name="pos1105"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Who was driving?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1106"><a name="pos1106"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> I do not want to commit myself, I do not remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1107"><a name="pos1107"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And where were you sitting in the vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1108"><a name="pos1108"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> I was sitting the second seat starting from the back, that was the second seat from the back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1109"><a name="pos1109"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Now if this were a 10 seater it would be the middle seat?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1110"><a name="pos1110"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> The second seat from the back.  I do not know whether it was in the middle or what but it was the second seat from the back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1111"><a name="pos1111"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> But how many rows of seats did this vehicle have?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1112"><a name="pos1112"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> It was called a 16 seater, I found it here at security branch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1113"><a name="pos1113"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And where was Motsamai seated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1114"><a name="pos1114"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> He was sitting next to the sliding door.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1115"><a name="pos1115"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And that was on the left hand side?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1116"><a name="pos1116"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> Yes Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1117"><a name="pos1117"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And did you consult with your lawyers about this evidence about the incident involving Oupa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1118"><a name="pos1118"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> Yes Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1119"><a name="pos1119"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And were all the people who were present on the occasion when Oupa was shot present at the consultation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1120"><a name="pos1120"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> I was called alone by my lawyer. I was alone, I was not called with the others.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1121"><a name="pos1121"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> When were you called?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1122"><a name="pos1122"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> It was last year.  I went to Pretoria to meet with him.  I do not remember the month.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1123"><a name="pos1123"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Was that the same occasion as when the rest of the people went in a Kombi and you were called into the attorney's office one by one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1124"><a name="pos1124"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> I was driving with my car, I've never driven with people in the Kombi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1125"><a name="pos1125"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Now you told your lawyers at that stage that Motsamai was sitting on the left hand side next to the sliding door.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1126"><a name="pos1126"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> I did not say that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1127"><a name="pos1127"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> You didn't tell them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1128"><a name="pos1128"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> They did not ask me that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1129"><a name="pos1129"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Did they ask you who shot first?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1130"><a name="pos1130"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> They did not ask me who shot first. They asked who shot not first, who shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1131"><a name="pos1131"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And you told that Motsamai shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1132"><a name="pos1132"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1133"><a name="pos1133"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> What did you say that Oupa was at the stage when Motsamai shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1134"><a name="pos1134"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> I do not remember whether they asked me that, I do not remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1135"><a name="pos1135"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Did you describe the incident to them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1136"><a name="pos1136"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> I described the incident to them.  I told them that we arrived at Botshabelo where we were helping Mr Motsamai to arrest the person he alleged that killed his informer and that man was arrested on that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1137"><a name="pos1137"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Didn't they ask you how it came about that Motsamai started shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1138"><a name="pos1138"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> I don't remember if they did ask they asked.  I do not know the contents of my statement but if that is so I must of told them that he shot because this man was running away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1139"><a name="pos1139"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Now Mr Lesale, did you - are you sure in your mind that it is Motsamai only who shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1140"><a name="pos1140"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> That is correct Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1141"><a name="pos1141"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> My instructions are that several people shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1142"><a name="pos1142"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> I do not know that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1143"><a name="pos1143"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And you'll not dispute that several people shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1144"><a name="pos1144"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> I do not know about other people who shot.  I saw Mr Motsamai shooting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1145"><a name="pos1145"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> How many times did he shoot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1146"><a name="pos1146"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> I explained that it was several times, I do not know how many times.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1147"><a name="pos1147"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And where were you as he was shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1148"><a name="pos1148"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> I remained behind the Kombi.  I got out of the Kombi and stood outside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1149"><a name="pos1149"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And where was Oupa when Motsamai was shooting at him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1150"><a name="pos1150"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> Sir, he was running next to the fences in the street.  I last saw getting into the houses, but I saw them coming back with him later.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1151"><a name="pos1151"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Now, did they catch him in the same street that he was running in when you first saw him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1152"><a name="pos1152"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> I don't know whether they caught him in the yards or in the next street I do not know, I just saw them appearing with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1153"><a name="pos1153"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> So at some stage they were out of your sight.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1154"><a name="pos1154"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1155"><a name="pos1155"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> So you cannot say that the others did not shoot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1156"><a name="pos1156"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> That is correct, I told you about the person I saw shooting, I won't say anything about the others.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1157"><a name="pos1157"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And the others were also chasing, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1158"><a name="pos1158"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1159"><a name="pos1159"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And anyone who said that the person who shot first was sitting on the right hand side is definitely wrong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1160"><a name="pos1160"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> Can you please repeat that question, I do not understand it clearly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1161"><a name="pos1161"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Any person who says that the person who started shooting was sitting on the right hand side of the Kombi is definitely wrong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1162"><a name="pos1162"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> That is correct.  Nobody shot whilst we were inside the car, I never saw a person shooting from inside the Kombi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1163"><a name="pos1163"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And yet that is what was put to witnesses, I think to the applicant himself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1164"><a name="pos1164"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> Who is the applicant Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1165"><a name="pos1165"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Mr Motsamai.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1166"><a name="pos1166"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> I do not know it that way Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1167"><a name="pos1167"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Can we perhaps be referred to the passage that my learned relying upon Mr Chairman.  The incident is described in cross-examination at page 1003 and onwards in the record.  I'm not disputing it, I would just like to know where the passage is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1168"><a name="pos1168"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Now, Mr Chairman, if he's not disputing it, why must we look at the record and be interrupted, I mean if he's not disputing it, we don't have any reason then to be looking at the record.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1169"><a name="pos1169"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> He's not disputing as I understand because he hasn't checked the record that it is not there.  But he does not recollect it, so he wants you to tell him if it is because he may dispute it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1170"><a name="pos1170"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> I'm not relying on the record for this, I'm relying on my recollection of the evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1171"><a name="pos1171"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you now putting something to the witness that you say you remember having been said in the evidence about three months ago.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1172"><a name="pos1172"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1173"><a name="pos1173"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRMAN:</span> And you're not relying, you haven't checked it in the record?  Well I think you should be very careful, Mr Mamome and specifically putting to a witness that it was something was said if you are merely relying on your memory of months ago.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1174"><a name="pos1174"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> That I will do Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1175"><a name="pos1175"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, page 1005 appears to be the portion upon which this evidence is based, it appears that Mr Motsamai gave that evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1176"><a name="pos1176"></a>	Mr Chairman, I place it on record that up to page 1009 I certainly never put what has just been put to this witness to Mr Motsamai.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1177"><a name="pos1177"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Mr Chairman I withdraw the question as I put it.  Now, when Mr Motsamai started shooting did anyone stop Motsamai from shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1178"><a name="pos1178"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> No Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1179"><a name="pos1179"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Did any of you thereafter ask him why he was shooting at Oupa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1180"><a name="pos1180"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> No Sir I don't know, I didn't hear that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1181"><a name="pos1181"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And was Motsamai acting correctly by shooting at Oupa at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1182"><a name="pos1182"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> Hi's feelings told him that he took the right step.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1183"><a name="pos1183"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> When you observed, was it the right thing to do for Motsamai to shoot at Oupa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1184"><a name="pos1184"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> You asking me a different question.  I would not respond on behalf of his feelings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1185"><a name="pos1185"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> I'm saying that you are a policeman and there is Motsamai starting to shoot a civilian, when you looked at him did you see he was acting properly as a policeman at the stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1186"><a name="pos1186"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> He knew Oupa and if it was myself in his position I would not shoot at him because I would know where to find him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1187"><a name="pos1187"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Now why didn't you say: "Stop don't shoot this man, we'll catch him later"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1188"><a name="pos1188"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> Who am I to run after Motsamai shouting: "Stop shooting, stop shooting".  It was even my first to hear of Oupa and I saw him when I brought him back to the car.  Who am I really to run after Motsamai to tell him not to shoot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1189"><a name="pos1189"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Do you know any reason why no charges of attempted murder were led against Motsamai?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1190"><a name="pos1190"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> What case are you talking about Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1191"><a name="pos1191"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> I am saying to you, do you know if any - why charges of attempted murder were not laid against Motsamai?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1192"><a name="pos1192"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> Not according to my knowledge, I do not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1193"><a name="pos1193"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> May I ask, what channel is Sotho on, because I don't think that the interpretation is correct.  On what channel is Sotho?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1194"><a name="pos1194"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> Chairperson the Sotho is on channel 3.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1195"><a name="pos1195"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Now I was saying do you know why there was no charge of attempted murder laid against Motsamai?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1196"><a name="pos1196"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> I do not know Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1197"><a name="pos1197"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> The answer is ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1198"><a name="pos1198"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was a charge of murder laid against Oupa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1199"><a name="pos1199"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> If I remember very well, it looks like he was charged for the murder of Motsamai's informer.  I do not remember well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1200"><a name="pos1200"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And these shots were fired while he was trying to escape arrest running away from Motsamai?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1201"><a name="pos1201"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> I do not know whether Oupa laid charges, I do not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1202"><a name="pos1202"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> But that's not an answer on</p>
<p class="line" id="line1203"><a name="pos1203"></a>what was asked from you, Listen to the question.  Have you heard the Chairperson's question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1204"><a name="pos1204"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> Let the Chairperson repeat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1205"><a name="pos1205"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> These shots were fired by Motsamai at somebody who was apparently seeking to escape from being arrested on the charge of murder.  He was running away when he saw the police, Is that the position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1206"><a name="pos1206"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> Motsamai shot at Oupa while Oupa was running away, because when the Kombi stopped, he ran then he got out of the car, while Oupa was running he shot at him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1207"><a name="pos1207"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And do you know why Motsamai was not subjected to any disciplinary for this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1208"><a name="pos1208"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can a junior police officer possibly answer that question, isn't that a decision taken at a higher ranking officers?  This decision to prosecute is taken by the Attorney General isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1209"><a name="pos1209"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Well Chairperson it's possible for a person to answer the question and say: "I know this is the reason or I do not know".  What I can't put to him is that he should have known.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1210"><a name="pos1210"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> I do not know why Motsamai was not charged,  he would be in a position to tell.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1211"><a name="pos1211"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Now, I put it to you that all of you, including Motsamai, chased Oupa and some of you shot at him and neither of you cared whether or not Oupa would die as a result.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1212"><a name="pos1212"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> That is not correct Sir, I was not after Oupa Makubalo, I was remaining at the car and I did not shoot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1213"><a name="pos1213"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And that you were also present when he was assaulted after his arrest and ...[indistinct] on the assault on him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1214"><a name="pos1214"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> That is not correct Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1215"><a name="pos1215"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Mr Chairman I will withdraw the last part which says he participated in the assault, I'm not so sure now.  Those are my questions Chairperson.  Just one second Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1216"><a name="pos1216"></a>	Now, Mr Lesale at the time when you saw Ngo at the police station for about two to three months, he used to carry a gun.  Do you remember that?  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1217"><a name="pos1217"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> I saw him at the offices of the security branch not in the police station.  It is true I saw a pistol on his person, a small one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1218"><a name="pos1218"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And student constables were not allowed to carry firearms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1219"><a name="pos1219"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> Sir, myself, even before I went to Hammanskraal, I was not allowed to carry a gun or anything that can harm.  I always worked under a person who is the senior, who has been to the college already.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1220"><a name="pos1220"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And lastly, did you have differences with Motsamai?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1221"><a name="pos1221"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> That is not so Sir, Motsamai is my friend, my big friend.  His family, his children up to the day, we've never had problems.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1222"><a name="pos1222"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> No further questions Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1223"><a name="pos1223"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MEMANI</p>
<p class="line" id="line1224"><a name="pos1224"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Brink?</p>

I did not realise we would go this quickly today I must apologise, just to see which witnesses are here and just get myself organised. It won't take long, ten minutes perhaps Mr Chairman.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1240"><a name="pos1240"></a><span class="speaker">PHIKANI PETRUS MININGWA:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1241"><a name="pos1241"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Miningwa, is your surname spelt  M-i-n-i-n-g-w-a?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1242"><a name="pos1242"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1243"><a name="pos1243"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And your christian names: P-h-i-k-a-n-i, Phikani, Petrus?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1244"><a name="pos1244"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> That is correct Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1245"><a name="pos1245"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Is it correct that last year you became aware that you were being implicated by Mr Motsamai in certain alleged illegal acts?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1246"><a name="pos1246"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> That is correct Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1247"><a name="pos1247"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you then sign this affidavit before Mr Wagener and is a copy of that affidavit before you now?  I'm sorry that's not correctly put.  Did you go and speak to the attorney Mr Wagener and make an affidavit of which a copy is before you now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1248"><a name="pos1248"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> That is so Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1249"><a name="pos1249"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Would you confirm the correctness and the truthfulness of the contents of that affidavit now in your evidence as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1250"><a name="pos1250"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> That is correct Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1251"><a name="pos1251"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...[inaudible]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1252"><a name="pos1252"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> 100 Mr Chairman.  Thank you Mr Chairman.  	Now is it true that Mr Motsamai implicates you in two instances - and that would be paragraphs 6 and 14 at page 147 and 148 Mr Chairman of bundle A.  To refresh your memory I will read to you what Mr Motsamai had said.  He said: he, Mamome, Constable Lesale, Constable Miningwa petrol bombed the parental home of Citi Mzuzwana.  Now is there any truth in this allegation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1253"><a name="pos1253"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> No, I do not know such a thing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1254"><a name="pos1254"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> When did you join the police Mr Miningwa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1255"><a name="pos1255"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> I joined the police in 1981 on the 21st January.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1256"><a name="pos1256"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And during - and did you join the security branch as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1257"><a name="pos1257"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1258"><a name="pos1258"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And from what date was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1259"><a name="pos1259"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> When I left the college at Hammanskraal, I was sent to the security branch at Stellenbosch.  I came back from Stellenbosch, that was in 1982 when I went to Stellenbosch from the college.  Because of the weather that did not suit me in Stellenbosch I was transferred to Bloemfontein in 1983.  On the 15th September and I started working at the special branch in Bloemfontein on 1st October 1983.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1260"><a name="pos1260"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you.  Now what section did you work in the security branch Mr Miningwa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1261"><a name="pos1261"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> When I arrived in Bloemfontein, I worked with Mr Prinsloo, he is now  a Colonel but at the time he was Warrant Officer.  We were working with the trade unions and churches.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1262"><a name="pos1262"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And who was in that section together with you and Mr Prinsloo in the section of trade unions and churches?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1263"><a name="pos1263"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> I worked all by myself as a black man, I'm not including the whites.  We were three when we started then at the end we were five.  If I remember very well we went to fetch ...[indistinct] from De Wets Dorp, then we were two people and five white people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1264"><a name="pos1264"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And who were the two black people, yourself and?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1265"><a name="pos1265"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> It was myself, he's Sergeant Lesale.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1266"><a name="pos1266"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What was your rank in 1986 or '85?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1267"><a name="pos1267"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> I was still a constable.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1268"><a name="pos1268"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Coming then to the next paragraph, paragraph 14, that paragraph relates to a day when you went together with some other persons to go and assist to arrest Oupa Makubalo.  Can you remember that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1269"><a name="pos1269"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> Sir, I remember that day but I was personally not among that group.  I did not drive with them.  If I remember very well it was the time to knock off at work, it was at 4 o'clock I was using Mr Prinsloo's car when this group left to go and fetch Oupa Makubalo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1270"><a name="pos1270"></a>	I was supposed to drive with Mr Prinsloo to take him home to drop him off and come back with his car because we were supposed to work that night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1271"><a name="pos1271"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> So what your saying is you weren't present at all during that incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1272"><a name="pos1272"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> Not at all, I was not there Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1273"><a name="pos1273"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Now Mr Ngo has also implicated you in regard to the group of people who were brought to Bloemfontein and in the bundle, Mr Chairman, page 30, bundle A of course page 30, third last name - it looks like number 11, it's a misspelt name but it can only refer to this witness, and Mr Ngo said that while these 19 people were detained and interrogated, members of the security branch who were organised - could you give me a moment, Mr Chairman, I'm not sure whether this is Bloemfontein or Botshabelo, ja it is Bloemfontein Mr Chairman, members of the security branch who were organised by Colonel Coetzee and Colonel Stevenson to beat up and torture these comrades were - and your name was then included, in other words it was suggested by Mr Ngo that you in fact beat up and tortured the comrades.  	Mr Chairman it corresponds with page 181 of the evidence of Mr Ngo where it is quite clear that this is the witness that is mentioned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1274"><a name="pos1274"></a>	Now, did you have anything to do with the comrades who were arrested by the South African Defence Force and transferred from Lady Brand to Bloemfontein?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1275"><a name="pos1275"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> Sir, I saw these children but I personally did not have anything to do with their interrogation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1276"><a name="pos1276"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you assault any of them or did you see anybody assault them in your presence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1277"><a name="pos1277"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> I did not even touch one of them because I was not involved in the interrogation and furthermore, I did not see any assault.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1278"><a name="pos1278"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What do you say if an allegation is made that you committed illegal or unlawful acts, if Mr Motsamai and Ngo say that, any illegal acts?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1279"><a name="pos1279"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> Not at all Sir, I do not know anything about the alleged incidents before this commission, that is lie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1280"><a name="pos1280"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well there's just one other thing which has not been brought up in cross-examination.  There has been a suggestion that your group of people who went up to Pretoria, were either unduly influenced or forced by Colonel Erasmus to go and see an attorney and that you were told what to say in your affidavits.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1281"><a name="pos1281"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Mr Chairman, this is not entirely correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1282"><a name="pos1282"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You say that this is not correct, they were not forced to go and see an attorney and told what to say in their affidavits or do you say it's not correct it was said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1283"><a name="pos1283"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Yes Chairperson.  The evidence was not that people were unduly influenced or forced to say things they did not want to say, the evidence was that Mr Motsamai was tricked into a situation where he found himself being at Pretoria with an attorney.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1284"><a name="pos1284"></a>	He had believed that they were going to do their own amnesties.  However, when they arrived there, they saw an attorney who wanted, who he realised wanted them to speak with one voice.  That attorney took them one by one into an office and inside that office, he was reading from a certain document and he would read from the document and seek confirmation of what he had read from the applicant, that is my recollection.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1285"><a name="pos1285"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Would you bear with me a moment, my attorney also has a different view about the matter from myself, Mr Chairman, may I just discuss it with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1286"><a name="pos1286"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is it necessary to raise it at this stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1287"><a name="pos1287"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well Mr Chairman, I would just like to bring it to your attention because an issue had been made of it and no cross-examination has been directed in that regard and that's why I simply brought it to your attention.  It's not for me really to raise it Mr Chairman, you're quite correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1288"><a name="pos1288"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> If I may remind my learned friend, it was him who was pursuing the matter when he was trying to show that Mr Motsamai had departed from what he had previously said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1289"><a name="pos1289"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well, in any event, my question was inappropriate because there were two groups that went up and Mr Miningwa was part of the second group which was not part of - when the allegation was made that Mr Motsamai signed the affidavit, so may I withdraw the whole question, Mr Chairman, I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1290"><a name="pos1290"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR VISSER</p>
<p class="line" id="line1291"><a name="pos1291"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...[inaudible]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1292"><a name="pos1292"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR STANDER:</span> Mr Miningwa, I understand that you and Oupa Makubalo on occasions were together at school?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1293"><a name="pos1293"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1294"><a name="pos1294"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Will you agree with me that he knew you very well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1295"><a name="pos1295"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1296"><a name="pos1296"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Was Oupa Makubalo part of the group of 19 that was arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1297"><a name="pos1297"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1298"><a name="pos1298"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Did you see him there as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1299"><a name="pos1299"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> I saw him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1300"><a name="pos1300"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Did you have part in the questioning of this group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1301"><a name="pos1301"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> That is not so Chairperson, I explained that I never had any association with them.  I saw them but I did not take part in their interrogation, not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1302"><a name="pos1302"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Where you present at the offices that day, I'm talking sort of throughout the day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1303"><a name="pos1303"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> When these children arrived I did not see them.  I saw them during teatime.  It was about to 10 - it was between 9 and 10 o'clock because I was always early than anybody else.  I had other things to do because I would start working at 6 o'clock to start working and when I go to tea at 9 o'clock, they were all assembled in the kitchen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1304"><a name="pos1304"></a>	Well I do not remember whether they were all in there but I remember seeing a group and I heard that this was a group of children who tried to skip the country to Lesotho.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1305"><a name="pos1305"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Do you know who questioned them that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1306"><a name="pos1306"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> I do not know Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1307"><a name="pos1307"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Where is your office situated in Fountain Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1308"><a name="pos1308"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> If you listen to Mr Mbanjani's evidence when he said in 1986 he was working there, that is the kind of work I did from 1986.  I was in the office that was occupied by Mr Mbanjani.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1309"><a name="pos1309"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Can you please answer the question, where was your office?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1310"><a name="pos1310"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> I think to bring a close to my answer, it is where Mr Mbanjani - when Mr Mbanjani was working in 1986, he had an office and that is the office I occupied.  He demonstrated the distance yesterday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1311"><a name="pos1311"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Could you just say where the office was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1312"><a name="pos1312"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> It was on the 5th floor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1313"><a name="pos1313"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Was your office that looked out on so called: "Violent Street"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1314"><a name="pos1314"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> My door was not facing Violent Street, my office faced the main door when you enter the 5th floor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1315"><a name="pos1315"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Were any of the people in that group in your office the day they were questioned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1316"><a name="pos1316"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> Not at all Sir, even the members who worked at Fountain did not get into the office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1317"><a name="pos1317"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Sir, the question is simple, were any of these people, any of this group of people questioned on that day, even though you say that you had no part in that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1318"><a name="pos1318"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...[inaudible] not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1319"><a name="pos1319"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And he asked Mr Chairman, with respect, whether they were interrogated in that office?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1320"><a name="pos1320"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And the answer was: "not at all".</p>
<p class="line" id="line1321"><a name="pos1321"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> All right Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1322"><a name="pos1322"></a>	Did you see any of these people during the day except for the time when you went to have tea like you told us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1323"><a name="pos1323"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> If I remember well, at quarter to four I would leave, either go to the kitchen or go somewhere and  I saw them and I heard that they had been taken to different places where they were being detained.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1324"><a name="pos1324"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Tell me, if some of them were assaulted to such an extent that they screamed, would you have heard that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1325"><a name="pos1325"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> Sir, let me shortly explain.  Our offices were a bit far and I was always in a noisy area putting earphones such as these ones on my ears and I would not be in the position to hear because I would be listening at the tapes and I used to write as I'm listening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1326"><a name="pos1326"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> In other words are you're saying that it's possible that there was a screaming but you could not hear that because of the earphones?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1327"><a name="pos1327"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> Yes Sir, I did not hear screams, if there were screams I did not hear them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1328"><a name="pos1328"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Is it possible that there was screaming?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1329"><a name="pos1329"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> I do not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1330"><a name="pos1330"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Did you see some of these people later on that day again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1331"><a name="pos1331"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> I told you Sir, I said I think I saw them at about quarter to four when it was prepared for them to leave.  They were taken by other members who took them away, members of the security branch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1332"><a name="pos1332"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Could you see any of them to ascertain whether or not they were assaulted on that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1333"><a name="pos1333"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> When I went to the kitchen they passed in a group, I did not look them in the face.  I did not see as to whether they were attacked or not, I not even see bruises on their faces.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1334"><a name="pos1334"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Tell me, do you know a person by the name of Kwedi Kwedi?  I'm going to spell this, K-w-e-d-i and again, K-w-e-d-i.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1335"><a name="pos1335"></a><span class="speaker">MR LESALE:</span> This is my first time to hear of Kwedi Kwedi, maybe it's another name.  If it is his real name, I do not know this name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1336"><a name="pos1336"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> You see, Sir, it's my instructions that you were not that passive that day as you try to insinuate here, you played an active role in the questioning and this Kwedi Kwedi was one of the people that you questioned and also assaulted on that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1337"><a name="pos1337"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> I do not know Kwedi Kwedi, I do not know Kwedi Kwedi.  I never took part in the interrogation of these people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1338"><a name="pos1338"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Tell me, the day - I am know moving on to the next incident of Oupa Makubalo, at what time do you say they came back to Fountain Street with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1339"><a name="pos1339"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> Sir, I did not go back to Fountain, it was time to go home.  I went to Belisera Park to drop Mr Prinsloo then I left, I went to the township.  I was knocking off, I was going home I did not go back to the office because that evening I was going to go back to work.  That is the reason I went to Mr Prinsloo to drop him at home so that I can get the car to use it that evening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1340"><a name="pos1340"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> In other words you never saw them bringing back to Fountains Street that evening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1341"><a name="pos1341"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> You were also not with them when picked them up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1342"><a name="pos1342"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1343"><a name="pos1343"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> But it is my instructions to put it to you that you were also one of the people who in fact went to pick him up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1344"><a name="pos1344"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> I did not remember that.  I am certain I am talking perfectly when I say I was not there when Makubalo was fetched.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1345"><a name="pos1345"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> If you say you cannot remember that, are you uncertain or what do you mean?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1346"><a name="pos1346"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> Sir, let me put it in Afrikaans.  I am positive I did not participate in the Makubalo incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1347"><a name="pos1347"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> Did you see him at all afterwards, whether the next day or any day thereafter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1348"><a name="pos1348"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> Because I was always confined to my workplace I would not say I did not see him.  With regards to this incident, I do not remember whether I saw days thereafter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1349"><a name="pos1349"></a><span class="speaker">MR STANDER:</span> I have no further questions, thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1350"><a name="pos1350"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR STANDER</p>
<p class="line" id="line1351"><a name="pos1351"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MEMANI:</span> Mr Miningwa, what were you doing just before  Motsamai and others went to fetch Makubalo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1352"><a name="pos1352"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> If I remember well, I had the left the office, I was in the kitchen, that's where we drink tea.  You know after working we meet in the kitchen to have a cup of tea, we were standing in the kitchen just talking.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1353"><a name="pos1353"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And what had you been doing just before you went for tea?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1354"><a name="pos1354"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> I was listening to the tapes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1355"><a name="pos1355"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And you listen to tapes every day of your life in the office isn't it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1356"><a name="pos1356"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> It was my duty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1357"><a name="pos1357"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> It was also usual that you should go - you had to come back to work at night isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1358"><a name="pos1358"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> Sometimes, it was not every day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1359"><a name="pos1359"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> But it happened often?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1360"><a name="pos1360"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> Yes that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1361"><a name="pos1361"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Now what makes you recall these things which form part of your routine so much today more than ten years after the incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1362"><a name="pos1362"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> I think if you are committed to your work, if that is your daily routine, I used to do that in the mornings and in the evenings.  I would remember many incidents relating to that specific duty that I was doing.  Some might even slip my mind but most I will remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1363"><a name="pos1363"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> You see, what surprises me is that on your version, nothing amiss happened about Oupa Makubalo that you know of and you had no interest in his arrest.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1364"><a name="pos1364"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> I did not have interest in Makubalo's arrest, he was not arrested alone.  I did not have interest because I was not working with them.  If I happened to work with them I would have had interest to listen to them, the reasons for them to be arrested, where they were, because I was not working with him I did not have interest.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1365"><a name="pos1365"></a>	I heard from my colleagues what they did, that is the reason why I did not have interest to know about them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1366"><a name="pos1366"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And Mr Makubalo told us that he was detained at Fountains more than once.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1367"><a name="pos1367"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1368"><a name="pos1368"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And yet on this occasion which you had nothing to do with, you even recalled that it was just before four when he was arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1369"><a name="pos1369"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> Sir, I remember well because I was in the kitchen when it was said that Makubalo would be fetched.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1370"><a name="pos1370"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who said this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1371"><a name="pos1371"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> I don't want to rely on somebody's evidence but I do not remember well who came and talked about Makubalo because after that I just saw people standing up and going out.  I do not remember personally who came and said that Makubalo must be fetched.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1372"><a name="pos1372"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Now I'm told that Makubalo was fetched just before four and that you were present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1373"><a name="pos1373"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> No Sir, I was not present when Makubalo was fetched.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1374"><a name="pos1374"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And that when you returned with Makubalo to the police station it was well after four.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1375"><a name="pos1375"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> That is the reason I say to you it was the time to knock off because when they took different directions I got into the car with Mr Prinsloo to take him home.  Their return with Makubalo to the police station, I was not there, I did not go back to the office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1376"><a name="pos1376"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Did you see any person actually leave the office to go and fetch Makubalo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1377"><a name="pos1377"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> Repeat your question Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1378"><a name="pos1378"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Did you see any person actually leave the office to go and fetch Makubalo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1379"><a name="pos1379"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> Members were in the kitchen, they went out, I do not know who got into the car but I don't want to say we were almost in the kitchen, I do not remember who went out because they got into the offices and then they left.  I do not know among them who left to go and help about the fetching of Makubalo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1380"><a name="pos1380"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And can you dispute that it is Mamome who in fact came and said that he had got information about the whereabouts of Makubalo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1381"><a name="pos1381"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> I would not dispute that, I said earlier that I don't want to rely on somebody else's evidence. I do not remember who came with that information that Makubalo is at a certain place and that he should be fetched, I do not remember who came out with that instruction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1382"><a name="pos1382"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Now, did you not hear screams - if I may just ask,  you know I don't want to ask these questions if Mr Stander has asked them.  Now on that day you say you couldn't hear because you had you earphones on.  What time did you start working?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1383"><a name="pos1383"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think you should make it clear that you've gone to a different day now.   You're just saying on that day and you've been talking about the day Oupa was fetched.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1384"><a name="pos1384"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> I'm indebted to His Lordship.  Now Mr Miningwa, I want us to go to the 6th April 1986.  That is the day when about 20 peoples were detained who had been attempting to skip the border.  You told us that you did not hear screams because you were wearing earphones, headphones isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1385"><a name="pos1385"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1386"><a name="pos1386"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And tell me, what were you listening at?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1387"><a name="pos1387"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Tapes, as he explained.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1388"><a name="pos1388"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Well I meant what tapes were you listening at?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1389"><a name="pos1389"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> These are round tapes, you put them into the machine and you listen and while listening you write.  You write what you think is important from the conversation you're listening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1390"><a name="pos1390"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> What were the tapes about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1391"><a name="pos1391"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> These were the trade union tapes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1392"><a name="pos1392"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Now I'm sure then that if you had to write important things you'd have to switch the tape off and give yourself time to make notes at various intervals.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1393"><a name="pos1393"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> That is correct.  I have explained that if ever there was anything important I would stop the tape and write.  Now most of the time there is nothing that is that important so you have to listen as it is rotating, well this is very important, you stop and you write.  But most of the time it would be on your ears so and you are very careful so that you don't skip anything that is important to be written down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1394"><a name="pos1394"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And I'm sure that you're entitled to a tea break and a lunch break as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1395"><a name="pos1395"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> I told you.  I answered that I saw these children at the time that I went for tea, I explained that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1396"><a name="pos1396"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And during your lunch hour?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1397"><a name="pos1397"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> I did not have lunch most of the times.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1398"><a name="pos1398"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And I am sure that whilst you were busy listening to these tapes from time to time you had to communicate with some of your colleagues.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1399"><a name="pos1399"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> Not at all because they did not have access to this room.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1400"><a name="pos1400"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Are you saying that you never go out to give reports to your superiors, to ask something of your colleagues about these things you are listening to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1401"><a name="pos1401"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> At quarter to four I would take them to the immediate superior when we went for parades but most of the time you would come to ask: "Haven't you found anything important up to this far?"  If I say: "No", he would leave and then I would carry on.  If I say: "Yes", he takes what I give him and then he will go to the 4th floor to write down what I've given him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1402"><a name="pos1402"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Look, Mr Miningwa, I put it to you that on that day every member of the security branch had an interest in the people who were arrested.  Every member of the security branch would have wanted to know whether there were any people who were within what I'll call his profile.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1403"><a name="pos1403"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> Sir, I told you that I was not working with the children, I was working with mothers and fathers, the workers, people of the trade unions.  It was another different section responsible for the children, like Motsamai and Mamome among others.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1404"><a name="pos1404"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> You see Mr Miningwa, these people were not arrested or detained from the school, they were picked up at the border so at some stage you must not have known that they were just school children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1405"><a name="pos1405"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> They were known.  It was not the first time to be - they were not known the first time they were arrested, they were activists, they were school kids.  When they wanted to skip the country, it was during the time of schooling, they were still in schools.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1406"><a name="pos1406"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And I want to say to you that you are a human being, you would have been at least curious and wanted to know what was happening on that day when there were so many children, so many people arrested at a go on that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1407"><a name="pos1407"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> Sir, I heard during tea break and I explained I started working early on that day at about 6  to come and arrange my tapes, to put them in order.  Now when they arrived at half past seven, the others, I did not go out, I sat down, listened to the tape.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1408"><a name="pos1408"></a>	During tea time when I went for tea I saw them and I was told that they were trying to skip the country, they were arrested in Ladybrand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1409"><a name="pos1409"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> At tea time at quarter to four that you saw them for the first time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1410"><a name="pos1410"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He has explained several times that it was at 10  in the morning when he went to tea, hasn't he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1411"><a name="pos1411"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> I'm indebted to the chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1412"><a name="pos1412"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How much longer are you going to be?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1413"><a name="pos1413"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> I'm also instructed that other members of the security branch were allowed to enter the room in which you listened to tapes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1414"><a name="pos1414"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How much longer are you going to be?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1415"><a name="pos1415"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Oh, I thought I answered that Chairperson and I said I'm not going to be very long.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1416"><a name="pos1416"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Very well carry on because people have made arrangements.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1417"><a name="pos1417"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> As the chair pleases.  In that case Chairperson, it may be a convenient time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1418"><a name="pos1418"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You don't think you'll finish in the next five minutes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1419"><a name="pos1419"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Well I'm afraid to carry the burden of inconveniencing people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1420"><a name="pos1420"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well carry on for five minutes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1421"><a name="pos1421"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> As the chair pleases.  Now Mr Miningwa, we also have been told that you were in the company of Mr Motsamai when Winnie Mandela's clinic was bombed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1422"><a name="pos1422"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> I know nothing about that incident, I was not present.  Let me say I do not know anything about this, I was not present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1423"><a name="pos1423"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And you were also present when the house of Citi Mzuzwana was bombed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1424"><a name="pos1424"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> I started knowing about the bombing of Citi Mzuzwana's home when I saw the documents or the papers that were brought to me by my attorneys about the alleged activities by Motsamai.  I never knew Mr Mzuzwana's home to be burnt.  The house that I know that is was burnt it's Mzuzwana's house personally.   I would tell you why I knew about this, I was working as a - with the trade unionist.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1425"><a name="pos1425"></a>	Now each and every person's individual profile was supposed to be on date.  Now the people whom we used, the informers, told me that Citi's house was burnt down.  I wrote a report and my immediate superior, who was Prinsloo, said go and inspect how the house was burnt.  It was a four roomed house and the big window was broken.  The curtains, I remember very well, they were pink in colour, but you'd see they had smoke as if they were burnt.  That is the reason why I knew about Citi's house, not his parents house.  It's my first time to hear today that his parent's home was burnt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1426"><a name="pos1426"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> And I'm instructed that you knew about both Mzuzwana's house and his parental home because in the one file, there was a sub-file, in Mzuzwana's file, there was a sub-file about his parental home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1427"><a name="pos1427"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> I do not know, I did not read about it, it's my first time to hear it.  I only know the incident I just told you, I know nothing about his parent's house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1428"><a name="pos1428"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Are you saying that you did not read Mzuzwana's file?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1429"><a name="pos1429"></a><span class="speaker">MR MININGWA:</span> I'm explaining, I did not know.  I told you I did not read about it, I did not find that incident.  The incident that was noted there, was the one written by me when I reported in his file because he would write down and he'd put the copy in the file and then you have to make an entry: "On such a date Citi's house was burnt down", then you put it in the file, I did that entry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1430"><a name="pos1430"></a><span class="speaker">MR MEMANI:</span> Mr Chairman, it seems this is a convenient time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1431"><a name="pos1431"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Very well, we'll adjourn till 9H00 Monday morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1432"><a name="pos1432"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line1433"><a name="pos1433"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
