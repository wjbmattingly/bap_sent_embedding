Like we are here, we've got to finish everything here in Bloemfontein.  We won't come back and should there be a matter that is outstanding, we will feel very bad because we had undertaken, we have been just told last week Tuesday by Parliament because they summoned us that we've got to finish.  We wouldn't want to put anybody through what we are doing right now, but I say with some little co-operation, let's all do it because we are prepared to hear every applicant who is outstanding and that goes for the other applicants that tomorrow we would start slightly early and go up to 4.30 to accommodate everybody.  It's in the interest of not only the Panel, but in the interest of everybody, the country as such, that people have been seen to have prosecuted their applications and we had to listen to those applications because my hours start at 10 to 4, those are my hours when I'm in court, 10 to 4 and nothing else, but I'm going a mile extra in these proceedings, so let's have that co-operation because people will have cause to complain that we skipped Bloemfontein, whereas it was not in our making and we want you, Mr Lebea, to understand that as well.  We're not saying we would listen to anybody who is indisposed, but please, people should bear in mind that we should be accommodated as well.  Our life-span is limited.  After the end of August there won't be hearings unless special dispensation is made for that, so like we've gone past Bloemfontein, it will be by special dispensation that we would come back to Bloemfontein.  We are no longer coming back to Bloemfontein.  Please, I want everybody to understand this and I would suggest that we will recuse you for today and start at 9 with you and call Mr Pumulo and see how far we can go with Mr Pumulo.",
