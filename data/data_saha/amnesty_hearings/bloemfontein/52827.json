Mr Chairman, I wouldn't bother the Committee regarding the policies of PAC and APLA, I would just go to the ...[indistinct].\n\tMr Chairman, it is not in dispute that the applicants were members of APLA and that it also transpired that at the time of the operation they were commanded by the person called Prof.  Although Mr Chairman, I must confess that we did not have evidence.  I consulted with them regarding who Prof is themselves.  Unfortunately I couldn't get from them but it was through my investigation as to who was Prof in this matter.  I must confess it was difficult because I was not going to give evidence and I wouldn't adduce from them because they didn't know his real name.  But they were messing up when it comes to that, although they heard that he is from Ngcobo in Transkei.  He was Tolbut, the real surname was Tolbut and he died in that incident.  He was from Transkei at Ngcobo.\n\tSo if one takes into account that Tolbut, if the Committee accepts that Tolbut was all the way from Ngcobo in Transkei and was here at Free State, one would wonder if he would come all the way from Transkei just only to rob at Botshabelo.  So it is clear that is was something more than that.  He was here on a specific mission and that that specific mission was to carry the struggle forward and for their survival because of the limited funds, if I can adduce from the evidence, is that if they have to operate they must have arms.  \n\tIt is clear even in this operation, they only had one firearm which was an AK47 and grenade and knife.  So it's clear Mr Chairman, that the actions of the applicants were indeed associated with certain political objectives and that of continuing the armed struggle on behalf of their organisation the PAC.\n\tMr Chairman, also that in terms of disclosure, Mr Chairman I think it's my submission that they have met the requirements of the Act and they have told the Committee actually what did take place there.  And also in the application as to what actually took place there.\n\tAlso if I may, the first applicant here who was the 2nd accused if I'm not mistaken, in the case, Oupa Lerato Khotle did not even in court hesitate to admit that we indeed committed the crime.  Though accused number 2 at that time wanted to take his chances that he may be acquitted.\n\tMr Chairman, having said that and also taking into account that the manner in which they did the operation it is clear that they only wanted money.  They manner that they did not hurt anybody there ...[intervention]",

So as I understand the reading of this, the prosecution excepted the fact that this was political.\n\tI may say one of the few cases that have come before us where the applicants had at their trial raised the political angle.

            "Well, thank you.\n\tIn the light of the attitude adopted, very correctly by the Evidence Leader, it appears to us that this is an application that should be granted.  \n\tThe applicants seek amnesty in respect of the robbery of a shop, the Pep Store in Botshabelo on the 17th of February 1992.  It is clear from the information placed before us that although one of the persons were armed, no violence was used against the people in the store and they requested money, the safe was opened and the money was handed over.  Thereafter the alarm was raised, the robbers fled.  There were three of them.  One of them was arrested by the police, the other went off on his own and thereafter the third robber who happened to be the one with the weapon was involved in a shoot-out with the police.  \n\tAlthough both the present applicants were charged with that, they were found not guilty at the trial.  Not surprisingly in the fact that one of them was already under arrest at the time and there is no evidence that they anticipated that the police would be present.  The evidence appears to have indicated that it was quite by chance that a vehicle in which there were policemen happened to be passing the vicinity at the time. \n\tIt is regretted that the shooting took place and as a result two policemen I think it was, two policemen died and the robber involved also died.  It was a proper shoot-out.  However that does not affect the present application which relates only to the robbery.\n\tThe evidence that the robbery was committed for the purpose of obtaining funds for the unit and APLA to continue their struggle has not been challenged, and on the evidence led at the criminal trial it appears that it could not be challenged.  This is one of the few cases where a political defence was raised at the trial and the Trial Judge accepted on the evidence before him, that they had been instructed to carry out this operation as members of APLA.  It was also commented on by the Trial Judge, that the evidence of the investigating officer was that the second accused, the first applicant, had co-operated with the police and he very fairly confirmed that to us today, that there had been co-operation.  And in those circumstances there appears to be no doubt whatsoever that the act was committed during the course of the political struggle of the past, that the objective was to assist the political organisation of which they were members, that there was no motive of private gain on their part.  The money was to be used by the unit, it was to be held by the unit commander.  \n\tWe are also satisfied, and it has not been challenged in any way, that they have made a full and frank disclosure to us.  They have been truthful.  And in those circumstances they have complied with all the relevant provisions of the Act and are entitled to amnesty.  That is amnesty in respect of the: Robbery of the Pep Store in Botshabelo on the 17th of February 1992.\nAPPLICANTS ENTITLED TO AMNESTY IN RESPECT OF\nROBBERY OF PEP STORES IN BOTSHABELO ON THE 17TH OF FEBRUARY 1992",
