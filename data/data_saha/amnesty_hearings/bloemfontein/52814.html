<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">JACOBUS JOHANNES DE RU:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a>	I am an applicant, Jacobus Johannes de Ru and according to the bundle page 1, my application is in front of you.  At present I am in prison in the Green Point in Vereeniging.  I was a member of the South African Police and specifically the Detective Unit in Sasolburg where I was a Captain.  I did twenty years of service and my force number was 00693260 and I'm asking you amnesty for three charges of murder.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a>	I refer you to the second bundle, page 1, where you will find the charge sheet as it was put out by the High Supreme Court and you will see it there.  I do not know whether you want me to read this out loud?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is the second bundle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> It's that one there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That's an affidavit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.  Would you like me to read it out loud or is it not necessary?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a>	I confirm the contents on page 1.  Your Honour, the date on which this took place was 1992, April 7th and it took place at Sentra Hypersave, that's a business complex in Vaalpark, Sasolburg in the Free state.  Your Honour, what happened there, like I've said before, I was a commander of the Detective Branch at Sasolburg.  Round about December 1991 and January 1992 an informant came to talk to me with regards to certain illegal diamond transactions.  Because of the fact that we did not deal with these kind of matters I contacted the Gold and Diamond Branch in Randburg in order to be of assistance to us.  She was helped by them and I accepted that she was happy with the course of events which happened afterwards.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a>	It was round about two months later that she contacted me again and then told me that she was not happy with the way the specific unit handle things because she did not receive any reparation.  She also gave me information with regards to illegal firearm transactions.  I contacted the Gold and Diamond Branch in Welcome to help her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Sorry Mr de Ru, who is she?  Who is the person you are referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Mrs Elsa de Lange.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Did you know her before?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> I only met her that day, December when she arrived at my office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Did you know where she worked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> As far as I know she was unemployed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Alright,  Continue?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Thank you.  Your honour, she informed me that certain gang members as mentioned were involved in the illegal distribution and buying of firearms, amongst others, AK guns, hand grenades, explosives and I told her that I'd try to use the firearm units to help her.  As far as I know she was also informed by the Gold and Diamond Branch to deal with the firearms unit in Eikenhof.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a>	Round about the last week of March 1992 Mrs de Lange came to me again and asked me if I could not help her to infiltrate the so called gang.  She also explained to me it was very dangerous for her as a woman to go and do this questioning because all of this happened in the Black areas.	Detective Sergeant Chris Fouche, I introduced him to her and Fouche was a member of the Detective Branch in Sasolburg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Just before you come to that, did you question De Lange as to her association with these people, who those people were that she was telling you about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> I'll get to the point.  At that stage she did not tell me exactly who they were, she only mentioned the gang.  Sergeant Fouche then started working together with her.  The reason why I used Sergeant Fouche was because in September the previous year he only started working at the Detective Branch in Sasolburg and then he was unknown with the Black areas in the Vaal Triangle and nobody would have known that he was a police member.  The rest of my unit was well known in the Vaal Triangle, specifically the Black areas that is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a>	All the information which I found afterwards was coming from Fouche and also from De Lange and on certain occasions a Black man with the name of Joseph who worked with Fouche.  De Lange now acted as Fouche's informant and like I've already told you all the information afterwards was reported to me by the two of them.  I trusted Fouche, he informed me that he was taken to the gang and he was introduced as her brother with the name of Brown.  Sergeant Fouche reported back to me but most of these people were trained M.K. members and this issue was also confirmed by Elsa and once again I'd like to assure you that I trusted the information they gave me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a>	On a certain day Fouche brought me a 635 Baby Brown Pistol as well as a 12 cartridge shotgun and these were weapons which he bought from these members of the gang.    Your honour these weapons, I tried to find the owners by asking questions at the National Weapon Register.  The 635 mm was not stolen, it was licensed under the name of Mr Elderley and was the same with the shotgun, it was not registered but I would like to tell you that the series number on the shotgun was removed and another number was engraved on this - M992.  It was known to me that it was similar to which the Municipal  Component of the Police in Sebokeng marked their weapons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a>	Fouche assured me that the weapons were bought with his own money.  They also told me that AK47 weapons were available and we had to try and refund him from state funds.  Fouche a day or two later arrived at the office with a red coloured Toyota Corolla vehicle.  This vehicle, allegedly he also got this from the so called gang members.  He went and placed the vehicle on the computer.  It was indicated that this vehicle was robbed on the 23rd March in Heidelberg, Transvaal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a>	Fouche also informed me that the gang did not only accept him as a member of the gang but he also believed that he was De Lange's brother but he did not take his appointment or weapon with him.  I was very concerned about Fouche's safety.  De Lange also then came out with a lot of other information regarding the smuggling of AK47 weapons.  My district detective officer, Swanepoel, I kept him informed about all this information which was available to me.  I also told him of the weapons which we already received by then and I was not going to go and look for the owners of the weapons because they were not reported as stolen and I thought that these people might be involved with the smuggling of the weapons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a>I also told him about the red Corolla and I told him that the gang worked with this car everyday and that was there reason why we did not take possession of this car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a>	One morning Elsa de Lange contacted me when I was at office and asked me to come and speak to her at her home.  Fouche accompanied me to her house.  It was in Danie Theron Street in Sasolburg.  There De Lange showed me a 765 Walter pistol and handed it over to me which she got for her own protection from one of the gang members.  I determined that this weapon was taken in an armed robbery where the weapon was stolen in kwaGuqa.  Fouche a day or two later came to me and asked me if he could take back the 765 pistol because the gang members were asking after it.  I gave him the pistol.  De Lange also gave me several other pieces of information with regards to this gang, mostly concerning weapon smuggling and armed robberies.  They also informed me that they take these weapons to Lesotho where they exchange it for diamonds and then they buy more weapons with these diamonds thus it was quite clear to me, you honour, that there was no financial gain with regards to this but it was only concerned with the distribution of firearms.  At a certain incident Fouche also told me that in the Black area of Zonkezizwe in Heidelberg they cannot just go in there but would have to give certain indications by using the lights of the vehicle or certain signs to show that there was a great amount of weapons, mainly AK47's, available within that specific Black area and that these weapons are used in order to cause political violence within the townships and also in order to arm the self defending units.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a>	He and Elsa, at several occasions, they had to fire with these AK47's in the Black townships in order to stay in the favour of these people.  The impression I got was that they basically just fired these weapons, they didn't fire at anybody, they just fired them.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a>	On the 3rd April Fouche informed me that the people wanted to commit an armed robbery in Sebokeng.  Members of my unit and also of murder and robbery in Vanderbijlpark and also of the security branch in Vereenging, all of these people I brought together at the old Golden Highway close to Everton where we wanted to stop these people and arrest them.  This action continued right through the day and it was unsuccessful.  Fouche came back and said that they might want to go and rob a certain place but this also did not happen.  Nothing came of it.  Fouche asked me, that he was looking for the 635 pistol because the gang wants this weapon back.  He went to my office at Sasolburg where I agreed with him that if he arrived there he must contact me.  I spoke to him and I was worried because if he's going to hand this weapon over because there was a planned robbery according to the information he gave me.  He assured me that he would damage this weapon in order ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why were you concerned Mr de Ru?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Your honour, because I did not want people to be shot with a weapon that was in our possession.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But the way I understand is that they had various AK47 rifles with them, they were in the business to sell weapons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> That is correct your honour.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And a small 635 pistol is not very important.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes but the impression that I got was that they were looking for this weapon to use this as part of the robbery.  He assured me that he will damage this weapon in order for it not to be able to be fired.  Nothing came from this, this information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Can I just ask you - do you know how he damaged this rifle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> No I do not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Do you know if he knew how to do it?  Did you ask him if he knows?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> No I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> He was a sergeant and you did not know him for very long, you knew him only for six months?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes but he worked at Sasolburg for the Police for a very long time.  He worked from '85 when I arrived there so I knew about him a long time before.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But did you not say that you decided to use Sergeant Fouche because he was not well known in Sasolburg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> I would just like to rectify that.  He was not well known as a Detective in the Black areas.  He worked in the Police garages so he was not a person that appeared in the Black areas at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So he was a technical officer at the Police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes that is correct.  He repaired vehicles.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> He never went out on any investigations then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Not before he started working for me, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a>	Your honour, on the 6th Fouche again came to me.  It was approximately seven o'clock that night and he gave me information that the people would want to commit an armed robbery at the Hypersave Business Complex at Vaalpark and that he must accompany them.  He also said that they will rob the place at 5 o'clock the morning of the 7th.  I conveyed this information to my District Commander, Swanepoel.  Fouche also told me that he will use a vehicle, that they would steal that evening.  It would be a Honda Ballade.  However, later that evening he would come back to me to tell me if a vehicle was found.  At approximately nine o'clock I brought all the detectives together in my office who were on duty as well as Warrant Officer in charge of the dog unit, as well as members of the Internal Units who worked in Sasolburg at that stage and then I informed them regarding the information that we received.  All of us then planned how to act.  We were concerned about the safety of Fouche.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a>	From my office we went to the scene where we looked at the scene.  Because of the location it was very difficult to determine what would - it was in a neighbourhood which was known to me to be very dangerous or it would be dangerous for the people or that these people would be dangerous and that they have got various firearms and also access to a wide variety of firearms and I also knew at that stage that they were involved in attacks and murders of six policemen.  According to the information that Fouche conveyed to me, the last of these policemen were shot the Friday evening the 3rd April.  According to him one policeman was shot and killed and one was just injured.  This information I checked up on and it was confirmed that there was such an incident but that one policeman was seriously injured and one not as seriously injured.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Just before this planning were you satisfied at that stage as to which organisation these people belonged?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes I knew that they were trained M.K. members.  Fouche also told me that they were active in politics and that they talked about politics a lot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> What did you make out of the fact that as much as they were political activists they were involved in criminal activities?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> As I've already said it was clear that these people were not trying to enrich themselves.  It was merely about the collection of weapons and the distribution of it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> And therefore what were you planning to do with it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Your honour, the whole planning was that these people had to be arrested.  It was also the main purpose why I got Fouche to infiltrate them in order to get as much information about them as possible.  I would also like to mention that before this incident of the evening of the 6th we asked the Security Branch in Sasolburg, asked them for money in order to buy weapons but they could not provide us and then we decided to go to Eikenhof to approach them in order to help us.  They were contacted and came to my office to help us.  In the office it was myself, Sergeant Fouche and Lieutenant Botha of the Security Branch in Vereeniging.  Sergeant Fouche told me that during one evening in Heidelberg where they looked at weapons once again, a police official came and sold weapons to these people or wanted to buy from them and the impression that he got is that the Police and these members smuggle weapons together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a>	When the Eikenhof people stopped and got out of their vehicles, Fouche identified one of the people as one of them who on the previous evening was there at Heidelberg concerning these weapon transactions and he was very worried that he would now be identified.  I realised that the situation now that Fouche's life is now in danger.  I told him to get into a cupboard in my office in order for him to hide there and then I told Warrant Officer Swanepoel of Eikenhof that we cannot continue with these actions because the informant has not yet arrived.  It was merely done because I was now aware that some of these members could possibly be involved in the smuggling of weapons.  At that stage I also had knowledge that various shotguns were gone or were stolen from the Sebokeng Municipal Police which had similar markings or was engraved in a similar fashion as the one that I knew of.  Botha confirmed that the suspect worked with them at that stage and was regularly seen with the people from Eikenhof.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Could you just explain that please?  Botha told you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> That the suspect that we thought stole the weapons or sold to the Municipal Police was seen regularly with the Eikenhof people and that they worked with the tracking down unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> When did Botha say that to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> That same day when the Eikenhof people were identified.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did he name the person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a>	Your honour, I would just like to mention I did the 3 Million investigation or so called 3 Million investigation in Kroonstad.  The reason why I'm saying this is that the political motive around which I saw these people, the 3 Millions were ANC Youth League people who acted alone with the ANC people in the townships.  There was also talk or information in front of this Commission about Police involvement concerning these acts and you also already found that it was politically motivated and that there was Police involvement and you have already granted amnesty to various members of these 3 Million gang.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a>	I also did an investigation after that at Tumahole neighbourhood in Parys where the so called Noxi gang was involved, that was already put to you at various other opportunities and various of those applicants were granted amnesty and it was also politically motivated and allegations were made that the Police was also involved in the provision of firearms to these people.  What I would like to mention to you now is that the modus operandi of this specific gang was similar to that of the 3 Million and the Noxi gangs.  There was also Police involvement, there was also talk of weapons that was given to Inkatha members or supplied to Inkatha members.  That's exactly what happened at the 3 Million affair and it was never argued and I accept it that the leader of the 3 Million gang was a cardholder and he came to my office or they came to my office in order to get bail for some of the members.  You will see that according to the modus operandi of these specific people it was similar to the 3 Million and Noxi gangs and I believed that these people were politically active through their acts and the arming of the groups to disrupt the government.	To come back to the happenings of that evening ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Sorry Mr de Ru, my knowledge about the 3 Million gang is not first hand knowledge it is only through documents that I received this information.  Why are you saying that this gang is similar to this gang that you are concerning in your application.  Were they not busy with murder and robberies, that they also got weapons and exchanged or got diamonds in order to get weapons?  How was it similar?</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> For the reason that they were also armed and that the Police were involved, that murder was committed, there was arson and the damaging of property and that there were robberies.  It was similar - in this case there were diamonds involved but it was also involved in the collection of more firearms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Where did you give evidence of murder where these people were involved?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Where I've mentioned that six policemen were killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> In your evidence that there was an incident where one person was seriously injured and another one lightly injured, that's the only one that we know of.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> That's the only one that I knew of that Friday evening, the others were just information that I got from Fouche that people were killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But your first hand knowledge about the activities of these gangs is zero because you do not know about the activities, you do not even know if they were involved in this incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> I only said that the information or the knowledge I had was from Fouche and De Lange.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So you're saying all the knowledge that you had about this gang you received from De Lange and Fouche and what you try to confirm was an allegation about the death of a policeman on the 3rd April and you found out that he was not killed but that there was an incident and you do not know if there was any connection?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> That is correct, yes.  You honour, after we did the planning we went back to the office.  We then decided that these people will be arrested.  I would make an arrangement with Fourie that if the vehicle arrived at the scene, that in case there's a shooting that Fouche will not be injured or killed.  I also told the people to be in my office the next morning at three o'clock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I'm sorry, I'm going to take you back now.  You didn't say when you confirmed that incident that would have happened on the 3rd April.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> It was the 6th.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> On the 6th.  You never said at any stage that you approached Fouche to tell him that the information that he gave you is wrong that a policeman was not killed.  You thought it was good, it was alright that he said that this policeman was killed, you find out that there was an incident but you did not go back to Fouche?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> No, I did not say to him that a man was killed, I've got no reason for not saying it to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You see, it is about what you understood how this gang worked, you're saying that this gang worked like the 3 Million gang and the one in Parys, that they had political motives and they killed people left right and centre.  You now thought that this gang is acting in a similar way and the only way in which you can confirm it is that you then in the end found out that Fouche did not give you the right information.  You do not confront him but you still accept that this gang acted as the 3 Million gang.  Would you just like to bring that together please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> I will, yes.  I believed that the moment when we catch these people and the investigation that would follow will reveal the truth and I believed that the information that Fouche gave me is correct and is the truth.  Today I know it is not true concerning the information that Fouche gave me and I believe that it will become clear to you when I continue with my evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You've said before that - and I'm reading this in English</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a>"I believed that every person who committed such acts on aged person belonged to a political organisation"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a>Can you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Could you please read it again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> "I believed that every person who committed such acts, that is attacks of violence and robberies, belonged to a political organisation and that they were instructed to do so."</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Chairperson, I think you're referring to the previous application.  Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You said that everybody who attacked old people did it for political reasons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> That was with regard to the farm attacks and that is my previous application.   I'm now only speaking about the Fouche incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Sorry to interrupt you.  Can you tell the Committee again what investigation did you do with relation to that red Corolla vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> As I've already said investigation was conducted on the Police computers, that was the investigation we led.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> And what were your findings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> That it was stolen in Heidelberg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Okay, continue?</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Sorry Mr Madasa, is the logical question now not what did you do about it once you found out that it was stolen and it was reported?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> This was part of the actions against these people.  Information was gathered against them and this vehicle was already in our possession and Fouche used this vehicle.  Fouche and De Lange, they used this at several occasions and they used it as mode of transport and they used it to go to the townships to go and speak to these people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> The question is why did you not immediately arrest because you had the Nexus, Fouche got the vehicle from the gang, this was stolen in Heidelberg, what more did you need in order to arrest them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> As I've already told you the gang was infiltrated for quite a while and we were on our way of bringing a very strong case against them and at that stage when the vehicle was given there were only two weapons.  We did not receive any AK47s or no AK47s appeared.  That's why Fouche continued with this infiltration and the gathering of evidence against these people.  I would also like to tell you that an AK47 was bought from this gang.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> On which day did the vehicle arrive?</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> The 1st April, your honour.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you did not want to arrest them on that day but on the 7th, that's when you wanted to arrest the two of them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Chairperson, you must remember it was only Fouche who arrived there with a vehicle, there were no gang members with them.  He arrived there on his own, there were no members accompanying him, he was on his own.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And he could drive it back, a bug or listening device, you could have used that not true?</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You do have things like this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes it was used on the 3rd, we tried to attempt to arrest them with that robbery on the 3rd and you'll hear further from the evidence it was also used on the 7th, this listening device.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a>	Chairperson to continue, Fouche arrived that evening or that night at my place and he gave me the information that these people robbed a yellow Toyota Cressida or stole one.  He provided me with the registration number of this vehicle.  I made an enquiry by phone with regards to this vehicle and then it came through as negative.  I asked the police officer in the radio room to do it again later in order to determine whether this vehicle was in fact stolen.  Fouche brought me under the impression that these gang members robbed the vehicle, he was not involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I just want to get clarity on this please.  Sometimes you use the idea of "Fouche told me" but then sometimes you also say "Fouche brought me under the impression" or "I got the impression".  Do you want to make a distinction there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So every time you say "impression" we must interpret it as "Fouche told me"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Because you're using it indiscriminately.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> I accompanied Fouche to the scene and that is Hypersave and like we'd planned the night before together with a group of people who were present with us there I told him where to park the car and that he must get out of the car on his own, by himself and that he must go round the left corner of the shop or rather the right hand corner of this shopping centre and that a back up group was placed at the flats where he had to go to and then we would act in order to arrest the occupants of the car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a>	In the second bundle you'll see a map from page 19 to 21 and I would just like to explain this to you.  Page 19, it's a map of Sasolburg and Vaalpark.  I do not know if the map is coloured or whether it is black and white.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Madasa what is it that we should be looking at here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> This is a sketch plan where this incident should have happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I'm sorry I didn't hear what you said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> This is a sketch plan of the area where the incident happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr Madasa I wonder whether you shouldn't try to lead or direct your client a little more to be more specific?  Do you know what the relevance is of him showing this plan of the area to us in connection with the application, why he has to do this in oral evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> So that the Committee has a full picture of the place from the photos and from the sketch, unless the Committee finds that unnecessary.  We can leave that out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I fail to see the importance of the area on the sketch in terms of an application.  I would be very pleased if you will ask your client or lead him to give us the evidence specific to what is necessary in terms of his application.  We have a full affidavit here, he's been busy now for the best part of an hour, almost an hour.  He's dealt with seven paragraphs of his affidavit.  I'm really not sure that we're on the right course, if we're going to handle the matter on this basis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Thank you Mr Chair.  Mr de Ru, just tell the Committee if you had other members who were part of the plan and why did you post them in regard to this area which was to be robbed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> The arrest of these people was planned by myself and then it meant that an arrest group was set out and back up groups were placed around the shops.  There were also back up groups of all the roads giving access to this shopping centre or away from them, back up groups were placed in these roads in order to stop them if they wanted to escape.  There was a back up group with two members, was placed at the garage, about six hundred metres away from the shop and a listening device was placed in the jacket of Fouche because at previous occasions we had problems with listening device, the fact that it did not record or it did not work, I agreed with Fouche that he'd stop right opposite this garage where the two other members were placed and that there he would give us a specific sign, identifiable sign that is, by taking off his jacket and to put it in the boot of the car.  That would have been the sign indicating that the robbery was going to take place and that the members were armed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a>	Fouche understood these instructions.  He gave me the names of the people who would be present.  He also told me that Mrs De Lange would come in the red Toyota and she'd wait at the Tygerbos Fountain and it would be used as a so called getaway car.  Fouche arrived at the office quite late, about half past three.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Sorry, did you have information as to the firearms they were going to use on that particular day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Chairperson, the fact that they would have been armed and the confirmation of the fact that they would be armed and the continuation of the robbery would only be confirmed once Fouche gave the sign and we already knew from the experiences from the Friday that they did not commit the robbery as it was alleged they would.  That happened on the Friday so we needed the sign.  The purpose was that in case the robbery was not to continue that they would be followed by a vehicle, police vehicle and we would have withdrawn.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Sorry, did you say the Friday you've already seen that they did not adhere to their appointment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> I told you that on Friday they also would have committed a robbery but nothing happened, nothing came of it, we sat there the whole day, that robbery never took place on the Friday the 3rd.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Why do you use the idea of turning up for an appointment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Maybe I've put it wrong Chairperson, but the fact of the matter remains it did not take place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a>	At the office I once again gave the instructions very clearly to all the members who were involved, the back up groups as well as the arrest groups.  Everybody was armed, everybody knew exactly what the instructions were.  The purpose was to arrest these people because they were dangerous and because they could have been armed with dangerous weapons.  Because of that I told the people that if they fired at us we would fire back but that none of them was to fire unless I gave the shot first or gave them the instructions to fire.  I also would like to mention that when Fouche left us this listening device was functioning, it was tested about two, three hundred metres away from us we tested it and it was still functioning fine.  Then we went to the shopping centre and the backup groups went to their different positions, posts.  Me and another ten members took up positions on the roof of the shopping centre and I believe you have photos in front of you, your honour, you'd see that it's a roof.  It's on page 51 in the second bundle page 51, 52, 53, 54. </p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a>	Warrant Officer Harley contacted me and told me that the vehicle stopped right across from the garage and that Fouche gave the identifiable sign and that the vehicle is moving in the direction of the shop.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a>	Once again I asked him to give the registration number of the vehicle to people in the radio room to confirm that this vehicle was indeed a stolen vehicle and the vehicle then was confirmed by the police as being stolen the previous night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> When did you determine this?  After you've heard that Fouche had already stopped?</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes I would just like to tell you that before this evening I gave this registration number through to the radio room and then they said it was negative, but about two o'clock in the morning they phoned me and told me that it was positive so at that stage I already knew it but I still confirmed it with Harley that it was indeed positive and reported back me that this vehicle was identified as being stolen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So at two o'clock in the morning it was confirmed to you that it was stolen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Then Harley told you that Fouche gave the sign and then you'd tell him once again confirm whether this vehicle is stolen and he reports back to you that the vehicle is stolen?  Why did you do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> The reason why I did it Chairperson is because the South African Police 280 is a prescribed form where they write in the enquiries.  I did not know whether they exchanged the vehicle from the previous time Fouche came to me up to now, whether they might have taken the registration plates off or whatever the case might have been.  I only did it in order to confirm that this vehicle was in fact stolen and I wanted to reconfirm it.  It was also indicated on this and the SAP280 in the radio room as about ten to or five to five, it was identified that this vehicle was in fact stolen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I do not know if I understand that.  You're in the middle of a very big operation and you're deploying a lot of people and the aim is to arrest people and you have Fouche as part of the group, he's driving the vehicle, so none the less you go and ask Harley if Fouche gave the sign or not and then to once again confirm if the vehicle was stolen or not?  How does that fit into each other?</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> I wanted to make sure there was no other specific reason for that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But why did you want confirm that?  Fouche is in the car, he's driving it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So why did you want to make sure about this?  I'm sorry but I do not understand this, I'm trying to get into your head.</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> No, I see what you're trying to ask me, I can see what you are asking me, I did it that way, I did ask Harley afterwards to confirm it once again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a>	The vehicle - Sergeant Raademan who was part of the back up groups at the top block of flats then contacted me by radio and told me that the vehicle was in front of the shop.  He also told me that the vehicle was turning around and driving to the back of the shop.  He also told me that we must lie flat on the roof because he can see some of our people on the roof.  Then I asked that we should maintain silence on the radios and I told everybody on the roof to lie flat because the vehicle was coming towards us.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You say you saw this vehicle that evening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> I saw it at night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes the night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you say that Fouche said that it was stolen that night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you also said that Fouche said that he was not present when this happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And that's a lie?</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That he lied?</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But you the following morning saw the same vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes I saw the same vehicle but the fact that I said there that he told a lie, I only found that out later but when he gave me the information that he was not present, it seems that it was not the truth, that he was present with the robbery of this vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But you saw the vehicle, you established that it was stolen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> The first time not, the second yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The second time you did establish that it was stolen and the next morning you see the same vehicle that you saw that evening at the scene?</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why do you ask again then, I don't understand it Mr de Ru.</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> I understand the problem that you've got.  I did not see the vehicle, I only saw it when it stopped at us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You said that you saw it at approximately midnight?</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes I did see it at midnight.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why would you then think it's a different vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Fouche's information that they would come with a Honda, they did not come with a Honda, they came with a Cressida.  You will see later in my statement that Colonel Swanepoel the next morning asked me it is not a Honda because I said they were coming with a Honda.</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr de Ru, what the Chairperson is saying to you is that you were aware of the fact that it was a yellow Cressida?</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You were aware of the fact that Fouche will stop with the yellow Cressida in front of the garage, would get out, take his jacket and put it in the boot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You get the message from the guard that you put out that the sign was given?</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You know from them that it is Fouche that stopped with the yellow Cressida so there's no reason for you to go and find out if it was stolen or not because already the information was given to you and it was confirmed that it was stolen.  Why once again go and ask if it was stolen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> The only reason I can give is with this 280 there was now official investigation and that this docket was opened.  I think it was submitted and is part of the documents.</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Let me ask it this way, I'm sorry to interrupt you, what's the difference if it was stolen at all because here people come to commit a robbery, you want to arrest them while committing this act, what's the difference if it was stolen or not stolen?  At that stage what has it got to do with the arrest?</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes it is probably true but for me it was important that it must be confirmed that it is the same vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> The vehicle stopped right underneath us.  We agreed with the member who stood on the right hand side of the roof that if Fouche moves past him he must throw a shock grenade, that was a sign that Fouche was safely past him and that would - or my intention was then that the people in the vehicle would then hand themselves over.  The member who was lying next to me had also a shock grenade and he would also throw it.  The shock grenade on the right hand side was thrown as well as the one on the left hand side.  Two explosions occurred shortly after each other.  Directly after these explosions shots were fired.  I realised that we are being attacked and the only place where these shots can come from is from the vehicle because there were no other people that could have fired.  There were no other people in that direction from where the shots came from except the people who were in the vehicle from right underneath us.</p>

<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...[inaudible]</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> It sounded as if it was directly underneath us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a>I realised that we were being attacked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Can you explain this to me - you hear shots and then you realised that you are being attacked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> I would like you to understand what happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Yes I want to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> We threw the shock grenades.  After that my whole planning was that we would tell these people that they must hand themselves over.  You must realise that we realised that they were dangerous people, that is why we also wanted Fouche to get out of the vehicle because we were scared that if we act with Fouche in the vehicle he could be killed.  If they shoot him or we shoot him, if the attack starts we realise at that stage that these people were involved in attacks on Police and it was no problem for them to kill.  When the shock grenades exploded, at that second I had no other idea but that we were being shot at.</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> That who was being shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> We, on the roof.  The vehicle was as far from us as from where Advocate Steenkamp is.  There are ten people with me and their lives are in danger.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You are on the roof so the vehicle is approximately 15 feet or more underneath you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> No.  If you look at the photograph, that is why I'm saying no, it was not that far from us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Look at page 48, photograph 2 from your bundle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes, I could possibly just say that you see the roof at the top there where it looks as if there's two figures on the roof?  It is not that roof, please page to page 51, can you see the part that looks like a corrugated iron roof?  We were there, then you will see that behind that there's another part of the roof so we were very close to this vehicle and there are colour photographs that were taken by the Police, I do not know if it's available.</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> We will look at it yes, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> So the vehicle was very close to us.  The people with me, their lives were in my hands, the situation was of such a nature that we had no other way but to act against these people.  I then fired the shot with my shotgun.  Immediately after that the people on the roof started to fire so with respect I believed that not just myself but the other people on the roof would have made the same conclusion that the shots came from the vehicle and that we were being shot at.  There was very short series of shots, in seconds, it's difficult to say.  I immediately said stop shooting.  Just after I said that someone reported to me that the left back door opened and that this person was trying to get underneath the car.  I was afraid that this person would throw a hand grenade on the roof.  I said to the person right opposite him to fire again and to shoot this person, the left back side of the vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You said that this person was trying to get underneath the car.  What did he do?  How can you say that he tried to get underneath the car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> The people who were on the other side of him or right at the top of him said that he was trying to get underneath the car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where was he found later?</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> In a bent down position.  If I can show you the photograph it seems as if he was wanting to get underneath the car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So he was not busy shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> I cannot say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You can say.  If he is trying to get underneath the car but you killed him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> There's no way in which I can say that he shot or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you think that you would be firing if he was trying to get underneath the car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> I believe or the way I saw it is that the reason why he was doing it was to get cover.</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So he can shoot up?  Just think a bit, Mr de Ru, it is not easy if he was underneath the car, he cannot shoot people on top of the roof?</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> But he could have thrown a hand grenade on the roof.</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If he is lying underneath the car he can throw a hand grenade?  No Mr de Ru, it cannot be.</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> No, you have to see my point.  I received a report that the door opened and that this man was trying to get underneath the car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> There's ten policemen and you couldn't wait and you had to shoot him immediately?</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes that is correct.  Yes we did shoot him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But you wanted to arrest him to find out what was happening to get information from him, but you did not try and arrest him, did you?  There were ten of you on the roof, there were other policemen round in the area and one man and ten of you shot him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes that is what happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes continue?</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> After I said that they must stop the shooting for the second time, I realised that they were shooting on the side of the shop, I enquired over the radio.  Sergeant Raademan said to me that they shot at a person who came around the side of the building with Fouche and after the explosion of the grenade, shot at us and they killed this person.  I asked two of the members on the roof to get down and to approach the vehicle to see if everything was safe but they did not want to climb down because of the danger.  I then asked Raademan to move towards the vehicle and to see if everything was safe.  We remained lying on the roof.  Fouche and Van der Merwe came around the corner.  I saw that Fouche was moving towards the right back side of the vehicle and he was moving in a crouched position.  I saw that he looked into the back right window of the vehicle.  I heard another shot being fired.  I saw that it was Fouche who was shooting and I gave him the instruction to stop.  We got down from the roof.  We secured the scene and I found that the two people in the vehicle were dead.  I also found that the person at the side of the shop was dead as well.  There was a fire weapon at the body of the person on the side of the shop, was a pistol, approximately two metres from the body and the person who sat at the back of the vehicle, also a weapon sticking out of the belt of his pants.  I contacted the service officer as well as Swanepoel who was the District Commander as well as the photographers, as well as the video unit.  During that period while we waited for them Constable Hammond and Raademan and Fouche asked me if they cannot go and get De Lange, to go and arrest her.  She was still waiting along the road at Taaibospruit.  They left.  Colonel Swanepoel, Captain Symington and the photographers arrived at the scene as well as the video unit.  Colonel Swanepoel took over the scene, photographs were taken and a video was also taken.</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Sorry, who called the video unit and Swanepoel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Say again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Who called them to the scene?</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> I cannot remember, I said that they must be called, I do not remember who specifically called them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But you said that they must be called?</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes I said that.  I cannot remember who specifically called them.  It could have been the radio room but it was under my instruction that it was done.</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Your evidence was, and that is how I wrote it down: "I contacted the service officer and Swanepoel and the video unit."  You cannot remember who you gave the instruction to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> I believe it would have been the radio room, that they would contact the people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Why did you ask for the photographers and the video unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> It is how it is done, that is how we do it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Is that standard practice?</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes, I would say it is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> At any crime investigation where there's problems you contact the photographers and the video unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes this matter was serious enough for me that I wanted them at the scene as well.  I was satisfied that they were coming.  You will not get a video unit for an ordinary crime or to take a video of it, for example in an ordinary robbery at a house you would not get the video unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But why the video unit because there's not action.  This is after what happened, three people died, no one's still shooting at you, you got the weapons, why did you ask for the video unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> I think it was just in terms of the thoroughness of the whole event, it was just to be thorough.</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So you wanted to cover yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes, we wanted to complete this investigation as fully as possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Sorry, did the arrest go as planned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Why do you say that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> I wanted to arrest these people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> What went wrong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> The fact that shots were fired, that resulted in the fact that we thought we were being attacked and I would just like to mention that in the meantime it came to light that I believe Mr Steenkamp could help us more if that some of this tracking down unit applied for amnesty and I'm saying this with an open mind that if those people were not killed that morning we would have prevented various murders if they were caught and arrested and investigation could go the way or follow the way as any other investigation would and that this whole matter were given the chance to be investigated.  You will also find in this bundle that where Eikenhof was implicated for the first time by a document that was sent by the security branch.  I was reprimanded because I said that there's a suspicion that Eikenhof was involved in this to such an extent that I had to write a letter and apologise that they were not involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did you write this letter before or after the incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> This letter was in answer to my reprimand that I received in an explanation that they were not involved in anything and I wrote this after they acted.  People were killed and this investigation could not be continued.</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr Madasa, I'm asking you please to lead your client.  Really he's now referring now to matters after the event which really is not relevant either to motive or to the act.  Please let us not deal with evidence from your client that is really not relevant to his own application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a>	May I just ask you Mr de Ru, you said that you only wanted to arrest the people and by a question by the Chairperson you said that things went wrong because when you heard the shots you thought you got attacked.  Just please explain to me, your information is here are people who are very heavily armed and in your head you are thinking that they might have AK47s at least.  Would you have expected that they would shoot?  You expected that this is going to be a shootout in some way or another?</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes we expected it, that's why our people were armed, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Now what I would like to know from you is how did you think you were going to arrest them?  Did you think if you threw two shock grenades they'll throw down their weapons, get up, put their hands in the air and say take me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> That's what I believed, I believed they would give themselves up.  It's not quite easily that when a shock grenade goes off that you are not frightened.  I believe that they would give themselves up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Do you not think that if they heard a shot or explosion they would not fire?</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> It's very difficult for me to say what their reaction would have been but I believed that they would give themselves up and the moment we made it clear to them that they were surrounded they'd give themselves up.  This is not normal police procedure where you go to a person and say we're arresting this person.  We wanted to create a shock effect on them and that's why we used the shock grenades so that they can realise that there's a very strong action taking place against them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You're you talking about AK's but what weapons did you find in the car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> A 765 pistol, two of them and a 38 revolver.</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where was it found?</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> The one 765 pistol was found with the person at the side of the shop about a metre and a half away from him but he was not in the vehicle and the 38 was found on the right side stuck inside his belt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Not in his hand?</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> No and the other person's weapon was found after he was taken out of the vehicle.  We found the weapon - he had an overall, a type of overall thing and the weapon was found in that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But not in his hand?</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> No not in his hand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And they only had two 765's and a 38, no AK47's nothing like that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> No, nothing like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And them came to do what, to rob this place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes to rob the shop.</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And they only had these small firearms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SOGODI:</span> Do you know when you threw these shock grenades what were these people doing?   Had they started to go into the shop or was it even before they went into the shop?</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> It was before they entered the shop.</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> They were still sitting inside the car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The doors were not opened yet?</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> No, they were still inside the vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SOGODI:</span> I mean as an experienced policeman did you - couldn't you even wait for them to start doing something before actually throwing the hand grenade and shocking them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> The instruction from Colonel Swanepoel was to arrest them before they actually got physically involved with the robbery because they were scared that people might be held hostage whilst this robbery was taking place or that they might shoot someone.  My instruction was specifically to arrest them before they commit the robbery.</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were there people there five o'clock in the morning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> At that stage there no people around.</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So there were no people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes, no people at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you knew this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> No usually shop opened at five o'clock but when they stopped there, there weren't any people around.</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, you got there first and you realised there were no people around?</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you could not have been scared that people might get injured if once they get outside the car because there weren't any people around?</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> No Chairperson, there weren't any people there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Did you recover any ammunition from the vehicle of the suspects?</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes there was ammunition found inside the car and there was also ammunition on the people themselves, on their persons.  9 mm bullets, 3 AK47 bullets, 765 mm bullets and inside the weapons there were also bullets, it was loaded and the 38 there were two shells which had been fired and two live rounds.  In the weapon of the person left at the back there was a bullet in the gun, it was cocked with a bullet in the barrel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Mr de Ru, the attempted arrest and the subsequent shooting on these people, how do you associate that with a political objective?</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Chairperson, it was quite evident to me that these people were activists who set out to disrupt the government of the day, to incite violence and I believe that an investigation would have led to this as well.  I acted by arresting these people.  Like I've explained before it then happened that these people were actually shot dead instead of being arrested.  At that stage it was known that there were several attacks on policemen and that several policemen were killed.  I would also like to refer you to instructions from head office which is attached to the documents about how one should act with regards to attacks on police force members and I believed that my actions were in line with the instructions I received.  My motive was to suppress these people and it happened that they got killed.  I saw them as the enemy of the state.</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> At that stage before the shooting did you have information if the gang was involved in the killings of police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> I did yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> What information did you have?</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> It was what Fouche told me, that they had already shot or killed six policemen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Did you believe that information?</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes I believed it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Did you find it necessary to investigate or did you take it on his word?</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> I took his word for it.  I believed his word, your honour.</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> You had some information that this gang could have been associated with the police, some police units, is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> What did you make of that, the fact that there were activists and probably associated with the police who were also employees of the state?</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> It looked to me like third force activities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Is there anything that you benefitted as a result of the shooting of these gang members?  Did you benefit anything personally?</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> No I didn't benefit.  I gained no personal benefit from it, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Were you satisfied about the information that you received from De Lange as to the extent the involvement of these members or their training in guerilla activities at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Chairperson, I learnt from De Lange that they were MK members, I did not learn anything about their training.  Now I know that De Lange was a trained MK but at that stage I did not know but I only heard afterwards that she herself was a trained MK member or probably still is, but at that stage I did not know that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> And now how do you feel about the fact that you killed those people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Chairperson, if I think back today, I really, really do regret it.  I'm very sorry about the fact that those people died that morning.  I realise completely that it was my shot that led to all these people being killed, my first shot and today it's easy because you can think back about it and say it's easy to say you acted wrongly and I'm asking you to see it in the light of what happened that morning and that's also why I came to you and ask you for amnesty.  I regret about those people who got killed and as I explained to Mr Malan, in my heart I believe that if those three people were not killed, if they were only arrested, I could have stopped a lot or murders.</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a>	I stopped the murders at Kroonstad once I started that investigation once I started that investigation and I arrested the people there.  One hundred and two people died there for nothing and today, honestly, I would like to say to the family of the deceased that I regret it and the fact that I gave the opening shot.  I also want to say to Elsa de Lange that I'm really sorry.  The person who died was her friend and at that stage she was a very good friend to her.  I would also like to tell her today that according to information I got from Fouche, she also had to be in the car that morning and then today she would also have been dead with regards to this.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> If you wanted to kill these members could you have done so before that day, if you wanted to kill them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.  It was never my intention that these people had to die, everything happened that morning with the suspicion of an attack.  I really have remorse in my heart about all of this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I just want to ask you a follow up question.  Mr Madasa you should maybe help us.  Your client is asking us to grant him amnesty on four charges which he lists again in paragraph 2 on page 1 of the bundle that you made available to us.  He applies specifically for amnesty on three charges of murder.  In order to achieve, to get amnesty, he needs to acknowledge specifically murder.  Are you happy that the evidence before us is a confession of murder?  All the evidence as I understand it, he's saying "I did my job, I did my duty, I did it as best I could, I'm not guilty of murder  There were certain mistakes made but I'm not accepting that I wilfully murdered three individuals"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Mr de Ru how do you involve yourself in the killing of these people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> As I've already explained, the two people in the vehicle died definitely because of the first shot that I fired and they died because of this action and the action of the members on the roof who then fired on them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But has your evidence, Mr de Ru, been that you fired in self defence, that they opened fire on you and you fired to save the lives of the ten policemen you were responsible for, is that not your case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Are you saying to us that if you were the judge in your case, would you have convicted yourself on three cases of murder?</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> It's very difficult to answer that, I gave a whole police dossier to you.  I know today that amongst others, Fouche is making other allegations concerning this and what his version of what happened.  I'm here to tell you exactly what happened there that morning, exactly what my instructions were.  If you look at the circumstances as it now seemed from the police investigation or from Fouche's allegations concerning this, I believe that in a criminal court it would be difficult for me to say now how a judge would feel about this matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Sorry, I may be unfair against your client but just to explain to him why I put the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a>	Mr de Ru, if a person is in jail he has been convicted of robbery and he applies for amnesty and he says that he did not commit this robbery, he cannot get amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes I do understand that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So you understand my question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> I understand it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Maybe this is a question for argument on the evidence before us at some later stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MADASA</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Right, cross-examination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Just a few questions to Mr de Ru.</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you going to ask questions before counsel appearing for the implicated parties?</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Mr Chairman, I'm here to represent the victims interests.  I'm in the hands of the Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Before I go on to that could I ask whether any evidence has been led on count 4?</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr de Ru, what is your explanation on the possible charge of defeating the ends of justice that you spoke to colleagues with a view to hide what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> That did not happen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> The question is that you apply for amnesty for amongst others the defeating the ends of justice.</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes I do understand that and I also understand that and I also understand what you asked me concerning the three murders.  Possibly it is a mistake to put all four charges here and it came from the state Attorney to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But Mr de Ru, with respect, the Attorney general could have charged with ten of which you were guilty of four and you can apply for four of that.  You could go to court and say that you are not guilty, so you have to decide and maybe you have to consult with your legal representative.  If the fourth charge - if you do not confirm or admit that, then you must take that out, then we cannot consider that or we will not look at that because you say that you are not guilty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> I understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I understand the difficulty in your position but you have to trust us if you apply for amnesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes I do understand that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Would you like to talk to your counsel at this stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We'll take a short adjournment.  It seems unlikely that anything much can be done before one o'clock.  It's now eight minutes to one, I propose to take the adjournment now till quarter to two.  Does quarter to two suit people?  I don't know what the arrangements are here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Mr Chairman, I think certain arrangements were made, I think it will suit us all if we can start at quarter to two.  Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We'll adjourn till quarter to two.</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a>HEARING ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">JACOBUS JOHANNES DE RU:</span> (s.u.o.)</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Yes, Mr Chair, I would like to make the following remarks.  Firstly I'm indebted to the Committee for allowing the adjournment. We've taken note of the questions that were raised by the Committee with regards to whether the applicant has admitted to murder or not and that those would be addressed in argument and secondly, on the fourth charge that appears in his affidavit, the applicant does not apply for amnesty for that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well I don't know if it officially part of his application.  If it is he withdraws it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> It's not part of his application in any case but he's not applying for amnesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you for clarifying that for us.  Right you can carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you, Mr Madasa.  You will argue later whether your client admits to murder or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes we'll argue whether the evidence that he has given is sufficient to be the basis for an admission to murder or competent verdicts thereof.</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Or any crimes for that matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> May I then just follow up with the applicant the issue of motive in order to see to what extent we can be of assistance and I accept your ....[inaudible] to argue on the ...[inaudible].   Who is taking up my microphone every time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a>	Mr de Ru I would like to ask you, would you then just explain in your own words what was the political motive for the committing of these murders?  I am asking this and I think that the legal representatives would have said to you that you can apply for amnesty for any crime for which there is a political motive in committing this offence.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> As I've already explained to you I believed that these people were trained MK members, they were ANC political activists and that their main purpose or goal was to arm themselves and others with the smuggling and trading of firearms in order to make the black neighbourhoods ungovernable in such a way that the Government of the day would be brought or forced to it's knees;  but the actions on that day did not have anything to do with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> On the day you wanted to arrest them for robbery?</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> No, it would be in terms of the whole investigation and the information that we received at that stage as well as what would follow out of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Can I then ask you, the Police had a lot of power in '93, why didn't you arrest them to investigate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> I could have done that yes but I felt that if we caught them in the act where everybody was together, it would have been easier to then get to the heart of the matter if we ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But in your own evidence to get everyone together it could have most been three because the driver of the vehicle would have been Fouche, your man?</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes.  I would like to mention that there was also another person who was not mentioned and who was not in the vehicle who later appeared and was attacked earlier on that evening and that is why he was not there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Your motive was initially to arrest them, you gave evidence that you did not want to kill them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But the offence for which you are applying amnesty for is for murder?</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And the murder came, if I understand you, was in that you fired a shot and thus giving a command and you said that it was a mistake?</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes that is true, it was the fact that I gave that warning shot that led to the people who were killed in the vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So at the stage when you fired that shot that lead to the death of the people there was no political motive to kill them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you.   Thank you Mr Madasa.  Sorry if you have any re-examination you're welcome to Mr Madasa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Not at this stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Although the representative of the TRC, the evidence leader, normally asks questions last I understand that Mr Steenkamp wants to ask questions on behalf of the victims and it was for that reason that he proposed asking his questions now.  Do either of you gentlemen have any objection to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> I have no objection.</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">MR JOUBERT:</span> I have no objection.</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR STEENKAMP:</span> Mr Chairman, Honourable Members, thank you for your indulgence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a>	Mr de Ru can I just mention it to you that my instruction from the victims is in this case that they oppose the application in that there was no political motive for your action or in your application, do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes I do understand that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Can I then just ask you, were you a member of any political organisation or party?</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> No, I was an employee of the state.</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Do I understand you correctly if you say that you had no political views?</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Except for the National Party and in the nature of my work we supported the Government of the day which was the National Party.</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Mr Chairman, I'm referring to page 1 of the big thick bundle, paragraph 7.  If you could look at paragraph 7, do you have it in front of you?  Page 1, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a>	I see that you say that it is not applicable.  Are you saying now that you were a supporter of the National Party?</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> I am saying for the government because I worked for them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Then to go back to your evidence in chief.  I would just like to ask you if you could just assist me if I'm wrong.  You said that Fouche said at one stage that the deceased were trained MK members and that it was confirmed by Mrs de Lange, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> If you can just go back to the bundle, page 254.  Have you got the page in front of you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Is also correct, before I ask you this question, if I would ask you the way in which I understand your evidence that Elsa de Lange knew these deceased very well and had close contact with them, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> If you look at paragraph 4, taking consideration what you just said I would like to read it to you</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a>"They never talked about politics to me.  According to my knowledge they were also not involved in any political activities.  At that stage I supported the ANC and I talked to them about it.  Joseph, one of the deceased, said to me that he will not get involved in politics.  It was also right throughout the attitude of the other two."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Can you see that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes I can.</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Do you differ with what she says?</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Because in your evidence in chief you said that she said that they were trained MK members.  Can you explain it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> No I cannot explain it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> If we look at page 253 Mr Chairman, it's page 253 of the bundle.   I'm sorry Mr Chairman, maybe we can start at page 252, just the previous page.</p>

<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> If I understand your evidence in chief you also said that Mr Fouche at various opportunities said to you that the deceased were trained MK members, is that correct?</p>

<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> If we look at his affidavit and if we look at paragraph 3, I would like to read it to you</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a>"The deceased were ANC supporters but I cannot say if they committed any political crimes.  They were crime orientated and that they wanted to get financial gain through these offences.  I cannot say that they were political activists."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a>Do you have any comment on that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> I do not agree with what he is saying here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Can you explain why both Mr Fouche and Mrs de Lange would lie in their affidavits?</p>

<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Then before I continue, can I ask you this?  You were in control of this operation, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Did you have a briefing with the members before the operation where you explained to them who the deceased were and what they were?</p>

<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Did you say to them that they were trained MK members?</p>

<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes as far as I can remember I did say that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> You see there's also a statement of Mr Engelbrecht on page 55.  This is a statement, Mr Chairman, of Joshua Engelbrecht and I'm specifically referring the Committee to page 57.  Do you see paragraph 9.1?  Mr Chairman, this is very badly photocopied, I do apologise for this.  It's paragraph 9.1.</p>

<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> And what catches my attention here is that not one of the members, including Mr Engelbrecht, in any of their affidavits mention that you would have said to them that these people are trained MK members and terrorists who were armed.  No one says that except yourself.  Why do you think that is so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> I cannot explain that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> If you could possibly just go and look, I do not want to waste your time, I would just like to refer you to the statements of the families involved in this incident and I would like to focus your attention on the statement of Mr P.J. Kabokoane.  Mr Chairman, this is on page 248.</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a>	Have you got that in front of you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Mr Chairman, specifically paragraph 5.  	You see the person who is making the statement is one of the deceased's brother, Mr Pako Johannes Kabokoane.  I would like to read paragraph 5 to you if you could just comment on that</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a>"I state categorically that my brother had nothing to do with politics.  He was not a member of any political organisation.  I am not aware of him having had any friends who were political activists."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a>What is your comment on that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> No, I cannot comment on that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Can you give an explanation why this person under oath would say something like this if it's not correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> No I cannot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Then I would like to refer you to page 244 Mr Chairman and specifically paragraph 8 on page 246, Mr Chairman.  Have you got the paragraph Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Can I just read it to you?</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a>"My family and the deceased were not political activists.  Neither I, my family or family members including the deceased belonged to any political party or organisation.  To the best of my knowledge the deceased's friends were also not involved in politics."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a>This person, independent of the other family say the same thing.  Can you give an explanation for that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> No I cannot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Can you give any reason why they would say this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> No I cannot comment on that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Then in conclusion, I would like to refer you to the statement ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, before you do, for the sake of the record perhaps we should record that that person was the deceased's uncle because it was his sister's son.</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, I'm indebted to you.  Mr Chairman, I would like to refer you to page 241 of the same record and specifically dealing with paragraph 3 and this is a statement by the mother, Mrs Mabosotho Johanna Makhanya.</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a>	Can you see paragraph 3, that is on page 241?</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> I'm reading paragraph 3 for you in the record.</p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a>MR DE RU</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a>"Neither the family nor the deceased or any of his friends were politically active.  The deceased did not belong to any political organisation, he did not participate or attend political gatherings or meetings.  I am quite sure about this."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a>Can you see that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes I can.</p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Have you got any comment on that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Once again, can you give an explanation why an independent member of the deceased would say something like this under oath?</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> No I cannot comment on that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Once again, I think for the sake of the record, it should be recorded that all these three passages appear in affidavits taken in November 1997.</p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Chairman then I would like to refer the Committee to page 229.   Have you got it in front of you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> This is a document that was drafted by the Attorney General of the Free state, dated 21 July 1994 and signed by him.  This is now in response to certain submissions or representations that was made by Mr De Ru the applicant to the then Minister of Justice and I would like to refer you to paragraph 4.2.  I would just like to read it to you. The relevance of this must be seen in the light of your own evidence in chief, I would like to read 4.2 to you for your comment</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a>"That although the deceased were members of a gang involved in illegal activities, there is no evidence that they had previously committed armed robberies and especially no evidence that they were involved in the killing of policemen two weeks prior to the incident as alleged by the accused."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a>Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> No, this is the state's information.  I cannot comment on this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Did you take any steps when you now found out that the deceased were MK members?  Did you contact anyone in the head office of the Security Branch or any police officer?  Did you inform anyone that these members of this group were trained MK terrorists.  Did you inform anyone about this fact?</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Just for the Security Branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> No, I'm talking specifically about the security branch, but I'm talking about any other police officer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Colonel Swanepoel who was the District Commander, Lieutenant Botha who was a member of the Security Branch in Vereeniging as well as - I think his rank was then Warrant Officer Coetzee of the Security Branch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> I would just like to get some clarity.  The question turns about the single fact that when you knew that these members were MK terrorists, did you convey this specific fact to them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes I did mention it to them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> And what was their reaction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> They never gave feedback that they confirmed that they were terrorists.</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Do you not find it strange?</p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> No it is not strange.</p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> You've got now three trained MK terrorists in your area, you contact your superiors and they do not come back to you and say we need more people or we have to sort this out with head office, this is out of our territory.  They do not even report back to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> No it was not strange to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Did you ever do anything to confirm the fact or with the information that you had that these members were trained MK soldiers, did you do anything to confirm this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> No, I believed what Fouche said to me and I did nothing about this.  I could possibly give clarity about this - I did not have the full details, Fouche did not say, he just gave me their first names and one name I can remember is Tyson, so I think it's very difficult to just on a name or an alias get any further information on that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Is there a reason why you never confirmed this or took steps to confirm it to make sure whether these people were really trained MK terrorists.</p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> No there's no specific reason.</p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> You cannot explain it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Except like I've told you all that I knew was this was their call names, they way they were called, I had no other particulars of them.  I didn't have their I.D. numbers, I did not have their full names, nothing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Did you ever try to find out who these people were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Chairman, I tried to find out from Fouche who these people actually were, he himself didn't know.  He didn't know their actual names.</p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Maybe I'm wrong and you must help me, but at least at two places in your evidence in chief you've said that the death of the deceased was in order  - or the goal of these people were to undermine the Government.</p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes that's how I saw it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> I do not really understand that, can you give us a bit more detail.  Why do you say that?  To what extent did they want to undermine the Government?</p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> It's because of the fact that they were gathering weapons, getting weapons together.  At that stage we all knew what was going on in the townships, we all knew that.  Political violence was committed in the townships and as I've already explained to you with regards to the investigation I held with the 3 million cases as well as the one in Parys, the modus operandi was similar.  I believed that these people were busy with exactly the same kind of affairs in order the further their political goals.</p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a><span class="speaker">STEENKAMP:</span> And what were their political goals?</p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> According to the information they were ANC trained terrorists.</p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But surely, Mr de Ru, if you only had their code names or their operational names, this made it essential to get in touch with the Security Police who specialised in the investigation of political matters as to whether they could assist you, by given you more details about these people whom you wanted to investigate, you wanted to arrest.  Why not do the normal procedure and ask the Security Branch for assistance?</p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> It's like you say but I still believed that the Security Branch would not have gotten anywhere with only the call names, the first names.</p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> I'm sorry Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a>	Mr de Ru, as far as that question's concerned, wasn't it the main function of the Security Branch to gather information concerning terrorists or about terrorists for the purposes of preventing anarchy and detrimental activities towards the state?  You know who these people were but you do not report back?</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> I don't think it's a question of that I haven't reported it, I already told Botha and Coetzee about it and if I remember correctly, the name of Tyson was known to Botha but like I've said, there was no further information forthcoming with regards to their identity and it was not available to us at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Can I just put it to you this way, maybe to make it a bit easier for you.  Did you have any information or any factual information which was of substance which would indicate that any of these deceased before, prior, was involved in any political acts or violence.  Did you have any information before this incident that they were involved in these types of actions, that they were involved in political actions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Political violence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Can you tell us a bit more?</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> I don't know if I'm going to answer you correctly now but at that time there wasn't something like political crimes and murder was a murder.  I'ts now that murder became political.  Arson was arson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> No, I think you misunderstand me.  Let's look at political violence.  You said the purpose of these people was to incite political violence, if I understand you correctly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes you do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> No, I'm asking you, did you have any information before this incident that these people were involved in political violence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> The fact that I was told that policemen were killed by them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Do you consider that political violence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you tell anybody you had reports and you had somebody who could identify the people who had killed those policemen, that they were trained MK soldiers and you had a witness who could identify them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes, my direct commander.</p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who?</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Colonel Swanepoel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you told Colonel Swanepoel that you had information about these trained MK cadres who had murdered the policemen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Around about the end of March or the beginning of April.  It's after I received the information about them.  I also reported this to Murder and Robbery in Vanderbijlpark.  After Fouche came and told me that on that Friday night they shot policemen and then they gave me feedback and told me that two policemen were in fact shot.  Like I've told you, the one was seriously injured and the one was lightly injured.</p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And did none of them ask you to identify these people, to point them out?  Murder and Robbery and Colonel Swanepoel, you told them you had information relating, which would identify the people who you thought had murdered policemen, in fact hadn't they merely tried or attempted to murder them, did none of them come back and say where are they, let's go and get them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> No Chairperson because they knew we were busy in arresting these people and we would have arrested them and I believed they waited for this to happen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr de Ru, you told us this was at the end of March?</p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why didn't you go and arrest them for the charge of attempted murder of police officers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> The attempted murder on the policemen happened on the 3rd March.  I only received information after it happened and it was confirmed on the 6th and on the 7th we tried to arrest them.  I'm talking about April, did I say March?  I'm sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I thought you said the end of March you were told when I asked you, you said that you told Colonel Swanepoel you had information about the trained MK cadres who had murdered the policemen, this was the end of March.  I thought that's what you said a few minutes ago.</p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Let me just correct that.  I told Swanepoel what the information was, the fact that they shot someone and that's when Swanepoel said it, but the confirmed case, that of the two policemen, was only confirmed to me on the 6th.  They were shot on the 3rd April and it was confirmed to me on the 6th and on the 7th we acted against them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What I can't understand is, you now had confirmed that they had shot at two policemen, a most serious offence.  Why don't you go and arrest them?  You had information as to where they would be found, you could have gone when Fouche went to pick them up and arrested them?  Why set up this massive thing with dozens of policemen in a public marketing centre when you could have the night before, when you ...[indistinct] the information, you could have gone and arrested them?  Why didn't you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> I believed that the best way was the way I did it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you serious in that, that you thought the best way was to wait somewhere the next morning in the expectation that they might drive up there and that your policemen who would have been with them might get a chance to get away and that they would then after you threw stun grenades come out with their hands up?  Is that what you believed was the best way, Mr de Ru?</p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> At that stage I did believe that Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a>	If you please turn to page 115?  Do you have it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line546"><a name="pos546"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Can you just tell us - what is this document?</p>
<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Your honour, this is a document which was drawn up by Warrant Officer Harley.</p>
<p class="line" id="line548"><a name="pos548"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> It's a Security Branch information piece, would you agree with me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> A Security Branch information memorandum.  Can you see it's marked "Top Secret"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> If you go to page 116, paragraph 15, do you see that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Please correct me if I'm wrong but it seems to me that this is a report from the information as it was existing at that time, do you agree with me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes, information which was available to Harley.</p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> And then in paragraph 15 it reads as follows, it's "Comment by Captain de Ru".  Do you see that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> You don't see anywhere there in no word whatsoever, no word indicates the fact that you had information which indicated to the fact that these people were trained MK terrorists and this is the Security Branches own report with comments by you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Here it was only with regard to the actions which took place, only to deal with the action itself which happened on Wednesday the 1st.</p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> The point I'm trying to make is, if you told Security Branch, one would have expected it to appear in here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> That was information which went from Fouche to them.  That was information that went from Fouche to Harley.  I'm talking specifically of Harley now.  This information about the Chinese person who was involved, I do not know where that information came from.  I also testified that around this report it was necessary for me to write this letter to Eikenhof with regards to the allegation in paragraph 14.</p>
<p class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> So you're saying this report is not correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> A lot of it is not correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Did you have an opportunity before today to read through this bundle and to read the statements of the people who I have quoted to you and to go through all these documents?  Did you have the opportunity?</p>
<p class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Chairperson, I provided these documents, the statements in the back I do not carry any knowledge of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line566"><a name="pos566"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Did you read the statements of Fouche and De Lange in this bundle, did you read through this information before today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Are you referring to the two statements right in the back?</p>
<p class="line" id="line568"><a name="pos568"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Yes, the ones I referred you to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line570"><a name="pos570"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> You didn't have an opportunity to read them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> No I did not.  The first time I became aware of this was when my advocate came to see me on Saturday, Saturday now past, two days ago.</p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> And then in conclusion I would just like to summarise by asking you this question.  You say that both De Lange and Fouche and the family members of the deceased - maybe I've just left something out, let me just give you the last quote.  I beg your indulgence for the last question.  Can we look at page 256, do you have it in front of you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> And correct me if I'm wrong, this is a statement of Deon Arons Sevenster, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes I see that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Is it correct if I say that Mr Sevenster at that stage was appointed to deal with certain cases in which you were involved, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes he had to investigate it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> He was part of the Special Investigation Team to investigate certain cases in which you were involved, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> If you look at the last paragraph of this statement then he refers to this specific incident, this is on page 256, right at the bottom.  There he refers specifically to this incident, can you see that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Now if you turn the page, paragraph 6, then I'd like to read it for you.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a>"At the investigation where I was involved, I came to the conclusion that the crimes were not political of nature but they were criminal acts."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a>Paragraph 7:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line585"><a name="pos585"></a>"If all these incidents were politically inspired it would have been investigated by the security police, that would have been the normal procedure."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line586"><a name="pos586"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> With regards to paragraph 6 Mr Chairperson, that's his opinion.  Here where I'm sitting here today, Mr Sevenster did not talk to me about the shooting at Vaalpark, nothing at all.  With regards to paragraph 7 it's also not true.  I did the investigations, I visited and did a lot of cases in the townships, I did the Noxi Gang cases in Parys and today realise it's political and it was not investigated by the security branch, it was investigated by the detective branch.  The security branch investigations, I cannot tell you what they would have or would not have done.  I cannot comment on that but with regards to paragraph 6 and 7, I do not agree with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Regarding the facts as I've put it to you, my last question to you is then - and once again please help me if I'm wrong, it would seem to me that all the people who are involved in this gang, Fouche, De Lange and the deceased families, at least five groups of people who knew the deceased very well, they all say that they were not politically active, you are the only person who says otherwise.  Can you give us an explanation why all these people would say that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line588"><a name="pos588"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> I cannot explain why they say that, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line589"><a name="pos589"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR STEENKAMP</p>
<p class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR COETZEE:</span> Mr Chairman, if I can proceed on behalf of Mr Fouche?</p>
<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a>	Mr de Ru, in the bundle in front of you, you read the statements of Mr Christian Jacobus Andries Fouche as it is contained in the bundle on page 152.  Further as well as page 252 and onwards, did you read the two statements of his? Have you read all these statements?</p>
<p class="line" id="line593"><a name="pos593"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes I have.</p>
<p class="line" id="line594"><a name="pos594"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> Now I want to put it to you and it's also my instruction on behalf of Mr Fouche, that the incidents as is put in the statements with regards to this specific incident and the run up to that incident, it's all described here, is not correct and what is contained there is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, that it's not correct and I specifically refer to the statement on page 152.</p>
<p class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a>	Mr Chairman, I'm not going to waste the Commission's time with lengthy cross-examination, I'm going to leave it there.  Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line596"><a name="pos596"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you going to subsequently ask us to accept Mr Fouche's version?</p>
<p class="line" id="line597"><a name="pos597"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> Mr Chairman you will note that Mr Fouche is not here as an applicant and my submission is that his evidence, as I am instructed, is in fact the truth and that he has given his version as to the best of his ability in the papers which are before the Commission, Chairperson, and he's not here Mr Chairman, to come and prove or disprove anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line598"><a name="pos598"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, I'm just asking you.  You don't have to go and cross-examine, it's not a trial or anything but I feel that it should be put to Mr de Ru that it appears on Mr Fouche's evidence that: "This was a planned killing by you, what is your comment?"</p>
<p class="line" id="line599"><a name="pos599"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It's right the way you said it, Chairperson.  From his statement it would seem the case, but it's not true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line600"><a name="pos600"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line601"><a name="pos601"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR COETZEE</p>
<p class="line" id="line602"><a name="pos602"></a><span class="speaker">MR JOUBERT:</span> I haven't got any questions, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line603"><a name="pos603"></a>NO QUESTIONS BY MR JOUBERT</p>
<p class="line" id="line604"><a name="pos604"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Re-examination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line605"><a name="pos605"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line606"><a name="pos606"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, I don't know whether Mr Steenkamp has any other questions in his other capacity, till now they appear to have been on behalf of the victims.</p>
<p class="line" id="line607"><a name="pos607"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, I don't have any other questions.  Thank you, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line608"><a name="pos608"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Very well.  Re-examination.</p>
<p class="line" id="line609"><a name="pos609"></a><span class="speaker">RE-EXAMINATION BY MR MADASA:</span> Thank you Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line610"><a name="pos610"></a>	Mr de Ru, you have said in your evidence that your actions were with a view to help the state at that time.  My question is if you are helping the state, why did the same state charge you?  What went wrong and tell the Committee what went wrong between you and the Police?  Why did they go after you instead of the gang?</p>
<p class="line" id="line611"><a name="pos611"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> It's very difficult to answer that, Chairperson.  I believe that the police in the investigation made the conclusion that murders were committed that morning specifically in the light of Fouche's statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line612"><a name="pos612"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> When you gave the sign at the scene of the shooting, when you gave the sign to the police, did you think the deceased were going to be killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line613"><a name="pos613"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Can you please repeat the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line614"><a name="pos614"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> When you gave the sign at the scene of the shooting to your colleagues, did you think that the victims were going to be killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line615"><a name="pos615"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Definitely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line616"><a name="pos616"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Mr Chair, with your permission, we're asking for a short adjournment of about five minutes.  We want to discuss whether it would be necessary to call Ms de Lange in support of the applicant otherwise I have no further re-examination.</p>
<p class="line" id="line617"><a name="pos617"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You have also - you will recollect ...[indistinct] applied for other witnesses to be subpoenaed and brought here today because you, as I understand it, indicated you wish to call them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line618"><a name="pos618"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> We'll consider all that Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line619"><a name="pos619"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> This has been a fairly considerable expense involved in that regard.  Very well we will adjourn for a few minutes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line620"><a name="pos620"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line621"><a name="pos621"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line622"><a name="pos622"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Mr Chairman there's one point I want to put on record on view of Mr Chair's remarks before we adjourned.  The witnesses who have been subpoenaed, have not been subpoenaed at our instance, were issued with a notice by the TRC in terms of which we were required to state the names of people whom we would implicate so that if necessary, on the TRC's part or investigation unit, those people would then be subpoenaed.  So we're merely complying with the notice which we were required to comply with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line623"><a name="pos623"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That is not what I had been told.  I had been told that you wished specific persons to be subpoenaed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line624"><a name="pos624"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> The people that we wanted we have subpoenaed, and one of them is Ms de Lange, but other people were implicated, it was purely a compliance to that notice which was issued.  Thank you Mr Chair, I have no further questions to the applicant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line625"><a name="pos625"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MADASA</p>
<p class="line" id="line626"><a name="pos626"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr de Ru, you said somewhere, I think it was in your affidavit in your application, that Joseph was known to you.  How was he known to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line627"><a name="pos627"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Chris brought him to my office, that's Chris Fouche, I saw him together with Chris Fouche.</p>
<p class="line" id="line628"><a name="pos628"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> When?</p>
<p class="line" id="line629"><a name="pos629"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> The exact day I cannot remember, it was after Chris infiltrated the group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line630"><a name="pos630"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And the time since infiltration up until the death that was about ten days, end of March until the 7th April?</p>
<p class="line" id="line631"><a name="pos631"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Yes it's about ten days.</p>
<p class="line" id="line632"><a name="pos632"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Why did he bring him to your office?</p>
<p class="line" id="line633"><a name="pos633"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Why did he bring him to my office?</p>
<p class="line" id="line634"><a name="pos634"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line635"><a name="pos635"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> He came to give me information and Joseph basically confirmed that this information was right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line636"><a name="pos636"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And Joseph was one of the MK trained men?</p>
<p class="line" id="line637"><a name="pos637"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> At that stage I did not know.  It wasn't even known to me that Elsa de Lange was an MK trained member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line638"><a name="pos638"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So how do you explain that, what was Fouche's motive to introduce one of these men to you as a trained MK member who wants to undermine the Government and who he has to infiltrate, now he brings him to you to give you information?</p>
<p class="line" id="line639"><a name="pos639"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> If I look at it today and I think back it's only one conclusion that I can make and that is that Fouche had his own agenda and I base it on the fact that the facts are now known to us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line640"><a name="pos640"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Yes but with what purpose?</p>
<p class="line" id="line641"><a name="pos641"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> It's very difficult for me to say, I cannot answer you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line642"><a name="pos642"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But you said he had his own agenda, then surely you mean he had something in mind?</p>
<p class="line" id="line643"><a name="pos643"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> That is what I'm insinuating, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line644"><a name="pos644"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But what did he have in mind?</p>
<p class="line" id="line645"><a name="pos645"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Chairperson I do not know, I made conclusions from the statements that I had available to me.  There was a fear that the people might not be arrested and allegations were also made against him of offences committed which he never reported to me.  Maybe he thought that if these people are arrested he'll be arrested too.  He did things which was not in line with his instructions that morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line646"><a name="pos646"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But Mr de Ru, he reports to you firstly that six policemen were killed and then later on you found out that it's not true but you do not confront him about that?  Then he also reports to you that a Corolla was stolen, thirdly that a Cressida was stolen.  He reports all these things to you in round about a time of a week, maybe less than a week, because this is already after he infiltrated the group.  Now you are saying that crimes were committed which he does not tell you about?  Which crimes are you referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line647"><a name="pos647"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> I do not know if I can answer this with regards to the statements I've seen of Elsa de Lange, I do not know if ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line648"><a name="pos648"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> No, you can take this into consideration because you are now talking about a suspicion that he had his own agenda.  Now please explain this agenda to us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line649"><a name="pos649"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Chairperson, if you look at Elsa's statement it would seem that Fouche planned the robbery that morning at the Hypersave and it was not the case that the gang gave him the information, do you understand?  He was involved with Joseph in the diamond transactions and he never told me this, and now Elsa is saying this in her affidavit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line650"><a name="pos650"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But did he not tell you that these people were stealing weapons, exchange it for diamonds and then they buy in new weapons with that money?</p>
<p class="line" id="line651"><a name="pos651"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> That is correct Chairperson, but you understand what I'm saying?  Now it seems that there were other transactions going down in order to gain financial benefit from it and he never told me about this, never.</p>
<p class="line" id="line652"><a name="pos652"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Which transactions are you referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line653"><a name="pos653"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> The fact that Elsa said that he went with Joseph to Lesotho and also in her statement she says that he told her that he killed her lover boy because he - sorry let me put this right - that Joseph cheated Chris in a diamond transaction.  These are things that I never knew about and the same goes with the robbery that morning, from Elsa's statement it would seem that he picked up Elsa and Joseph and he saw a person walking on the street and said I want to rob that guy because he's got money and with regards to the shopping centre the next morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line654"><a name="pos654"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But you say Elsa de Lange is here but you have decided not to call her as a witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line655"><a name="pos655"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> No, she is being called, Elsa is being called, she's here.  I think maybe the advocate maybe hasn't explained it yet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line656"><a name="pos656"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You then said that the shock grenades were thrown and detonated, then shots were fired?</p>
<p class="line" id="line657"><a name="pos657"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line658"><a name="pos658"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Then you gave the instruction to answer the fire because you are being attacked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line659"><a name="pos659"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line660"><a name="pos660"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> How do you explain the fact that the pistol that was found on the deceased in the vehicle was still in his belt?</p>
<p class="line" id="line661"><a name="pos661"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> I cannot explain that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line662"><a name="pos662"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So you do not know where the shots were fired from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line663"><a name="pos663"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> The only conclusion that I can make Mr Chairperson, is that the shots were fired from the vehicle because no one else could have shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line664"><a name="pos664"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Were any of those weapons - were shots fired by any of those weapons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line665"><a name="pos665"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> The whole matter was investigated.  I can mention that according to the ballistic report, the 38 revolver they found two shells and two live rounds but according to the ballistic personnel, the forensic evidence, they did not find any residue on the hands of the deceased.  Could I just clear up a point here?  	Once again Fouche states that I would have given him an instruction that directly after he picked up the people he must take the people to fire shots in order for them to have gunpowder residue on their hands and that is confirmed by the forensic personnel saying that they did not find any gunpowder residue.  That is what I do not understand, but now it is clear to me that the people in the vehicle did not fire, that the fire or the shots were fired from the side of the shop without any instructions.  That is why I am in front of you today.  	It seems now that my instruction to shoot the people in the vehicle was a mistake.  At that stage I thought that the shots could only come from one place and that is from the vehicle because they were the only people who could have shot because none of the other backup groups had the instruction to fire, no one else could have fired, not even the people on the roof.  There was a specific instruction given that no one will shoot unless I shoot first.</p>
<p class="line" id="line666"><a name="pos666"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> We have to get an impression of what you are saying to us and we have to find out what happened and if it fits in an amnesty application that you bring to us.  If I listen to you now and if I summarise it correctly, you are trying to say to us and that what you are thinking is that Fouche wanted to get rid of these three men and he wanted to frame you for it.  Is that what you are saying to us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line667"><a name="pos667"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> You can see it in that light.</p>
<p class="line" id="line668"><a name="pos668"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I'm asking you how you see it because you said he's got an agenda, and everything that you say to me is as if you are putting this story in front of us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line669"><a name="pos669"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> That is correct.  Fouche was a co-accused, the case was withdrawn against him in 1994 and he is now state witness.  That is what I'm trying to say to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line670"><a name="pos670"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But that does not bring us closer to the truth because we haven't got evidence concerning this.  I'm going to leave it there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line671"><a name="pos671"></a>	In conclusion I'd like to follow the following up.  You said that in order to succeed in your application for amnesty you must admit that you committed an offence and that this specific offence was committed with a specific political motive.  In your evidence you did not have an objective firstly, in order the killing is in an attempt to arrest them, things went wrong.  So the political objective, if you had one, would then be around the arrest.  But the arrest would not have been an offence because it is a legal arrest and that is the problem that we've got.  	</p>
<p class="line" id="line672"><a name="pos672"></a>	Concerning the facts that you present to us, I understand it and I see it as well, and I think that is why the advocates said that they would clear this up in their argument.  I would just like to say that from the Amnesty Committee's side that wherever they can, if they have to they will stretch towards the side of the applicant but there must be a basis for which we can do this, but I'm struggling to find it.  We will then wait for your witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line673"><a name="pos673"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line674"><a name="pos674"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Could I raise something arising from what you've just told my colleague, and that is that I understood your evidence and I may have been mistaken, that you heard the shots coming from below you, in front of you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line675"><a name="pos675"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line676"><a name="pos676"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now you have just said the shots could have come from the car, so you didn't hear them coming from in front and below you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line677"><a name="pos677"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Maybe you did not understand me correctly.  I heard the shots and my conclusion was the only place where they can come from is from the vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line678"><a name="pos678"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How could you come to that conclusion when you knew people had walked off to the right, who were presumably armed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line679"><a name="pos679"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> Your Honour, only one person had to walk to the right hand side and that is Fouche.</p>
<p class="line" id="line680"><a name="pos680"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But Joseph went with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line681"><a name="pos681"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> I did not carry any knowledge about that, it was not the instruction and I did not know about that.  He was supposed to go alone around the corner.</p>
<p class="line" id="line682"><a name="pos682"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So were none of you people watching what was going on below you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line683"><a name="pos683"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> It was impossible because then they would have immediately seen us on the roof.</p>
<p class="line" id="line684"><a name="pos684"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you just ordered "open fire" because you heard a shot coming from somewhere which you couldn't place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line685"><a name="pos685"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> As I explained it to you, my only conclusion was that it could have come from the vehicle in front.</p>
<p class="line" id="line686"><a name="pos686"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But you had no evidence to support that, it was merely a conclusion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line687"><a name="pos687"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> That is correct yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line688"><a name="pos688"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Oh, sorry you said you were calling the witness, what's her name, Mrs or Ms de Lange?</p>
<p class="line" id="line689"><a name="pos689"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE RU:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line690"><a name="pos690"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line691"><a name="pos691"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Thank you Mr Chair, I beg leave to call Elsa de Lange?</p>
<p class="line" id="line692"><a name="pos692"></a><span class="speaker">ELIZABETH DE LANGE:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line693"><a name="pos693"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR MADASA:</span> Thank you Mr Chair.</p>

<p class="line" id="line701"><a name="pos701"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> We were friends from 1983.</p>
<p class="line" id="line702"><a name="pos702"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Friends?  How?</p>
<p class="line" id="line703"><a name="pos703"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Through politics.</p>
<p class="line" id="line704"><a name="pos704"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Were you a member of the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line705"><a name="pos705"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Yes I'm a member of the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line706"><a name="pos706"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> And them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line707"><a name="pos707"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> They were members of the ANC too.</p>
<p class="line" id="line708"><a name="pos708"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Were you an MK member?</p>
<p class="line" id="line709"><a name="pos709"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Yes I'm a member of the MK.</p>
<p class="line" id="line710"><a name="pos710"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line711"><a name="pos711"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> They were members of MK.</p>
<p class="line" id="line712"><a name="pos712"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> When did you start to become an MK member, you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line713"><a name="pos713"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Me?  1983.  I was part of the ANC going around with those guys.</p>
<p class="line" id="line714"><a name="pos714"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> No, I mean MK.</p>
<p class="line" id="line715"><a name="pos715"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Yes, well the MK.</p>
<p class="line" id="line716"><a name="pos716"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> 19?</p>
<p class="line" id="line717"><a name="pos717"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> '83.</p>
<p class="line" id="line718"><a name="pos718"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> '83?  And the deceased, do you know when they joined the MK?</p>
<p class="line" id="line719"><a name="pos719"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> No I don't know.  I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line720"><a name="pos720"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> When did you become aware for the first time that they were also MK members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line721"><a name="pos721"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Because they used to go to Zone 13 with me, to those meetings of the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line722"><a name="pos722"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Did you later become aware that the deceased were MK members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line723"><a name="pos723"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Who?  Sorry?</p>
<p class="line" id="line724"><a name="pos724"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Did you later become aware that the deceased were MK members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line725"><a name="pos725"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> No, they were just going with me to those meetings so we realised that all of us we were MK members but we were not active MK members so they just go along with me to those meetings and let me put it this way, they were card carrying members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line726"><a name="pos726"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line727"><a name="pos727"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Card carrying members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line728"><a name="pos728"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Card carrying members of what, Ms de Lange?</p>
<p class="line" id="line729"><a name="pos729"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Of the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line730"><a name="pos730"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Not of the MK?</p>
<p class="line" id="line731"><a name="pos731"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> The MK is ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line732"><a name="pos732"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> No, card carrying members, ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line733"><a name="pos733"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Ja, ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line734"><a name="pos734"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did you see their cards?</p>
<p class="line" id="line735"><a name="pos735"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line736"><a name="pos736"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> All of them?  All of their membership cards?</p>
<p class="line" id="line737"><a name="pos737"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> No, not all of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line738"><a name="pos738"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So whose did you see?</p>
<p class="line" id="line739"><a name="pos739"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> I saw Joseph's card and Buthelezi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line740"><a name="pos740"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Ms de Lange were you an MK trained member?</p>
<p class="line" id="line741"><a name="pos741"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Yes I got my training.</p>
<p class="line" id="line742"><a name="pos742"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line743"><a name="pos743"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> I got training.</p>
<p class="line" id="line744"><a name="pos744"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Where were you trained?</p>
<p class="line" id="line745"><a name="pos745"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> In Sebokeng itself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line746"><a name="pos746"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Do you know if any of the deceased was trained as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line747"><a name="pos747"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> We were not guerilla trained people if you want to know that.  We don't train to go and make bombs or something like that, no.  But on reading, yes, they ask us - you know like ANC we just - sometimes we did discuss that there must be a new Government, we must be equal but not deep politics like going to go out and murder someone.  Never, we never discussed something like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line748"><a name="pos748"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Do you know if, amongst the deceased, anyone of them was trained MK as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line749"><a name="pos749"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Trained?  No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line750"><a name="pos750"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> On the 10th October 1997, I'm referring now to the bundle on page 255, 254 I'm sorry, 254 - you made a statement.  If you could look at the statement?  Look at paragraph 4 on page 254.</p>
<p class="line" id="line751"><a name="pos751"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Yes, I've got it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line752"><a name="pos752"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Can you explain that paragraph about training or non-training of yourself and the deceased, whether you spoke about politics?</p>
<p class="line" id="line753"><a name="pos753"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Yes, yes, I say here that I'm trained.</p>
<p class="line" id="line754"><a name="pos754"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> You say you were trained?</p>
<p class="line" id="line755"><a name="pos755"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Yes that is what I say there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line756"><a name="pos756"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> And then the deceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line757"><a name="pos757"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> No.  They do not get involved into  politics.</p>
<p class="line" id="line758"><a name="pos758"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> What do you mean by that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line759"><a name="pos759"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> That they were not involved in politics.</p>
<p class="line" id="line760"><a name="pos760"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> In what way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line761"><a name="pos761"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> They didn't go out to kill people because of politics and we didn't plant bombs or anything like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line762"><a name="pos762"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Okay, let me put it this way.  What were you involved in?  You have told us what you were not involved in, you were not involved in murder and killing people.  What were you involved in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line763"><a name="pos763"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> In Zone 13 we had to protect the ANC in Sebokeng because at that stage there was a lot of attacks of Inkatha on these people and that is what the whole operation was about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line764"><a name="pos764"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Were you involved in gun smuggling?</p>
<p class="line" id="line765"><a name="pos765"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> I would not say directly smuggling but we did have weapons available.</p>
<p class="line" id="line766"><a name="pos766"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Were you involved in distribution or buying of guns?</p>
<p class="line" id="line767"><a name="pos767"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Weapons were bought yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line768"><a name="pos768"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Where.</p>
<p class="line" id="line769"><a name="pos769"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> In Sebokeng.</p>
<p class="line" id="line770"><a name="pos770"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> From whom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line771"><a name="pos771"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Different people, they were never the same.</p>
<p class="line" id="line772"><a name="pos772"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> What quantity of weapons, did you buy a lot of weapons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line773"><a name="pos773"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> No, single ones.</p>
<p class="line" id="line774"><a name="pos774"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> What for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line775"><a name="pos775"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> It was not used, it was the weapons that we handed over to the police.  It was the weapons that we bought.</p>
<p class="line" id="line776"><a name="pos776"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> You bought weapons and supplied the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line777"><a name="pos777"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Yes.  We did not provide the police with weapons, whenever you hand in a weapon we would get remuneration for that and that is why we did it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line778"><a name="pos778"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Did you get those weapons from the ANC or IFP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line779"><a name="pos779"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> The most of the weapons we got from the IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line780"><a name="pos780"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> What kind of weapons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line781"><a name="pos781"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> 765, small shotguns, there were AK's as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line782"><a name="pos782"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> In doing so, were you disarming the IFP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line783"><a name="pos783"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Yes.  Single people who went into a certain neighbourhood and caused trouble, then the ANC youth would then catch that person and take his weapon from him and that is how we got these weapons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line784"><a name="pos784"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Was there a political war at that stage in the township between the IFP and ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line785"><a name="pos785"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Yes there was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line786"><a name="pos786"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Was there also third force activities?</p>
<p class="line" id="line787"><a name="pos787"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Not what I know of, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line788"><a name="pos788"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Do you know anything about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line789"><a name="pos789"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> No, nothing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line790"><a name="pos790"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> And now, in retrospect?</p>
<p class="line" id="line791"><a name="pos791"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> No not at all, I carry no knowledge of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line792"><a name="pos792"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Were you involved in diamond smuggling?</p>
<p class="line" id="line793"><a name="pos793"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> No, I did not smuggle diamonds myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line794"><a name="pos794"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> No, I don't mean you personally.  Did you know about it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line795"><a name="pos795"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Ja, I know about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line796"><a name="pos796"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Which involved the deceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line797"><a name="pos797"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Yes I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line798"><a name="pos798"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Who amongst the deceased were involved in that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line799"><a name="pos799"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Joseph.</p>
<p class="line" id="line800"><a name="pos800"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> And who else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line801"><a name="pos801"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> As far as I know only Joseph.</p>
<p class="line" id="line802"><a name="pos802"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Did you know Fouche?</p>
<p class="line" id="line803"><a name="pos803"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line804"><a name="pos804"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> How did you come to know him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line805"><a name="pos805"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> After he came to my house to go and buy the first weapons together with us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line806"><a name="pos806"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Did you know that he was a policeman before he came to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line807"><a name="pos807"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line808"><a name="pos808"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Did he then join you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line809"><a name="pos809"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line810"><a name="pos810"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Were the other members aware of that, that the policeman had joined you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line811"><a name="pos811"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Only Jospeh, Joseph was the only one that was aware.</p>
<p class="line" id="line812"><a name="pos812"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Joseph and yourself?  The others did not know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line813"><a name="pos813"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line814"><a name="pos814"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> You did not tell them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line815"><a name="pos815"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line816"><a name="pos816"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Did you tell them?  Did you tell other members that Fouche a policeman had joined?</p>
<p class="line" id="line817"><a name="pos817"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> No we didn't tell them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line818"><a name="pos818"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> You did not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line819"><a name="pos819"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> We didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line820"><a name="pos820"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Was he reliable?</p>
<p class="line" id="line821"><a name="pos821"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Ja, I think so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line822"><a name="pos822"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Did you trust him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line823"><a name="pos823"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> We trusted him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line824"><a name="pos824"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Now did you trust him up to the date of the shooting - Fouche?</p>
<p class="line" id="line825"><a name="pos825"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Yes right up until before the shooting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line826"><a name="pos826"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Why did you not go with them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line827"><a name="pos827"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Because from the beginning I said it was going to be a trap.  It's impossible, policemen planning a robbery cannot be true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line828"><a name="pos828"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> So you knew that on that day of the shooting the robbery was a trap?</p>
<p class="line" id="line829"><a name="pos829"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> I had a feeling it might be the case but I didn't have facts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line830"><a name="pos830"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Is that why you did not go with them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line831"><a name="pos831"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Yes I stayed at home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line832"><a name="pos832"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> So meaning that you did not trust Fouche?</p>
<p class="line" id="line833"><a name="pos833"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> No the robbery, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line834"><a name="pos834"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Why did you not believe that the robbery was genuine?</p>
<p class="line" id="line835"><a name="pos835"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> A policeman planning a robbery, I mean really, how would they achieve that?  It cannot be, it can't work.</p>
<p class="line" id="line836"><a name="pos836"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> But why did you allow him to be part of you because he was a policeman and you were MKs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line837"><a name="pos837"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> We wanted remuneration for the weapons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line838"><a name="pos838"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well has she said she was MK?  You said you were MK, she said she was a card carrying member of the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line839"><a name="pos839"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> She said she was a trained MK.</p>
<p class="line" id="line840"><a name="pos840"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The training she had was in discussions, she told us, not guerilla warfare.  Isn't MK training normally guerilla warfare, what we refer to as MK training in any event.</p>
<p class="line" id="line841"><a name="pos841"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Mr Chair, with due respect, that's not necessarily the case.  What she says she was a trained MK, we should take it at that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line842"><a name="pos842"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> She made it quite clear.  As I understand it, that you were not trained in the use of violence, your training consisted of political discussions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line843"><a name="pos843"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Ja.</p>
<p class="line" id="line844"><a name="pos844"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> What did Fouche say was the reason for the robbery?</p>
<p class="line" id="line845"><a name="pos845"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> That was a long weekend and there was supposed to be a lot of money in that shop.</p>
<p class="line" id="line846"><a name="pos846"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> What was the money for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line847"><a name="pos847"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> They were supposed to go away to South West and I think he talked about a divorce.</p>
<p class="line" id="line848"><a name="pos848"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> About?</p>
<p class="line" id="line849"><a name="pos849"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Divorce.</p>
<p class="line" id="line850"><a name="pos850"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> His divorce, so he needed money?</p>
<p class="line" id="line851"><a name="pos851"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line852"><a name="pos852"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> What about South West?</p>
<p class="line" id="line853"><a name="pos853"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> I wasn't sure, I only heard that they said they wanted to go there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line854"><a name="pos854"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Did you ever supply information to De Ru about your involvement, either yourself or the other members of the deceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line855"><a name="pos855"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line856"><a name="pos856"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Do you know if Fouche gave the applicant information about your activities?  You don't know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line857"><a name="pos857"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line858"><a name="pos858"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> What information did you give to De Ru about the deceased?  What did you tell him about the deceased, about your members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line859"><a name="pos859"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> At which stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line860"><a name="pos860"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> When you had contact with him, when you gave him information, what information did you give?</p>
<p class="line" id="line861"><a name="pos861"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Basically Joseph was present each time that I talked to De Ru.</p>
<p class="line" id="line862"><a name="pos862"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line863"><a name="pos863"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Joseph was present most of the times.</p>
<p class="line" id="line864"><a name="pos864"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> No,  that's not my question.  What did you tell him, De Ru?</p>
<p class="line" id="line865"><a name="pos865"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Ja, but that's why Joseph knew what kind of information I gave him about guns.</p>
<p class="line" id="line866"><a name="pos866"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> You gave De Ru information about guns?</p>
<p class="line" id="line867"><a name="pos867"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Ja.</p>
<p class="line" id="line868"><a name="pos868"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> What about guns?</p>
<p class="line" id="line869"><a name="pos869"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> About the certain guns we are going to bring in and that we need money, you can't just get those guns for free.</p>
<p class="line" id="line870"><a name="pos870"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Did you tell De Ru that you were MK members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line871"><a name="pos871"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> No, never.</p>
<p class="line" id="line872"><a name="pos872"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> What did you say you were to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line873"><a name="pos873"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> I don't think I ever said anything to him what I am because he never asked me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line874"><a name="pos874"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> On what basis were you dealing with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line875"><a name="pos875"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> At first I worked with him through Vosloo of the Diamond and Gold Branch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line876"><a name="pos876"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> You worked with De Ru?  With Fouche?</p>
<p class="line" id="line877"><a name="pos877"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> No, not directly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line878"><a name="pos878"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Did you supply information to the police about your members?</p>

<p class="line" id="line880"><a name="pos880"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> What did you do, did you give information to Fouche about your activities?</p>
<p class="line" id="line881"><a name="pos881"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Fouche was part of us so we didn't have to give him any information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line882"><a name="pos882"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Did you tell the applicant, De Ru, about your activities?</p>
<p class="line" id="line883"><a name="pos883"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> No, he never asked me about my...</p>
<p class="line" id="line884"><a name="pos884"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Did you ever talk to De Ru?</p>
<p class="line" id="line885"><a name="pos885"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Yes I spoke to De Ru.</p>
<p class="line" id="line886"><a name="pos886"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> About what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line887"><a name="pos887"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> When he asked me about some diamonds that I knew was in Everton, so he asked me to go and fetch them and he introduced me to a Sanna and one day we went to his house, together with Josesph.</p>
<p class="line" id="line888"><a name="pos888"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Sorry, he introduced you to who?</p>
<p class="line" id="line889"><a name="pos889"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Warrant Officer Vosloo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line890"><a name="pos890"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Did Vosloo tell you that he killed your lover boy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line891"><a name="pos891"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Ja, he did say that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line892"><a name="pos892"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Why did he tell you that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line893"><a name="pos893"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> That he killed my lover boy?</p>

<p class="line" id="line896"><a name="pos896"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> What was the story with your lover boy being killed by him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line897"><a name="pos897"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> I don't know what was the story, that's why I'm here today, I also want to know what's the story about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line898"><a name="pos898"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Do you know if Fouche had a problem with Joseph, cheated by him or something like that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line899"><a name="pos899"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line900"><a name="pos900"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Is that lover boy Joseph?</p>
<p class="line" id="line901"><a name="pos901"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> It must be Joseph, there's no one else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line902"><a name="pos902"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line903"><a name="pos903"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> It is Joseph.</p>
<p class="line" id="line904"><a name="pos904"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Are you saying that you and Joseph had an affair?</p>
<p class="line" id="line905"><a name="pos905"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Yes.</p>

<p class="line" id="line907"><a name="pos907"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Sorry Mr Chair.  Thank you Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line908"><a name="pos908"></a>	Did Fouche tell you the reason why he killed Joseph?</p>

<p class="line" id="line910"><a name="pos910"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Did he ever accuse him of having done something before?</p>
<p class="line" id="line911"><a name="pos911"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Not that I know of.</p>
<p class="line" id="line912"><a name="pos912"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Were they on good terms, Joseph and Fouche?</p>
<p class="line" id="line913"><a name="pos913"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> It looked like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line914"><a name="pos914"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Was Fouche present when the Toyota was robbed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line915"><a name="pos915"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> When?</p>
<p class="line" id="line916"><a name="pos916"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Was a Toyota robbed, firstly?  The one that was used at a ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line917"><a name="pos917"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Robbed or stolen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line918"><a name="pos918"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Toyota?  No the Toyota they give back to us - I know it's a stolen car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line919"><a name="pos919"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Who gave you the car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line920"><a name="pos920"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Seuntjie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line921"><a name="pos921"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Who?</p>

<p class="line" id="line923"><a name="pos923"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Who is that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line924"><a name="pos924"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> One of those members, ja.</p>
<p class="line" id="line925"><a name="pos925"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> One of your members?  But you knew it was stolen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line926"><a name="pos926"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Ja.</p>
<p class="line" id="line927"><a name="pos927"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Which car is that, is that the one that was involved on the day of the shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line928"><a name="pos928"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> No, that was the red one, the red one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line929"><a name="pos929"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> And then the yellow one, do you know where it was found?</p>
<p class="line" id="line930"><a name="pos930"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> It was stolen the evening before the robbery.</p>
<p class="line" id="line931"><a name="pos931"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> By whom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line932"><a name="pos932"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> By all the members, I was also present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line933"><a name="pos933"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Was Fouche also there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line934"><a name="pos934"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Yes he was also present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line935"><a name="pos935"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SOGODI:</span> So you do know why the yellow car was stolen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line936"><a name="pos936"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> It was stolen specifically to be used in the robbery.  They didn't have a vehicle which they could use.</p>
<p class="line" id="line937"><a name="pos937"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Sorry, I wish to refer you to page 137 of your statement.  Paragraph 29, the underlined sentence.  Page 137, paragraph 29.  You see that?  There Fouche is supposed to have said he wanted to get Joseph because he, Joseph, had cheated him on a transaction at Lesotho?  Do you see that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line938"><a name="pos938"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Yes I do see that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line939"><a name="pos939"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Did he say that to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line940"><a name="pos940"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Yes it's in here then he did say that to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line941"><a name="pos941"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> He did say that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line942"><a name="pos942"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line943"><a name="pos943"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> So is it possible that there were activities that Fouche was involved in but you were not aware of?</p>
<p class="line" id="line944"><a name="pos944"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> That can be possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line945"><a name="pos945"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line946"><a name="pos946"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Because they used my car for a week, I wasn't present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line947"><a name="pos947"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> And where is the car?  What happened to that car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line948"><a name="pos948"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> It got stolen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line949"><a name="pos949"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Was it later recovered?</p>
<p class="line" id="line950"><a name="pos950"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Recovered, ja.</p>
<p class="line" id="line951"><a name="pos951"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> What was the story about it, what were you told about it as to what had happened to that car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line952"><a name="pos952"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> It was in Natalspruit and they said that there were weapons in the car and I could not get it back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line953"><a name="pos953"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Who was using the car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line954"><a name="pos954"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Joseph and Chris.</p>
<p class="line" id="line955"><a name="pos955"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> And Fouche?</p>
<p class="line" id="line956"><a name="pos956"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Ja it's Fouche.</p>
<p class="line" id="line957"><a name="pos957"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Chris Fouche, oh.   That's the story you got?</p>
<p class="line" id="line958"><a name="pos958"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Yes that was the story.</p>
<p class="line" id="line959"><a name="pos959"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Do you know anything about the involvement of the police in your group whether your group was involved with the police or the police involved with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line960"><a name="pos960"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> No I carry no knowledge of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line961"><a name="pos961"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Except Fouche of course?</p>
<p class="line" id="line962"><a name="pos962"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Ja.</p>
<p class="line" id="line963"><a name="pos963"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> The other, do you know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line964"><a name="pos964"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> I do not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line965"><a name="pos965"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line966"><a name="pos966"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MADASA</p>
<p class="line" id="line967"><a name="pos967"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR STEENKAMP:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, just two or three questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line968"><a name="pos968"></a>	Ms de Lange, the statement on page 254 of the thick bundle, do you have that in front of you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line969"><a name="pos969"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line970"><a name="pos970"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Do you stick to the contents of that statement?  So are you still convinced that what you said here was correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line971"><a name="pos971"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Are you referring to paragraph 4?</p>
<p class="line" id="line972"><a name="pos972"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> No I'm referring to the whole statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line973"><a name="pos973"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Yes, I stick with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line974"><a name="pos974"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> In all great respect then I do not understand your evidence today and I would like to read to you paragraph 4.  Paragraph 4 Mr Chairman</p>
<p class="line" id="line975"><a name="pos975"></a>	"According to me they were not involved in political </p>
<p class="line" id="line976"><a name="pos976"></a>	activities"</p>
<p class="line" id="line977"><a name="pos977"></a>and today you are saying under oath that they carried cards, they were members of the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line978"><a name="pos978"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> It doesn't mean if you are a member of the ANC that you're involved in politics and that you are going to kill people, how many times must I say this.  You might be a member of a party but it doesn't mean that you're involved in killing of people with regards to politics.</p>
<p class="line" id="line979"><a name="pos979"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> So why did you not mention that in your statement, why did you choose to say that they were not involved with politics at all?  Why didn't you say in your statement that they were card carrying members.  Do you understand my question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line980"><a name="pos980"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Yes I understand the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line981"><a name="pos981"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Why is there a difference in your evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line982"><a name="pos982"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Probably because it's four years ago and I'm sitting here today.</p>
<p class="line" id="line983"><a name="pos983"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Which of the versions do we have to believe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line984"><a name="pos984"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> They were not involved in politics, they did not kill and rob for the sake of politics.</p>
<p class="line" id="line985"><a name="pos985"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> The problem I've got with that is that even Fouche, as I listen to you today, even Fouche says in his statement that the deceased were not involved in politics?</p>
<p class="line" id="line986"><a name="pos986"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Yes, they were not involved in politics.</p>
<p class="line" id="line987"><a name="pos987"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> So it's only you and the applicant then as far as I know who told this Committee today that these members were in fact ANC members, no one else says this except yourself and the applicant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line988"><a name="pos988"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> No, Mr Steenkamp, that is not correct.  This witness said that they were members of the ANC and that they were card carrying members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line989"><a name="pos989"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Mr Chairman, I'm sorry if I did not put it in correct - I'd rather put the question again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line990"><a name="pos990"></a>	The problem I have is this, it's only you and the applicant, Mr de Ru, who told the Committee today, under oath, that the deceased were ANC members.  All the other people who knew the deceased, even the family and even the informant Mr de Ru used, denies that the deceased were ANC members.  Do you understand my question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line991"><a name="pos991"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Yes I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line992"><a name="pos992"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Now I'm asking you why is that the case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line993"><a name="pos993"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> I knew Joseph much longer than all of them, I met Joseph in 1983, so why would I say he had a card if he didn't have a card.  He had to survive in Sebokeng in all those times and it would not have happened if they were not members of the ANC, otherwise Inkatha or another one could have killed or otherwise I would not have been allowed there, I did not say they were involved but they were members of the ANC, they were members of the ANC.  I'm only talking about Joseph now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line994"><a name="pos994"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Just stop with Joseph for a while, you said that Joseph specifically always told me that he does not get involved with politics.</p>
<p class="line" id="line995"><a name="pos995"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Yes but that does not mean if we talk about politics - he said that because I'm white I do not want to get involved with politics, we do not talk politics, we do not talk murder, we do not talk robbery, we do not talk about those things because the politics in Sebokeng at that time was to kill and Inkatha was the biggest problem, I say that again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line996"><a name="pos996"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Can we just try and clarify a thing here Mr Steenkamp?   Ms de Lange, if Steenkamp asks you about politics and I hear the question, I'd say to be a member of a political party and to attend meetings, that's political involvement but when you talk about politics you also always mention murder and fighting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line997"><a name="pos997"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> But that's what they told me, if they say to me that I was - they keep telling me that they were actively involved.  They were not actively involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line998"><a name="pos998"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> But you yourself were not actively involved either?</p>
<p class="line" id="line999"><a name="pos999"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> No I wasn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1000"><a name="pos1000"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> You were member of the party, you attended the meetings so for you was actively involved, it meant that you were involved in the fight in the townships?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1001"><a name="pos1001"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Yes those are the people who fought guerilla warfare.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1002"><a name="pos1002"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Do you refer to that as politics and active and the fighting between the Inkatha Youth etc and the defending of the townships, as far as you're concerned that's politics?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1003"><a name="pos1003"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1004"><a name="pos1004"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Otherwise it only means being a member or a supporter of the ANC and you distinguish between that and being politically involved or active.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1005"><a name="pos1005"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> I distinguish between that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1006"><a name="pos1006"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I think that's probably the misunderstanding.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1007"><a name="pos1007"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, I'll leave the question there.  Just one or two questions if you would allow me Mr Chairman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1008"><a name="pos1008"></a>	Do you know if the deceased were ever involved in political violence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1009"><a name="pos1009"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> No never.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1010"><a name="pos1010"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> You see then you also heard that I asked the same question from Mr de Ru and Mr de Ru gave another answer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1011"><a name="pos1011"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Yes I did hear that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1012"><a name="pos1012"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Why does your evidence differ from that of Mr de Ru?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1013"><a name="pos1013"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Because Mr de Ru talked about six policemen who were killed and of that I do not know anything and I would have been aware of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1014"><a name="pos1014"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Now if Mr de Ru says this is he telling a lie?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1015"><a name="pos1015"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> I do not know, maybe he's got other information that I don't known about, about that I do not know anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1016"><a name="pos1016"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Ms de Lange, is it not true that this group that you knew so well was just an ordinary group, criminal group who went out to get financial benefit and were not involved in politics at all, is that not the reason or the way in which this group operated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1017"><a name="pos1017"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Yes, according to me there was no politics involved they just robbed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1018"><a name="pos1018"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Were they ever involved in any crimes like murder and robbery?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1019"><a name="pos1019"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Yes maybe robberies because cars were robbed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1020"><a name="pos1020"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> But never murder?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1021"><a name="pos1021"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> No never, not where I was involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1022"><a name="pos1022"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Would you say that according to your knowledge and that is my last question, that Mr de Ru could have in any possibility have a case against these people?  Could he arrest them for any offence at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1023"><a name="pos1023"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Yes he could have.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1024"><a name="pos1024"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> What offences?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1025"><a name="pos1025"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> They had stolen weapons with them and a stolen vehicle and he could have arrested them for that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1026"><a name="pos1026"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> And Mr de Ru knew about it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1027"><a name="pos1027"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Yes he knew about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1028"><a name="pos1028"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Can you give an explanation why he never arrested them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1029"><a name="pos1029"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> No I do not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1030"><a name="pos1030"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1031"><a name="pos1031"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR STEENKAMP</p>
<p class="line" id="line1032"><a name="pos1032"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Ms de Lange, you say that Mr de Ru was aware of the fact that there were stolen weapons with them?  You also testified that at more than one opportunity you saw him and that you took weapons to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1033"><a name="pos1033"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1034"><a name="pos1034"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> For remuneration as part of the scheme, can you remember how many times you took weapons to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1035"><a name="pos1035"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> The first weapon I took was an AK and a shotgun, a 765, a PPK, a Baby Brown and a 38 Special.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1036"><a name="pos1036"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So you're talking about six weapons that you took to him?  Did he give you money for that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1037"><a name="pos1037"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> No I did not receive anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1038"><a name="pos1038"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Why not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1039"><a name="pos1039"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> They said that they are waiting until the case was completed.  That is what the people are saying now.  We complained a lot because we said we want our remuneration and they said that this comes from the top and it's not them who can give us this money.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1040"><a name="pos1040"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So you never received anything up till today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1041"><a name="pos1041"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> No, never.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1042"><a name="pos1042"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Can you remember how many times you saw him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1043"><a name="pos1043"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Quite a few times because he came to the house.  We went to Fouche a lot and we complained with him about the remuneration and asked why don't we get our money?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1044"><a name="pos1044"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Are you talking about three times or ten times or twenty times?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1045"><a name="pos1045"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Every day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1046"><a name="pos1046"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You saw him every day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1047"><a name="pos1047"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1048"><a name="pos1048"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And he never talked to you about any activities?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1049"><a name="pos1049"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Chris?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1050"><a name="pos1050"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> No, did I talk about Fouche?  Mr de Ru?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1051"><a name="pos1051"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> No I didn't see Mr Roux that often.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1052"><a name="pos1052"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> How often did you see Mr de Ru?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1053"><a name="pos1053"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Only when I phoned him to come to my house or when we went to his house or to the police station.  Let's say about five times.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1054"><a name="pos1054"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Now the weapons that you handed in, who did you give this to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1055"><a name="pos1055"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Some of the weapons I gave to De Ru directly and the others were given to Fouche to give to De Ru.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1056"><a name="pos1056"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did you live in Sebokeng with Joseph since 1983?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1057"><a name="pos1057"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Yes I did stay there for a while.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1058"><a name="pos1058"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> For a while?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1059"><a name="pos1059"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Yes I would say for about six months.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1060"><a name="pos1060"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> What did you do then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1061"><a name="pos1061"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> We had a model school.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1062"><a name="pos1062"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> In 1991, 1992?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1063"><a name="pos1063"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1064"><a name="pos1064"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1065"><a name="pos1065"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Today I'm working at the municipality.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1066"><a name="pos1066"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I would just like to get an idea of your political involvement.  You said you were an ANC member, you joined them, you attended meetings and you say that you were MK.  Now that confuses me and the applicant's advocate.  Can you tell me, how did you join MK?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1067"><a name="pos1067"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> I joined the ANC or I started with the ANC in Sebokeng and I said that I cannot be an ordinary member because at that stage whites haven't joined yet.  I'll have to join at the MK wing, I had to learn how to use weapons and because we were involved with a lot of weapons, that is why they said that I was member of MK not just an ordinary member of the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1068"><a name="pos1068"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did they just tell you that you were a member of the MK?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1069"><a name="pos1069"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> I later received a card that said I was an MK  member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1070"><a name="pos1070"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Who told you this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1071"><a name="pos1071"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> It was Radebe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1072"><a name="pos1072"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> From Sebokeng?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1073"><a name="pos1073"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Yes, we only knew him as Radebe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1074"><a name="pos1074"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did you have any activities with them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1075"><a name="pos1075"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> No I did not work with them.  They gave me books an stuff to read and that I did and they showed me the weapons that they had and that is about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1076"><a name="pos1076"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did you receive any training in the handling of weapons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1077"><a name="pos1077"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> We did shoot yes in Zonkezizwe with AK's.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1078"><a name="pos1078"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1079"><a name="pos1079"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you did receive some military training?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1080"><a name="pos1080"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Yes but it was not guerilla warfare in that I was in the bush.  They told me what is a 9 mm, what is an AK and what rounds are used and to really use it, no I did not receive that training.  I shot twice with an AK47, that was when Fouche was with us at Zonkezizwe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1081"><a name="pos1081"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How long was Fouche with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1082"><a name="pos1082"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Probably four months.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1083"><a name="pos1083"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SOGODI:</span> As a member of the MK, who was your commander?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1084"><a name="pos1084"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Radebe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1085"><a name="pos1085"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SOGODI:</span> Did he know about your involvement with the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1086"><a name="pos1086"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1087"><a name="pos1087"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SOGODI:</span> What was the MK's relationship with the police then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1088"><a name="pos1088"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Not very good.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1089"><a name="pos1089"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SOGODI:</span> No I want more detail on that because I'm trying to think of a situation where the MK would have dealings with the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1090"><a name="pos1090"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> It was to get cash.  They would remunerate us for the weapons that we handed in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1091"><a name="pos1091"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SOGODI:</span> The police would remunerate the MK members for cash for weapons that ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1092"><a name="pos1092"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> They didn't know that I was a member of MK.  They said on the T.V., it was even on the radio, anybody who handed in a weapon, AK's and something like that, they get money for that.  That was to take all those weapons out of the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1093"><a name="pos1093"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SOGODI:</span> So your commander knew that you were taking weapons out of the community and taking them back to the police and getting remuneration for that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1094"><a name="pos1094"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> For money.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1095"><a name="pos1095"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Ms de Lange, if I say to you that you were never a member of MK, it was just part of a game, you were white and you were a member of the - you received books, you did not really know what was going on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1096"><a name="pos1096"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> In politics yes, I believe I didn't know what was going on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1097"><a name="pos1097"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Because MK started the STU's(?), they had to train them, they had to ensure stability, security, you were never part of that?  You were never involved in that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1098"><a name="pos1098"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> All that I wanted to know - if I only had the protection of the community there, if I said that I was a member of the MK to move around.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1099"><a name="pos1099"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> The fact that you were a MK member, is that not part of your imagination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1100"><a name="pos1100"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> No because I was with them because where else would we have received these weapons from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1101"><a name="pos1101"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> The weapons were freely obtainable, anyone could get a weapon at that stage in that area.  It was stolen and you traded in it and anyhow it was practice and it was exactly the idea to get it out of that area and the ANC and STU's at certain areas worked together to get these weapons out of the community in order to stop the violence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1102"><a name="pos1102"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> That is what we did.  We took the weapons out of the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1103"><a name="pos1103"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But I would put it to you that you were never a member of the MK and that it's part of your imagination.  Maybe your own opinion of yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1104"><a name="pos1104"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> I cannot think how it can be myself importance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1105"><a name="pos1105"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Have you still got your membership cards?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1106"><a name="pos1106"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Yes I've got my ANC membership cards.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1107"><a name="pos1107"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You said earlier you also had an MK card?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1108"><a name="pos1108"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Yes I did have one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1109"><a name="pos1109"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Do you still have it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1110"><a name="pos1110"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> No I do not have it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1111"><a name="pos1111"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did you ever have it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1112"><a name="pos1112"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Yes I did have one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1113"><a name="pos1113"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Why is it gone?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1114"><a name="pos1114"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> I travelled a few times and I was arrested by the police and I didn't think or see the need for keeping it.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1141"><a name="pos1141"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> '92.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1142"><a name="pos1142"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> 1992 and at the bottom there of that page the photo indicated - is that you in that photo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1143"><a name="pos1143"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> It must be yes, I'm the only person who joined the ANC that year.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1144"><a name="pos1144"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> With some members, clenched fists, look you seem to be addressing a crowd or something.  Just have a look at it?  It's the small bundle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1145"><a name="pos1145"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Ja it's me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1146"><a name="pos1146"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> What was going on there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1147"><a name="pos1147"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> We had a rally.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1148"><a name="pos1148"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Where?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1149"><a name="pos1149"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> In Zandele Stadium.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1150"><a name="pos1150"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Where?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1151"><a name="pos1151"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> At Zandele Stadium.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1152"><a name="pos1152"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Where is Zandele?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1153"><a name="pos1153"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> It's a location of Sasolburg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1154"><a name="pos1154"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> What was the rally about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1155"><a name="pos1155"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1156"><a name="pos1156"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> You can't remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1157"><a name="pos1157"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> No I can't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1158"><a name="pos1158"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Lastly, it is therefore - you remember you said there were activities you were not aware of that your group was involved in?  Now I'm following on that - would you agree with me that therefore there is a possibility that the applicant, Mr de Ru, could have been given information that was wrong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1159"><a name="pos1159"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1160"><a name="pos1160"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Either by Fouche or by a member or your group, is that not possible?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1161"><a name="pos1161"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> That is possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1162"><a name="pos1162"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Or he was given information that was in fact correct but you were not aware of?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1163"><a name="pos1163"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1164"><a name="pos1164"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> I have no further questions, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1165"><a name="pos1165"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MADASA</p>
<p class="line" id="line1166"><a name="pos1166"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I just want to clarify something that I missed, I'm afraid I didn't - you've told us about the guns that you took along, an AK, a shotgun, a PPK, a Baby Brown and then what were the two others?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1167"><a name="pos1167"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> A 765 and a 38.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1168"><a name="pos1168"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1169"><a name="pos1169"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> A 38.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1170"><a name="pos1170"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you ever see any of these guns again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1171"><a name="pos1171"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Ja when they started the investigation after this robbery I saw those guns again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1172"><a name="pos1172"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Which ones?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1173"><a name="pos1173"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> It was the Walter PPK and the 765.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1174"><a name="pos1174"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry the?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1175"><a name="pos1175"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Walter PPK.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1176"><a name="pos1176"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> PPK and were they at the scene of this killing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1177"><a name="pos1177"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1178"><a name="pos1178"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you know what the calibre of the PPK was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1179"><a name="pos1179"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> 765.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1180"><a name="pos1180"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1181"><a name="pos1181"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Can you remember which of these weapons you gave to De Ru?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1182"><a name="pos1182"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> I gave him a Baby Brown and about the others I'm not sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1183"><a name="pos1183"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You gave him the Baby Brown?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1184"><a name="pos1184"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1185"><a name="pos1185"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And you didn't see that again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1186"><a name="pos1186"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> No, never.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1187"><a name="pos1187"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you.  Sorry, I'm just going to take this a bit further.  The firearms which you gave to Chris Fouche, where did you hand it over to him, at the police station?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1188"><a name="pos1188"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> No, the AK47 we went get ourselves at Zonkesizwe and he took it directly from there to the police station.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1189"><a name="pos1189"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Why did you think you'll get money for this because you didn't hand it over to the police, you gave it to Chris who was part of your gang?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1190"><a name="pos1190"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> No, Chris wasn't supposed to be part of the gang.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1191"><a name="pos1191"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But he knew about everything?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1192"><a name="pos1192"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> It was in order to gain information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1193"><a name="pos1193"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> For who?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1194"><a name="pos1194"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> For the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1195"><a name="pos1195"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> From whom, from yourselves?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1196"><a name="pos1196"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Yes from us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1197"><a name="pos1197"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Political information?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1198"><a name="pos1198"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> No, with regards to weapons.  They were looking for weapons, firearms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1199"><a name="pos1199"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And you give him firearms which you got in the township which he would then take to the police station.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1200"><a name="pos1200"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> What else would he have done with them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1201"><a name="pos1201"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But my question is, you hand over the weapons to him while he's visiting you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1202"><a name="pos1202"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> No, when we finished he had to take the firearms to the police station and it had to be written down somewhere so that we could get the remuneration for it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1203"><a name="pos1203"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But he always got the weapons from him, you never went and took it to the police station?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1204"><a name="pos1204"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> No, I don't think we ever actually took it to the police station.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1205"><a name="pos1205"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And the weapon which you gave to Mr De Ru where did that happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1206"><a name="pos1206"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> At my house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1207"><a name="pos1207"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Also at your house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1208"><a name="pos1208"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But you never got any remuneration for any of these weapons either so how can you say he must have taken it to the police station?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1209"><a name="pos1209"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Because I got my money for the diamonds before from that Vosloo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1210"><a name="pos1210"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you hand diamonds over to Vosloo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1211"><a name="pos1211"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Ja, he was from the ...[indistinct] Welkom.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1212"><a name="pos1212"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And he paid you for them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1213"><a name="pos1213"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1214"><a name="pos1214"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But Fouche never paid you for the guns?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1215"><a name="pos1215"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> No, never.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1216"><a name="pos1216"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> May I just ask one question?  Ms de Lange, did you ever speak to Mr de Ru about the firearms and did you ever ask him for the money?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1217"><a name="pos1217"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Yes, we asked him once and he said that certain forms had to be filled in and the amount was coming from the top and it's a long process.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1218"><a name="pos1218"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So he received these weapons from Fouche?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1219"><a name="pos1219"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> Yes he definitely received them because he said it would be about R15 000.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1220"><a name="pos1220"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you expect to be paid R15 000 for handing in one AK47, one shotgun and four handguns.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1221"><a name="pos1221"></a><span class="speaker">MS DE LANGE:</span> That's not the amount that we expected, that's they amount that he told us about.  He told us that is the amount we are going to get.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1222"><a name="pos1222"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you, no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1223"><a name="pos1223"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> No further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1224"><a name="pos1224"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> This concludes this witness, I'm not sure from what you've said whether you have another witness or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1225"><a name="pos1225"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1226"><a name="pos1226"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line1227"><a name="pos1227"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do any of the other parties have witnesses?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1228"><a name="pos1228"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Mr Chairman, I don't have any witnesses to call at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1229"><a name="pos1229"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> Mr Chairman, I don't want to call any witnesses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1230"><a name="pos1230"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So we can commence with argument tomorrow morning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1231"><a name="pos1231"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Mr Chair, I know this may be disruptive but there are certain aspects that we want to look into and would ask permission to make submissions in writing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1232"><a name="pos1232"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can't you address oral argument and if you have any additional submissions that you can do so in writing?  We've heard evidence today, we can hear argument on that evidence tomorrow.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1233"><a name="pos1233"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Mr Chair, we need time, Mr Chair to refer to - to look into certain matters and as far as the law is concerned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1234"><a name="pos1234"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, that you can do by submitting written argument.  We want argument tomorrow on the evidence that we have heard today.  Not on the legal effect of that evidence, simply on the value to be attached and inferences to be drawn from it.  Very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1235"><a name="pos1235"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Mr Chair, I propose we do all that in writing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1236"><a name="pos1236"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why?  Why cannot you - you've heard the evidence, you've been here, you've prepared your client's evidence, why can't you address us on it tomorrow?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1237"><a name="pos1237"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> There are matters I want to research on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1238"><a name="pos1238"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You've told us you want to research on the law, I do not see how you can want to research when I'm asking you merely to address us on the evidence that has been given before us today.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1239"><a name="pos1239"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> But that would be piecemeal submission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1240"><a name="pos1240"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It may well be but it disposes of all argument on the evidence.  What are the views of the other gentlemen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1241"><a name="pos1241"></a><span class="speaker">MR COETZEE:</span> Mr Chairman I'm going to be very brief with regard to argument so I am available tomorrow for argument.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1242"><a name="pos1242"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Mr Chairman, I'm going to be very brief as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1243"><a name="pos1243"></a><span class="speaker">MR JOUBERT:</span> Mr Chairman, basically I have no argument.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1244"><a name="pos1244"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We expect you to do some homework tonight.  We adjourn till 09H30 tomorrow morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1245"><a name="pos1245"></a><span class="speaker">MR STEENKAMP:</span> Mr Chairman, may I just put the record straight and if needs be I'll submit certain documentation?  I don't want to embarrass my learned friends here but Mr Malan was subpoenaed on a request of my learned colleagues here.  I have just spoken briefly to my colleague here and he indicates to me that he doesn't need Mr Malan here any more so as far as at least I am concerned, Mr Malan is not relevant at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1246"><a name="pos1246"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I don't think it's necessary to quite say he's not relevant at all but I think his presence here is no longer relevant.  You're excused from further attendance and thank you for having made yourself available today - 9.30 tomorrow.</p>
