I would tell you why I knew about this, I was working as a - with the trade unionist.\n\tNow each and every person's individual profile was supposed to be on date.  Now the people whom we used, the informers, told me that Citi's house was burnt down.  I wrote a report and my immediate superior, who was Prinsloo, said go and inspect how the house was burnt.  It was a four roomed house and the big window was broken.  The curtains, I remember very well, they were pink in colour, but you'd see they had smoke as if they were burnt.  That is the reason why I knew about Citi's house, not his parents house.  It's my first time to hear today that his parent's home was burnt.",
