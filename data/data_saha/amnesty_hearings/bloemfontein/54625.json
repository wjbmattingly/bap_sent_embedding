According to him it was chronological that the first incident was according to this applicant. \n\tShortly, he told the Commission that that day he was standing there, he said was only wearing his trousers, he was relaxed. A police vehicle came there and it came to a standstill, and then immediately shots were fired at him. I am talking under correction, but he said that Mr Mamome had fired the first shots. \tLater on he could not tell us who else had fired shots at him because, as he said in his evidence, when you are being shot at and you are running away you just try to get away as quickly as possible.

I am not going to try to provide detail about what happened on the border, it is well known information. \n\tWhat is, however, important according to me is the fact that he was brought there, he was brought to the Security Branch, there he was identified as one of the leaders of that group. For three consecutive days, according to him, he was assaulted, and he identified Mr Mamome, Terreblanche and Mafisa and others. And he said that he knew Mr Motsamai very well and also Ngo who was on the scene.\n\tHe also told us that as a result of the injuries he was treated in hospital and still has problems with his ears at the moment because of those injuries sustained.\n\tMr Chairman, what I think regarding this witness, I think his evidence was given in a truthful way.

It is item 6.1, the murder in Melk Street.\n\tMr Chairman, you will remember that Mr Oliphant testified that as a result of disinformation which was distributed by the Security Police, he was branded as the murderer of Mr George Musi. He also tells us that his family up till this stage has rejected him totally as a result of that disinformation provided. You will also remember that here in the dock while he was interrogated regarding this incident, that he burst into tears and some members of the Truth Commission had to assist him.

The Lekiklane women, they are also part of item 6.15. Shortly, they testified that they were assaulted physically, exercises done, they were hit with electrical wires, and they also identified Mr Motsamai, Mamome, Ngo and Erasmus and, to a lesser degree, Mr Kopi, they implicate them in their assaults. One of them said she did not do exercises because she was wearing a dress. I think that was Doreen Lekitlane. Yes, that is correct. I stand to be corrected in that respect.\n\tThe fact of the matter is that those three ladies were seriously assaulted and in spite of the fact that they were women, I think that the members of the Security Branch did not care about their sex, etc.\n\tI think this matter of Annie Phalane can be associated with that. She was hit with an open hand, she saw Ngo and Motsamai there but according to her the person who do most of the torturing was Mr Du Plooy. \n\tShe was detained for a period and she tell us that she received no medical treatment, there as no medical treatment available after that incident where they sustained the injuries. And important, according to me, she also denies that Mr Erasmus would come to Glen police station to do a kind of inspection there.\n\tMr Chairman, the matter of Mr Jwayi - he was a member of the group of 19, 6.15 - he identifies Mr Ngo and Motsamai, but he says the person who assaulted him was a certain Mr Killian. He identified particularly Mr Killian. He said that he was detained afterwards, but he also was assaulted with the fist, hit with an open hand and they swore at him. He also, I mean, is a victim of the actions of the Security Police and specifically the common action of all of them.\n\tMr Chairman, Serame Molefe, you will remember that he testified how he after he had come back from Robben Island was harassed because of Mr Motsamai's actions, lost his job ...[intervention].",

He was very certain of all the facts, he was convincing in telling all the sorrow which he sustained, and I also think that in all respects we can believe what he told us. Mr Chairman, his matter will be found under 2.2 in the pre-trial matters. \n\tAccording to me it is so that Mr White Mohape gave us a detailed statement on what had happened to him, from the beginning to the end. He told us that he was detained, firstly because of the fact that there was an alleged accusation against him, namely that he had tried to commit murder, you remember the knife incident that he was found not guilty and was acquitted. And then on the 27 April 1984 while he was being detained at the Bayswater police station - and immediately I want to interrupt myself by saying that Mr Mohape was not certain about the specific date when those things took place regarding the year.",

I don't think there was a friendly relationship between them. At least one can say that they did not accept this relationship; these people were not accepted. But I think history has proved itself and at least among some people there were feelings of hate.\n\tRegarding Mr Matthews Mzuzwana, it is item 6.8, the so-called attempted murder of Mzuzwana. Mr Chairman, I also think that he can be regarded as a victim. He explained his political activities as a member of Mico, the youth congregation, and he tells us in detail how on that day, after having attended a sermon, police officers shot at them. \n\tDuring cross-examination regarding Mzuzwana's evidence, there was once dispute regarding the involvement of Mr Ngo, and there was a difference of opinion regarding what was mentioned in a civil action and here. What is important is that his face is enough evidence of what had happened to them. There could be no doubt that he was shot with a stopper gun, and as Mr Motsamai said in his application, he was present when he was shot with a stopper gun.

Mr Chairman, I can't take it any further.\n\tThere was a so-called common purpose, at least with Mr Motsamai, when this incident took place.\n\tMr Chairman, I told you that I would later come back to some of these members. Mr Makubalo, I think - I just want to find the place - he was a member of the Mico, this is the so-called Mangu Youth Congregation who was affiliated to the UDF. The Group of 19 were all members of the same organisation, namely Mico. Mr Mohape was a member of Cosas, Mr Molefe, a member of the PAC, Mr Matthews Mzuzwana was also a member of Mico. What I am trying to say is that all the members of the prejudiced people or all these victims had a political affiliation and therefore, I think, they meet that requirement.\n\tMr Chairman, this brings me back to the improbabilities that you should be taken in consideration regarding the evidence of the police. I am not going to refer to specific officials, but I am going to refer in general to eh police evidence without referring to some specific person. What could be said of one could be said of everybody.\n\tMr Chairman, we have heard here about, as a monotonous \nway of denying all the evidence. Every time the matter when it was mentioned, he denied that he had been there or he denied that he was involved in whatever way, or he just said in general that he denied it. What is important is the fact that the Security Branch in Bloemfontein at no stage did any assaults, tolerate it, or allowed it, despite the fact that not this Committee, but also other Committees knew that in other centres people were readily assaulted and maltreated.\n\tThis Security Branch said this never happened here. What is very important is, when these police officers were asked, but if Mr Motsamai and Ngo referred to that, they were branded as the only people who could have been part of those incidents, the probabilities just point to the opposite.\n\tThe aspect of the Group of 19. Nobody heard any shouting; nobody saw anything. It is a large group of 19 who were assaulted there; nobody knew anything about that except Mr Ngo and Mr Motsamai.

Mr Motsamai was a member of the Security Branch at all times and in respect of all the incidents for which he has applied for amnesty, Mr Motsamai has given an account which is logical and complete. The account which he gives in each instance is not fraught with improbability. It finds corroboration from victims and in the case of George Musi from an inquest report.\n\tIn giving his evidence, Mr Motsamai at no stage has appeared to be minimising his role in the commission of his offences. In fact, in all the confessions he appears to have been the key player. He is the one who manufactured petrol bombs; he is the one who throws them; he is the one who shot at Musi while Mamome was present, and Mamome had at all times had the gun. In the case of Maguwalhu he does admit that \"I also shot\". \tHis commission of these offences, Mr Chairman, was obviously not for personal gain but was motivated by ...[intervention]",

            "I will be dealing with Makubalo, maybe we should just finish him off anyway, Mr Chairman.\n\tIn the case of Makubalo, Mr Chairman, my submission is that the evidence of all the other policemen who testified should be rejected as being false. Clearly, they were not being truthful about the incident. \n\tOne, Mamome, for instance, suggests that he used the vehicle to chase Mr Makubalo while the evidence of the rest of the people suggests that the vehicle was stationary where they had found Mr Makubalo. That would be motivated by a desire on his part to deny that he was chasing after Makubalo and that he fired shots at Mr Makubalo.Two, he made the ridiculous suggestion that there is a policeman who never carries a firearm, and that clearly was motivated by a desire to deny that he fired shots on that day.\n\tHe also denied ever having worked with Motsamai when, in fact, time and again from evidence spontaneously it did appear from the evidence that he did work with Motsamai. And the latest case was that of Coetzee who said that he used to work with Motsamai and Mamome.\n\tThe rest of the witnesses were clearly conspiring against Mzuzwane. That conspiracy is evidenced by the fact that each of them was certain that Mr Motsamai was the only one who shot at Mr Makubalo at all times, and yet during cross-examination it appeared that on their evidence Mr Motsamai and Mr Makubalo were not in their view at all times when the shots were being fired. Now, you would ask yourself, what made them then believe that it is Motsamai only who shot? The only explanation is that they just ganged up against him and decided that they were going to say that Motsamai shot.\n\tMr Chairman, there is also the difficulty that each one of them had, which is that they never applied for amnesty, and it cannot be said that the shooting of Makubalo was lawful. In order for the shooting to have been justifiable in terms of, I think, s 49, it would have required that he first should have been warned. There was no suggestion that he was warned. \n\tFirstly, there was no suggestion that he was warned that he was about to be arrested. \n\tSecondly, there was no suggestion that any warning shots were ever fired at him. So, clearly, not one of them regarded the shooting at Makubalo as being lawful, hence the desire on their part to distance themselves from the shooting.\n\tMr Chairman, the probability is that Mr Makubalo, rather Mr Mamome was the first to shoot. He would have been the first to shoot because the victim was on his side. He was the driver, he was sitting on the right side. He would have been the nearest to Mr Makubalo, and that also explains the fact that eventually he caught Makubalo.",

Of importance is that Mr Motsamai is applying for amnesty as a result of the fact that he together with other policemen fired shots at Makubalo, reckless as to the consequences of firing those shots at Makubalo.

            "Tito said he saw a person; he did not say there was only one person, and he does not know why he did not see the second person.\n\tMr Chairman, I also want to then say that it is improbable that a policeman would have been sent out alone to go and kill someone. What Mamome has said must not be believed. First he denies every working with Motsamai; he denies belonging to any club with Motsamai, and at the same time he says he has no differences with Motsamai. And Motsamai himself is not motivated by any malice in implicating Mamome.\n\tMr Chairman, the probability that he would have been instructed by Coetzee is strong. Oliphant is in detention when Mr Musi is killed, but whilst he is in detention members of the Security Branch approach him and say, 'yes, you killed your uncle'. Later on he is released from detention, he is ten ostracised by him family because it is believed that he killed his uncle.\n\tThe killing of George Musi occurs after people who were using his house as a safe house, are detained, attempting to skip the country.\n\tMr Chairman, I then wish to deal with the application regarding Nicos. All the policemen who testified here, testified that they knew Nicos; they used to go to his night-club just to enjoy drinks. They never had anything to do with him that was work related. On the other hand, Mr Chairman, Mr Motsamai tells us that, 'no, amongst other things I and harassed Nicos'. Perhaps a better word would have been 'to monitor'. At the same time he says that, 'I harassed Serame Molefe'. \tThere is a connection between Molefe and Nicos. Serame Molefi was employed by Nicos after he had been to Robben Island. Mr Chairman, it is common knowledge that the police monitored people who had just been released from prison for politically related offences. Therefore, it is probable that they would have followed Molefi and too they would have wanted to know what it is that they shared with Nicos that would have made Nicos employ Serame. Serame told us - I am sorry that I keep on referring to him by his first name - Mr Molefi told us that he was followed; every time when he got employment the police went there and spoiled things, and every time he was dismissed.\n\tThere was no attempt at all when evidence was led to deny that these things did happen to Mr Molefi and therefore his evidence stands. Insofar as Nicos is concerned, Mr Molefi tells us that he decorated his shop and his house in colours that resembled the colours of the ANC and/or the PAC. The police were not too happy about that fact.\n\tMr Chairman, the police have come and testified here, they have not denied these things, save to make a bad denial that they did not have anything to do with Nicos. But one would have expected them to come and say, 'we did see the painting'. This is not a submission I want to make; what I wish to make is, if Serame were fabricating they would have come and said, 'look, his house was not painted in such a way', and would have had nothing to do with it. They would also come to say, 'look, even if the house had been painted in ANC or PAC colours, it would not have mattered to us; this man is lying'. So his evidence, in my submission, on that aspect stands.\n\tHe further told us that Nicos used to help comrades - that is now Motsamai, Mr Chairman. He used to help comrades at their funeral.",

In any event, we do not know why the policeman lived there and how Mr Nicos felt about it.

It is clear, in the first place, on the part of Mr Ngo it is a somewhat reckless mistake. He was a policeman in 1986 but he says during 1986 he was a student and members of Cosas. I don't see a reason why a victim would lie about when he was injured, and I also don't see a reason why a person who seeks amnesty would lie\nabout when he did something.\n\tOf importance is that Mr Ngo describes the incident and paints a logical and complete picture of how the thing occurred. He provides names of people who participated in an incident which is described by Mr Mohape which occurred whilst he was not present. If I may repeat, Mr Chairman. What I want to say is that Ngo tells us that two people were instructed to go and kidnap Mohape. He knows those people. He corroborates Mohape who says,'near Bayswater police station I was attacked by two unknown policemen'. He further says that the instruction was that they would drive him to a certain veld, and he says that they later joined the group that had abducted Mr Mohape. That is corroborated by Mr Mohape himself. Mr Mohape says that it was four people who attacked him. He does say that he, Ngo, was with Umhjala and Cronje, and in his description of the incident he says that Cronje did not participate in the beating up.\n\tMr Chairman, insofar Ngo would have implicated Mr Motsamai he explained, firstly, that he had a tendency to confuse Mr Motsamai's name with Mr Mtyhala's name.

He was the person at one stage who was asked to phone Mr Mohape and lure him out of the house so that he could be attacked. He was a person who probably reported a lot about Mr Mohape.\n\tMr Chairman, these difficulties we cannot answer, we do not why they chose to use an informer who was not a full member of the Security Branch at the time, and we do not know why they took the risk of sending someone known to Mr Mohape.\nBut it doesn't seem that there was any suggestion that those policemen who were sent to Mr Mohape were absolutely unknown to Mr Mohape. They could have been known to Mr Mohape, and these people were wearing balaclavas. \n\tWe also know that the Security Branch were in some way above the law. They had a way of preventing prosecutions when they wanted to prevent them, so they could have taken the risk, knowing that if they failed they would cover it up.\n\tMr Chairman, the other matter which I would like to deal with is Mr Papi's matter. Before I go to that, Mr De Jager had asked me about the personal ill feelings between Mr Mohape and Mr Ngo. I think the suggestion that there was personal malice between the two of them is not justified by evidence. Both of them testified that 'we did not have differences which were personal as such'. What created difficulties was that it emerged at some stage that the one was in one camp and the other was in another. Mr Chairman, you can't describe that as personal malice.\n\tThe next matter is 2.7, the murder of the activist Papi. Mr Ngo describes this incident, and this Papi, or JJ, is not known to him by any other name. There is no-one who corroborates him on this incident and no suggestion can be made that he made this application in order to gain acceptance from his community, or that he conspired with anyone else. This person can simply not be traced.\n\tMr Chairman, insofar as the incident itself is concerned there is no conflicting version and there is no inherent improbability. There is of course the difficulty that he initially implicated Mr Motsamai and later on said he thinks it was Mtyhala and not Motsamai.\n\tI have already said that it seems to me that if we are satisfied that Mr Ngo participated in an incident and he does not waiver as far as the incident is concerned, where we find difficulties about the names of the people that he implicates, the finding should be that he has disclosed that he committed an offence with certain other people.

That would explain his application where he says that he was told that he went to bomb the house of Makubalo. Later it was pointed out to him that he was wrong, at the time he was still a student, the house that was burnt was not the house of Mr Makubalo, but it was the house of Citi Mzuzwana.\n\tAgain, Mr Motsamai has made an application in respect of the house of the parental home of Citi Mzuzwana where in he says he was with Ngo. That tends to explain that on one occasion Mr Ngo did something relating to the Mzuzwana's and he was in the company of Mr Mzuzwana.

            "That is correct, Mr Chairman. I agree their evidence was in fact that they did not recall the incident.\n\tThe next matter I would like to deal with is the matter involving the bombing of the clinic, that is 2.4. Mr Chairman, Mr Ngo again finds some corroboration in his description of this incident from Motsamai who says that on the occasion when they went to bomb the clinic, along the way to Brandfort he saw Ramoseou's car parked in the - facing in the direction of Brandfort. That is some corroboration for Ngo who says that he was with Ramosoeu and Bester in a vehicle and they were there to make sure that the house, the clinic was bombed.\n\tMr Chairman, I do not want to add anything this to application unless of course there are some questions about the evidence regarding the bombing of the clinic.\n\tThe next incident that I am dealing with is 2.16, the conspiracy to murder Khotoi. Mr Ngo, as I have already pointed out, was only with the Bloemfontein police as a policeman for a period of three months. He would not have had intimate knowledge of their affairs outside Bloemfontein before that, and the fact that he knows about the two persons, Pitso and Ntsoabole, whom he says were informers of Ramosoeu, tends to strengthen his evidence. That must be seen in the light of the fact that Ramosoeu was not in Bloemfontein but was in Brandfort. Ngo tells us that these people were informers.\n\tRamosoeu had told us that no, he never keeps informers but he only kept contacts. However, he then said, when confronted about these two people, Pitso and Tsalo, 'no, I only tried to recruit one of them as an informer'.\n\tMr Chairman, it is clear that Mr Ramosoeu was not being truthful about whether he kept informers or not. It was pointed out to him that a contact is not a person who gives information deliberately, but someone who is somehow tricked into giving information. And his answer was not in the negative; it was a matter of saying, 'well, I don't know that'. Mr Chairman, he is an experienced policeman, he should have been able to say that no, a contact is not that type of person but a contact is this and that type of person, or that we don't have any name for that type of person, but he did not do that.\n\tNgo would not have known or have the slightest idea that Ramosoeu even tried to recruit this person as an informer because Ngo was not working in Brandfort on his version. because Ngo never worked with him so how could then Ngo have come to know that Ramosoeu in particular had something to do with Pitso and Ntsoabole? The evidence of Ramosoeu compel us to accept the evidence of Ngo.\n\tMr Chairman, I now wish to deal with the matters 2.9 to 2.12 - 2.8 to 2.12. These I have lumped as the Mamelodi incidents. On all these matters the only evidence which we have about how the houses were burnt is that of Ngo. There has not been any denial that the houses were not burnt.",

            "I concede that, for instance, you could not say that you accept that a policeman acted unlawfully once the he then acted unlawfully every time. So would I say that the fact that you have evidence that Ngo at some stage bombed his girlfriend's house, you can't then infer that he must have bombed the other houses as well for personal reasons. As the Chair pleases.\n\tMr Chairman, what counts in favour of Ngo in this matter is that initially he had included the attack on the house of Sandra Matabata, but when he got the opportunity to explain that he did not burn that house for political - as a result of his being employed as a policeman, he pointed that out. The correction was made even before he gave evidence in his second application, and there is no suggestion that anyone pressured him, or pressurised him to withdraw that application. So what it means is that Ngo removed the incident that was not corrected before yourselves and we remained with those matters that are corrected before yourselves. As I have said, there is no competing version on how the incidents occurred.\n\tNgo's evidence and suggestion that he did these things within the course and scope of his employment as a policeman attached to the Security Branch finds some corroboration from the fact that Captain Loots who came to testify here, denied ever having seen Ngo except for a few minutes, and that he saw him once. It was pointed out to Loots that, 'You had been told that you had gained a good impression, as you said, during the interview; you had gained a good impression of this young man and you wanted him, but from that day you never took any steps to recruit him. This was not compatible with the fact that you needed him'. Secondly, he tried to explain that he had nothing to do with Ngo because there was a shortage of staff. However, it was attempted to make the Committee believe that Ngo did not work with the Security Branch but instead worked with Koja and Koja only. As it turned out from an inspection of the pocketbooks, Mr Ngo had been to the Security Branch on many occasions. He had gone to see Captain Loots; he had gone to see a certain Nieuwoudt and on another occasion he had gone with Bokaba for what was called a place location. We were told that this place location was a form of orientation of a recruit when introducing him to the area where he is going to operate. Capt. Bokaba did not say that there is no such thing. He said that he is not aware of such a name, and one would have expected a policeman of his seniority to have said, well, I recall that type of procedure X. He did not offer an alternative name, and when Ngo made those entries in his book he did not know that he would come before yourselves and ask for amnesty. It was a record which was kept in the course of ordinary business.\n\tMr Chairman, Mr Ngo also showed an intimate knowledge of what was called Horse. In an attempt to oppose Mr Ngo's application, Loots and Bokaba denied that Security Branch had anything to do with an office such as Horse. Now one would wonder why Security Branch would not have had an interest in an office such as that one, that no-one would have got reports from that office and that no member of the Security Branch would have gone into that office. That makes me believe that the attempt to say Security Branch was not involved with Horse was motivated by a desire to deny that Ngo was associated with the Security Branch because Loots and Bokaba knew that Ngo whilst involved with Security Branch had committed these offences.\n\tAgain, Mr Chairman, some suggestion was made that Ngo could not have been with the Security Branch because he was stationed at Mamelodi police station and working there has a housekeeper. However, his pocketbook showed that for a considerable time Ngo was working at Tembisa, despite the fact that it appeared that he was working at Mamelodi.\n\tMr Chairman, I do not know how committed you are to taking the lunch adjournment.",

            "Mr Chairman, I wish to deal with the matter of Mr Venter. It is common cause that Mr Venter - that Mr Ngo was an informer handled by Erasmus. On the version of Mr Ngo, he was introduced to Mr Venter by Mr Erasmus. However, Mr Erasmus has denied having introduced Mr Ngo to Mr Venter. One finds this denial difficult to accept. Firstly, Ngo was an informer of Mr Erasmus on matters occurring in black townships and black schools. Mr Ngo then moves, apparently without notifying his handler, to another address. He then leaves that address and later he informs the handler that 'I am leaving to a different place now, you must come and see me there'. I find that improbable; one would expect that the Security Branch would require of their informers to remain where they are and when they have to leave, when the leave the place where they are living to at least inform them that they are about to change their addresses.\n\tMr Chairman, one also would expect the Security Branch to want to know the type of person their informer is living with. That would then have prompted Mr Erasmus to make some enquiries about Mr Venter. From what he told us he was not bothered at all. That is an improbability in my submission. I am sorry to repeat then; one would expect that some enquiry about Mr Venter should have been made.\n\tOn the other hand, Mr Ngo gives a plausible explanation for his living at Venter's house. He says, 'I was living in the township until the day I became exposed; from that day onwards the Security Branch decided that I should live with Mr Venter'. That's the most plausible explanation. Mr Venter was a white person, removed from the black townships and it could not have been easy for schoolchildren to reach Mr Ngo at Mr Venter's house. So on this aspect the probabilities favour Ngo. This probability is strengthened by the fact that despite the fact that an allegation was made very early that two members of the Security Branch took Ngo to Mr Venter's house, when Mr Erasmus testified it did not appear he took any steps to ask from members of the Security Branch, 'who of you, by the way, took Ngo to Mr Venter's house?' Secondly, none of the persons who testified here and were implicated by Mr Ngo, said that they ever took Mr Ngo to Mr Venter's house.\n\tMr Chairman, in my submission, if Ngo had been simply incorrect about the identity of the persons who took him there, we would have expected some correction.\n\tIt was suggested that Mr Ngo went to live there because he was a gardener and helped in the house. Mr Chairman, I find this to be somewhat difficult to believe. At that stage Ngo was a schoolchild. I am not aware, since the time I was born, of anyone who employs a gardener who is a student fulltime, or one who employs a man to do internal domestic work like washing dishes and so on. I am not aware of those things.\n\tSome suggestion was made by Mr Erasmus that Mr Ngo apparently had a homosexual relationship with Mr Venter. Mr Chairman, if you look at the affidavit submitted on behalf of Mr Erasmus, it is in chronological order. If you have listened to the evidence as a whole, you will see that at the time when he made the affidavit he intended to lead us to believe that he had discovered that Mr Ngo had a homosexual relationship with Mr Venter before the trial. If we look at how the incidents are put there, the trial emerges much later.\nThe impression that one gets is that he discovered before Ngo went to Pretoria that he had a homosexual relationship with ...[intervention]",

In fact, there is something odd about the claim that Mr Ngo was suspended at the time because the very objectors sent a Mr Kojo to come and tell us that, 'no, I worked with Mr Ngo until he left'. That Mr Kojo would not say that Mr Ngo was suspended at that time. And that Mr Kojo, it turned out, had last seen Mr Ngo around July, on his evidence. In his evidence he had said that Mr Ngo had deserted him and it turned out that he could not then explain how he could say that he was with him at all times and how, if Mr Ngo had deserted him on the 21st July 1988, that on 22nd July 1988 he was already working with Ramala.\n\tIn my view, Mr Chairman, that totality of evidence shows a conspiracy to deny that Ngo was a member of the Security Branch and was working with the Security Branch, and was instructed by members of the Security Branch to come and kill Mr Venter.",

In December and January, especially January and early February there is no suggestion that he was around; he probably had been in Pretoria at the time.\n\tMr Chairman, the next aspect is the evidence of Mr Ngo regarding how the body was disposed of. This is a very difficult aspect of the application. It is clear that no submission can ever made that the explanation was satisfactory.\tThe next question is, how does that affect his application to make a full disclosure? I would venture to suggest that in these circumstances one must ask oneself whether Ngo deliberately attempted to conceal his involvement in the disposal of the body. In my submission there is substantial compliance with the requirement of full disclosure in this regard in that, despite the fact that he is not satisfactory - his evidence is not satisfactory on matters such as how there came to be a wire and on matters such as whether the brothers would not have been surprised by the wire around Mr Venter's neck, in my submission these are matters which are related to detail rather than matters that relate to an unwillingness to involve one's involvement in the commission of an offence. I want to suggest, Mr Chairman, that you should imagine the situation if, for instance, Mr Venter's whereabouts were not known at the time when the application was made. His evidence would have allowed you to reach and find Mr Venter's body and know where it was disposed of. All in all what I am saying is, Mr Ngo gave a full account of what occurred to Mr Venter from the moment when he shot him right up to the moment when Mr Venter was found.\n\tMr Chairman, in weighing the evidence as a whole, one must have regard to the fact that there has been this general pattern of denial of all incidents or most of the incidents in all material respects by the police. It is improbable that Mr Motsamai incorrectly implicated any of the policemen. The denials of the police must be seen in the light of the fact that it is known that during the era in which these things are alleged to have occurred by Ngo and Motsamai, the police themselves have admitted that the situation had become such that legal means of suppressing resistance were not sufficient and the had to resort to unconventional means. One does not have any reason to understand why the police in Bloemfontein would have been immune from this pressure and the temptation to do something, something which might be illegal. Their denials anyway are not borne out by the evidence that has been led in these applications.\n\tMr Chairman, lastly, in the assessment of the evidence of Mr Ngo generally one must recall that these things occurred today about 14 or 15 years ago, starting from the 1984 incident. Most of these incidents appear to have occurred within the space of about two to three months only, and it appears that in that short space of time Mr Ngo did an awful lot in both senses of the word, and some of the inconsistencies of his evidence should be understood in that context. Those are my submissions, Mr Chairman.",

The one is the requirements of the Act and the other is of course the evidence. I'm not going today to discuss the evidence with you, but what we intend to do is to approach our argument to you on those two bases, and if I may say that in regard to the first section, the question of the requirements of the Act, we believe that what is important there is to draw your attention to what precise measure of proof or standard of evidence it will be expected of an applicant to give before this Committee. Then, most importantly, what is the precise basis of the applications now before you on the evidence of the applicants. That will entail, Mr Chairman, the question of whether both applicants at all times could have been regarded as 'member of the Security Force'. Then, of course, the last aspect in that regard is that there is also the qualification that the acts or offence had to be directed against, and then the sections are set out.\n\tAs far as the evidence is concerned, Mr Chairman, we will on paper present to you the dissecting of the evidence un der four headings; first of all, matters which are common cause, which will search through the records and placed before you. Secondly and tying in with that, matters which are objective facts which cannot be denied and must be accepted. Thirdly, we will discuss the probabilities which my learned friend Mr Stander has done this morning, and my learned friend Mr Memani. Lastly we will deal with the credibility of witnesses.\n\tMr Chairman, I'm only going to deal with the first aspect, the requirements of the Act to lay some thoughts in your midst as to how this matter, according to our submission, ought to be approached.\n\tFirst of all, as to what standard of proof has to be put before you, Mr Chairman, of course the Act is silent. The Act speaks in s 20 that the Committee must be satisfied. That begs the question, of course. Does one apply the normal standard of the balance of probabilities, or is it something less? We would submit, Mr Chairman, that most appropriately the ordinary accepted standard of proof on balance of probabilities should be the most acceptable standard if only by reason of the fact that it has been applied for many, many years and that there is some clarity about what standard of proof entails.\n\tWe know from our case law in all matters which allowed for a discretion to be exercised upon a person being satisfied or a judge being satisfied, there have been legal arguments and there has been a diversity of opinion. What the Act says is, you must be satisfied. We say, Mr Chairman, it could be on a balance of probabilities or something less. It is going to be something less, then of course it depends on the person to person and how each person sees a certain situation. We will address you on that basis, that it is perhaps something less.

Now that is perfectly acceptable, and then it depends on whether that is the evidence which you accept at the end of the day. But, Mr Chairman, ass far as Mr Ngo is concerned, my learned friend has this problem. Mr Ngo, we know, becomes a policeman on 10 February 1986. We know on the evidence before you that he was suspended on 2 January 1989. \n\tNow without splitting hairs, Mr Chairman, a policeman who is on suspension cannot claim that he then can act in the course and scope of his duty. It is a logical argument. Logic would have it that he can't say that.\n\tWhat we say is this, Mr Chairman, and this my learned friend Mr Memani has neglected to do. The applicant, Mr Ngo, would have to convince you on each and everyone of his applications that they fell within that period of time.",

Oh well, this was the general, he gave the instruction for whoever to be eliminated. That is the top of the scale.
