The first stamp is one obviously stamped by the South African authorities and that is done, apparently, in terms of Section 6(2) and/or Section 35(2) of the Aliens Control Act 1991, that is Act 96/91.  I wanted to draw your attention to the fact, Chairperson, that there is no space for a name on this stamp, clearly because it is meant to go into a passport and the name of the person would appear from the passport.  There's only a space for conditions, which was left blank here.  The place was left blank, etcetera, so it would seem that you could enter Lesotho at any border post.\n\tFrom the South African side and into the South African side with that stamp, and the same goes for the Lesotho one, which does not specify any revision of any Act, but simply gives the dates and it is signed by, or it's proposed to be signed by the Director of Immigration, and it simply says that the entry and exists will be between the hours of 06H00 in the morning to 22H00 in the evening.

If you look at paragraph 6, the third sentence from the end of the paragraph he mentions you.  I don't know if Mr Visser could be kind enough to just show you what I'm talking about.  And I think it's more clearer if you go to page 43, at the top there, he says\n\"During the same year, 1986, myself, Mike, Jantjie, Koki, Thulo, Jackie Tsolo, Celo, Colin Robertshaw, Capt Fouche and Lieut du Plessis, left for Lesotho.  We kidnapped the ANC Chief Representative, Mr Mageta.  We handed him over to Tsolo and Celo, who later crossed with him.  Myself, Koki, Thulo and Mike Jantjie went to Ditabaneng to collect a certain Lesotho soldier working for the South Africans.\"\nSo what I'm just asking you here is that, are you certain that you joined in 1987, this unit, or you worked with this unit during 1986?   Or you've forgotten the years?",
