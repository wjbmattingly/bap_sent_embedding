<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLOBO:</span> I was a member of the ANC and I was also a marshal inside the movement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> What were your functions as the marshal of the ANC at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLOBO:</span> My work includes when we have meetings we should always let people be in order, and that's the work of the marshals that if there's one comrade who has passed away we collect monies for condolences.

<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a>words could we say there was a senior marshal, a junior marshal or a commanding marshal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLOBO:</span> Marshals are put in different positions, we have commanders respectively in terms of seniority and in terms of their duties.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Now where do you place yourself in terms of rank as a marshal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLOBO:</span> I was always a committee member and I was also helping the committee in executing their duties, and I was just a general marshal working under general instructions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Did you have any powers as a marshal to give instructions or orders or any directive to members of the ANC there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLOBO:</span> I had more power to give instructions in my work as a marshal, particularly our leader who was Manong and Mr Mayekiso, they would come to me and give me some instructions to carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Are you saying that you would receive instructions from the ANC leadership, amongst others being Mr Manong and Mr Mayekiso?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLOBO:</span> That's true Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> And what would you then do with the instructions given to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLOBO:</span> (No interpretation given)</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> On the date of the incident, September 1990, when the four White persons were killed, you were present at the scene.</p>

<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a>MR MPSHE	40	MR HLOBO</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a>took an iron rod and hit those people whilst other people were assaulting them I was taking part also.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> And when did you arrive on the scene?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLOBO:</span> The car arrived whilst I was still there, that is when we heard the car parking next to the shelter house.  We went out of that house and then we found people already gathered and they were surrounding a car near that house. Then I paved my way to go right in the circle next to the car, then it was a Pulsar make, inside were two people at the back and then in front was a man and a woman and I asked them what do you want in the location?   Then the people who were at the back told me that they were looking shebeens and they were looking for women.  Then I asked them again as whether they have guns, then they told me that they don't have guns.  Then I gave instructions that the comrades should kill those people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Can you repeat the instruction you gave?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLOBO:</span> Whilst I was still at the car I asked these people ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> No, no, the instruction you gave you say (repeats line in Sotho)</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLOBO:</span> I gave instructions that the comrades should kill those people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> In what capacity then were you giving this instruction to the comrades?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLOBO:</span> I was giving instructions while I was still with those people who were killed.  I was on the scene at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Let me put it this way.  Why did you give an instruction or an order that they be killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLOBO:</span> I was able to detect that the situation in which BLOEMFONTEIN HEARING	AMNESTY/FREE STATE</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a>MR MPSHE	41	MR HLOBO</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a>we were in at that time was tense, the situation was tense, because in Kothlanong township in Odendaalsrus Inkatha Freedom Party was coming to attack the comrades, then I took it that these people are coming to attack the comrades, because they came to Mashengoville and they are coming to attack therefore I decided that we should attack them first before they attacked us because they came at night, they came around eight o'clock at night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Now when did you know that your area was going to be attacked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLOBO:</span> It was on a Monday because some of them - there were men, three men who came to me who were members of the Russian gang that on Sunday was a meeting at Mr Sithole's house together with the Russians and the Inkatha members and they told me on Monday around three o'clock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Now let us go to - let us concentrate on the time before the incident, before the killings, before the killings did you have any information that the area was going to be attacked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLOBO:</span> Yes I did have information that our area is going to be attacked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> And how did you know, how did you receive that information?  In other words who told you and where was this told?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLOBO:</span> I got this information on Wednesday at seven o'clock, I was at home, one of the comrades came to my house who is Mabanjo, then he said to me Comrade Thami people have been attacked in the squatter camps, I was still eating at the time, then I left my food there then we went outside.  When we arrived outside I asked him as whether he has a whistle then he said yes he had it, and then he pulled it</p>

<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a>MR MPSHE	42	MR HLOBO</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a>out, I took his whistle then I blew it, because we were the comrades.  The way we were calling each was using the whistles, and those who were near came and we gathered.  Then we discussed among ourselves that we should go to the squatter camp.  Inside the squatter camps we saw people gathered around armed with dangerous weapons and the police were there.  That's where we took a decision then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Yes Mr Chairman.  Mr Matela testified about a meeting which was addressed by Mr Manong before the incident, do you know about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLOBO:</span> I know fully about that meeting that Mr Manong was briefing us about informations before, days before this incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Were you present at that meeting addressed by Mr Manong?</p>

<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLOBO:</span> Mr Manong explained that because there are people coming to attack us and who are Inkatha members we should protect ourselves in whatever way possible to protect ourselves.  That is the address he gave at the meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Now in this, pertaining to this incident, what did you as the marshal who gave an instruction that the people be killed, what did you expect to gain or to benefit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR HLOBO:</span> I am asking that you repeat the question Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> What did you expect to gain or to benefit or to achieve from the killings of the four people?</p>
