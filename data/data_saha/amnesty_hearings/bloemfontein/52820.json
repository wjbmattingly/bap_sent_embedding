I have been fighting until he came here on Monday, released to be here on Monday.  So that is the reason I couldn't obtain an affidavit and prepare properly for him.  Mr Chairman, his evidence will only be the supply of weapons from Umtata to Welkom.",

Even in Ficksburg Africans were killed by Boers in that \"One taxi, one bullet\" and the taxi was shot at.  And another thing, children who were working very hard on the farms from their mother's wombs, working very hard, pregnant women working very hard.  Until labour they were working very hard, during pregnancy until labour.  \n\tShe never got a chance to go to school and get educated just like other people.  The life of people here in the Free State, more especially in the farms that belonged to the Boers, and these Boers were members of the AWB on the farms.\n\tIn 1992 in the Transkei, 1990 if I can remember well, where AWB members were training people to overthrow the Transkei Government.
