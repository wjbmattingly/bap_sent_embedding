            "We arrived at Stormberg Farm, the farm belonging to Mr Fourie.  Reaching that place we stopped at the gate just in front of the house on that farm.  The gate itself was in a place, sort of a bush, there were a lot of trees around there.  We stayed there for about, a short while, but it can be about two hours if I estimate.  But before that, before we reached the gate that I am explaining about, we saw his car moving out of the yard.  He seemed to be a person going about his business.  He came back and found us there at the gate, together with his wife in that car.  As he arrived there he alighted from the car trying to open the gates.  That is where he was attacked, I mean shot.  He was shot by comrade Leeuw.  After having shot him it was necessary that we take him into the bush that I've explained about next to the gate as you enter into the farm yard.  After pulling him off the road I was with comrade Magoda.  I participated by searching his pockets and I found a wallet in his pockets.  After that I went back to the car where it was still - where inside this car there was this lady who was in his company.  We took this woman along and went to the house.\n\tAs we arrived at the house comrade Leeuw opened the door by the keys he found from this woman.  He found the keys in her handbag.  The fact is we went inside and we searched Mr Fourie's house.  We found what we were instructed to get there.  Things that might be necessary for the organisation according to the command that we received from the person who was responsible for the task force.\n\tSo we found the car, clothing, money that we could not use and the rest we could use.   We were able to get some goods ...(intervention)",

The objective being to establish Operation Great Storm which was linked with these task forces and APLA as it is because it was APLA's responsibility, it was to be used by task force.  This was the call that was made over the radio, so that it's operations focus on the farms only, against the farmers, the reason being, or the other reason was what we tried to achieve as the organisation explained of the outcry of Africans that the land must go back to its rightful owners.
