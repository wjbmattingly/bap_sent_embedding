I will start from paragraph 8.\n\tNo at the time when you entered House No. 1663, D Section are you certain that there were no people in the yard as well as in the house?\nINSP. DE LA REY: Yes, that is correct. There was no-one except for a young boy,  he was a scholar,  he was outside of the house and there was no-one within the house.\nADV. MTHEMBU: Or more a less, could you estimate how old was this scholar that you found in the yard?\nINSP. DE LA REY: If I can remember correctly, it was in the region of 10 or 12 years.\nADV. MTHEMBU: And did you enquire from him if there were people in the house or not?\nINSP. DE LA REY: The house was not locked, I went through the house and then I found myself that there was no-one there.\nADV. MTHEMBU: The question is, did you enquire from the scholar if there was any person in the house or not?\nINSP. DE LA REY: That is correct, he said that there wasn't anyone in the house and then I just made sure for myself that there wasn't anyone.\nADV. MTHEMBU: Why did you say in your statement that \"I enquired from the scholar if there was anyone in the house and he said no and then I proceeded to inspect the house myself\"?\nINSP. DE LA REY: Can you please repeat the question, I don't understand it.\nADV. MTHEMBU: I am saying why is it contained in your statement that \"I enquired from a scholar that I found in the yard if there was anyone in the house or not\"?\nINSP. DE LA REY: At that stage I didn't mention it in my statement because I didn't think it was important because it was a child who was a minor.\nADV. MTHEMBU: Because accused No. 1's version is that when you arrived at House No. 1663 that he was in the yard in the company of two other persons, do you have any comment to make with that statement?\nINSP. DE LA REY: That is correct. Accused No. 1 was not on the property of the concerned house, later during the investigation I established he was noticed some distance from the house where he was standing with some other persons.\nADV. MTHEMBU: In paragraph 11, you say that Sgt. Constable Yankee shouted that there were persons who were running away and you say that one of these people or persons that were running away was accused No. 1, Mr May. On what basis do you make that statement or assumption if you say accused No. 1 was standing with two other people at a distance from the house?\nINSP. DE LA REY: Mr Chairperson, after Sgt. Jantjie had alarmed me, some of the people, the bystanders stopped accused No. 1 and arrested him, they handed him over to me and later Jantjie identified accused No. 1 as one of the persons who he had been seen to have run away.\nADV. MTHEMBU: Is it correct that when you arrived at this house that you drove inside the yard with your motor vehicle?\nINSP. DE LA REY: At that point the vehicle which I was using was one loaned by a Constable Jantjie, my vehicle was definitely not inside the yard, but it is possible that some of the vehicles of other members could have been in the yard at the time.",

MTHEMBU: That is correct.\n\tIt was accused No. 1 says that when the other two people ran away, they did so from the yard, but he didn't do so and when you confront him he was inside the yard not as you have put it on your statement.\nINSP. DE LA REY: Mr Chairperson, that is simply not true it is not so that accused No. 1 was in the yard. That is not true.\nADV. MTHEMBU: Accused No. 2, sorry, accused No. 1 further says that he had no injuries on his wrist but that the injuries were on his thighs and somewhere on his buttock.\nINSP. DE LA REY: Mr Chairperson, accused No. 1 did have some old injuries apart from those on his wrists - I beg your pardon on both of his wrists.\nADV. MTHEMBU: Now, the articles mentioned in paragraph 13, are you certain that all these articles belonged to the deceased?\nINSP. DE LA REY: Mr Chairperson, I am very sure about the brown wallet and the cash in the wallet, the dollar notes contained therein and the card with personal particulars of the deceased person as well as the gold men's watch which I removed from accused No. 1's arm and also the personal particulars of the deceased were noted there, the other Husky Denim wallet I cannot remember perhaps I can just refresh my memory and look at the identified property list. Mr Chairperson, it seems to me as though the blue denim wallet, the Husky wallet was not identified as being the property of the deceased.\nADV. MTHEMBU: And you will not deny the fact that the blue denim Husky purse belonged to accused No. 1. Is that correct?\nINSP. DE LA REY: That is correct, I cannot deny that.\nADV. MTHEMBU: And you further confirm that the manner in which these articles are set out in paragraph 13 one gets the impression that all of these articles belonged to the deceased?\nINSP. DE LA REY: What I am positively sure of is the brown wallet, that was identified positively, it is difficult for somebody to identify cash but because the cash was in the wallet and there was a card with the personal particulars of the deceased on it that was also in the wallet and therefore it was identified as being the property of the deceased. The watch very definitely, yes, because his initials and surname were also on the watch and that is why it was identified positively as being the property of the deceased. All that I can say is that the cash will be difficult to prove that it was the deceased.\nADV. MTHEMBU: Furthermore inspector, when you, when accused No. 1 was arrested, was he or was he not wearing a leather jacket? Can you still remember?\nINSP. DE LA REY: Yes, I can remember, Mr Chairperson, at the stage when he was arrested by the bystanders and handed over to me he did not have on a leather jacket.\nADV. MTHEMBU: But accused No. 1 says that when you arrested him, you asked him, you personally asked him to remove the leather jacket because you had no money and could not afford one. Did you say that to him?\nINSP. DE LA REY: That is not true at all. At no stage he didn't have a leather jacket on so I couldn't have searched it.\nADV. MTHEMBU: Accused No. 1, further says that the brown wallet that you are referring to, paragraph 13.1 and paragraph 13.3 that these items you found in the car and only the item listed in paragraph 13.2 was found on his person.\nINSP. DE LA REY: That is not correct, Mr Chairperson.\nADV. MTHEMBU: Sgt. van der Watt, did he tell you where he had got hold of the articles mentioned in paragraph 14?\nINSP.

MTHEMBU: My question to the Inspector is that when he went to Mr May, didn't you already have information and that addresses of the suspects that you were looking for and it was merely for Mr May to direct you to the respective houses?\nINSP.

I hadn't got any suspects in the case up to that stage before arresting Mr May so I didn't have any addresses and I really didn't have any addresses of the accused.",

            ": As I understand your evidence, it was the car you found, not Mr May. Mr May then appeared on the scene when he started running away and that is when you got him. It was the car that you found at that address which you then identified as a stolen vehicle?\nINSP. DE LA REY: That is correct Mr Chairperson. The car that actually led us to arresting accused No. 1 and the other persons. After I found the car there and identified it as being the accused missing vehicle that is where the whole thing originated, from there the arrests of 1, 2, 3 and 4 followed.\nADV. MTHEMBU: On paragraph 17, Inspector, Mr Nkgwedi and Mr Leeuw, they deny that they gave you information to go to House No. 3269 but that the information relating to accused No. 4 was given to you by Mr May?\nINSP. DE LA REY: Mr Chairperson, accused 1, 2 and 3 gave me information and the address 1684 K. Accused 4 was not found there and there we were given a report that he was at another house visiting and another person then led us to address 3269. In that house accused 1, 2 and 3 then took me to the home of the accused No. 4 although at that stage he wasn't there somebody else we found at the house took us to this other address where we then found accused No. 4.\nADV. MTHEMBU: At that stage, Inspector, where you aware if money had also being taken during the robbery or not?\nINSP. DE LA REY: That is correct, Mr Chairperson. There was a sum of money and if I remember it was about R500.00 in cash that was taken during the robbery.\nADV. MTHEMBU: And when accused No. 4 was arrested you found the sum of R102.85c in his person. Is that correct?\nINSP. DE LA REY: That is correct, Mr Chair.\nADV. MTHEMBU: And did you ask him whose money it was?\nINSP. DE LA REY: I did ask him and that is how I also took possession of it because it was mentioned to me that it was money coming from the deceased house and on the grounds of that I seized this money.\nADV. MTHEMBU: Accused No. 4 says that it was his personal money and it had nothing to do with the money taken from the house during the robbery.\nINSP. DE LA REY: That is not right. Accused No. 4 told me that it was money which they had found in the deceased house and that is why I then confiscated the money. He did not tell me that it was his personal property.\nADV. MTHEMBU: When Elizabeth Nglani handed over to you the blue plastic bag were the accused present or not?\nINSP. DE LA REY: At that stage it was just accused No. 3's wife who was in the house because the space was very limited and it wasn't possible to have everybody in the house. She went in and made a report and the goods were handed over to us.\nADV. MTHEMBU: All the four applicants say that they do not know where you found this blue plastic bag and avail that this plastic bag was also in the car?\nINSP. DE LA REY: Mr Chairperson, that is not so, the bag was with accused No. 3's common-law wife that was at home 469 E and we came out with the bag and the accused must have seen the bag at that point because the evidence had been identified and marked already and placed in the vehicle and accused No. 3 was in the vehicle at the time so he must have seen this bag with us.\nADV.

For instance, articles 21 (4) and (5) on reading your statement, one gets the impression that these also formed part of items removed from the deceased's farm.\nINSP. DE LA REY: No, I cannot agree. A full list has been compiled. It was filed and it has been attached to the charge sheet because these persons appeared in court. There was property which was missing and there was property which was recovered, so I cannot agree that it is misleading because in the file and in the possession of the court and the documents which were handed in there, this list of property which was missing and recovered was given and all the evidence relevant to that matter was submitted in court and it was tabled there so in my opinion it is not misleading.",

At a later stage after we had sorted out all the evidence and the articles, she came to my office to identify the items which concerned her. At the stage of the arrests, as you will know it is impossible to take a witness with you when you are busy arresting somebody because it can be a very dangerous situation.\nADV. MTHEMBU: . . . (inaudible) groceries was not in the boot as the accused say and if the groceries was in the house in the kitchen as you say, how could you possibly identify grocery as belonging to the deceased and not to the household concerned?\nINSP. DE LA REY: Mr Chairperson, at all the different houses and it is not only one particular house where groceries were found and confiscated, it is coincidental that the deceased had gone to do shopping on the same day which he was murdered and it had been at one specific supermarket where he had done his shopping and all those which I found had the same labels the same boutiques of the shopping centre and that immediately confirmed to me that these were the groceries of the deceased and that is why I didn't confiscate those ones. The deceased and the lady who stayed with the deceased also identified this as property which articles which they had bought the same day, so it wasn't just one house where there were groceries it was at the house of accused No. 3's common-law wife's mother and also 337 K as well as accused 1's brother's house, so the kind of articles which I found and confiscated were the same as those which the deceased had bought that day that he was murdered and it is on that basis that the articles were identified as being the deceased property.\nADV. MTHEMBU: So, you had fore knowledge that the deceased had bought some groceries from a well known supermarket?\nINSP. DE LA REY: Yes, that is correct. During the investigation one does a lot of inquiries and we found out from the people that had gone to buy groceries that specific day and Mrs May also told me at a later stage that they had gone to get groceries in Bloemfontein. That is the whole reason why they wanted to come to Bloemfontein on that particular day of the murder, to buy groceries, so I did know more or less what I was looking for but I could see that firearms were missing from the safe after going through the identify document of the deceased. I knew there had to be groceries because they had gone to buy groceries.\nADV. MTHEMBU: And before of that fore knowledge when you got into the various houses, and you found some groceries with the label from that well known supermarket, you suspected that that could have well have been groceries that had been bought by the deceased?\nINSP.

DE LA REY: That is correct. Mr May's particular's, her husband's particulars, I can't remember exactly but there were those particulars on them. It is unfortunate so that in the bags of groceries there were other things which could be identified positively as belonging to the deceased or Mrs May.\nADV. MTHEMBU: . . .

Did that pillow have any distinguishing marks for you to say that it belonged to the deceased?\nINSP. DE LA REY: The reason why I confiscated this particular pillow was because accused No. 2 handed it to me along with the shoes and he said it was part of the property which had been taken from the deceased's home and that is why I also took the pillow because he gave it to me with the shoes and later it was identified positively as being the deceased's property.\nADV. MTHEMBU: But Inspector, Mr Nkgwedi says that the pair of brown shoes were his. He said that in modus operandi, in that bedroom, at house No. 337, was that anything that you saw as being new or as being of quality, you just said it could not belong to them. It could only be the late Mr Fourie's property.\nINSP. DE LA REY: That is not correct Mr Chairperson. The accused at No. 337 K and all the other cases voluntarily, I asked them what they had taken and it was just part of investigation, you ask people what else they took from the deceased's home and then the accused gets it out and as he took out the pillow and the shoes, accused No. 3 again took out the knife from the bag and it was after what I had asked them that they handed these articles to me. It is not so that I said yes because it is an expensive article it can't belong to them, that is not correct.\nADV. MTHEMBU: The applicants say that after the arrest of accused No. 4, Mr Magoda, that you actually didn't go back to House 337, but that instead you went to K Section at Leon Bottle Store where you went to go and buy liquor and from there you went to Bloemfontein. I am sorry.\nINSP. DE LA REY: Mr Chairperson, that is not at all true, as I have in my statement, you will notice that the course of time which expired was brief and to move between sections takes a lot of time and if you look at the time which expired there wasn't time to do other things, it was a matter of moving front one point to another and then back to that point. That kept us busy, there wasn't time for other things.\nADV. MTHEMBU: The articles mentioned in paragraph 21, Mr May says that he didn't provide you with any information but that these articles were found by the police in the vehicle.\nINSP. DE LA REY: Could you please repeat your question.

Now before even going to effect further arrests of the other accused or applicants why did you not search House No. 1663 to find if you will find any articles that are connected or linked with articles removed from Mr Fourie's farm?\nINSP. DE LA REY: Mr Chairperson, at that stage I already had evidence such as the watches, the firearms which accused No. 1 could be related to the charge and I found from experience that if you delay too much at one particular place in the day before starting to look for the other persons then evidence disappears because their bush telegram is running fast and then the evidence can be lost and the suspects can escape so we acted immediately, you will notice at 337 K after we arrested accused 2 and 3 there, we locked the house with the purpose of first going to look for the other suspects and after we had found all the suspects then we went back to the houses and then we confiscated the other items, so it was just to save time to get hold of the other people that we did this.\nADV. DE JAGER: Mr De la Rey, you have been asked what Sgt. van der Watt gave to you? It's the brown leather bag, the bullets, the firearm?\nINSP. DE LA REY: That is correct.\nADV. DE JAGER: I don't know if it is a dispute, I know it is a hearsay but where would he have got these things.\nINSP. DE LA REY: In the statement of Sgt. van der Watt and what he told me orally, it was quite a distance from the house where the vehicle was found in the vicinity of another house and I think it is probably 200 m, if I can estimate the distance from the house where we were. He found this in another yard, the jacket was lying there, the firearm was under the car.\nADV. MTHEMBU: In view of the fact that the bush telegram goes faster, but not searching House No. 1663 at the time when you arrested Mr May, didn't it occur to you that maybe there will be evidence in that house which could be tampered with if you had to come at a later stage?",

It says\nThe Amnesty Commission Bloemfontein.\n\tTo whom it may concern.\n\tIn connection with the death of our father, Roelof Fourie, who was murdered on the 12th of February 1992, we would like to bring the following facts to the attention of the Amnesty Commission.  \n         We first learned that the four men were convicted of murder, Mr Nkgwedi, Mr Magoda, Mr May and Mr Leeuw who are seeking amnesty from a television item.  We would like the opportunity to tell the court about Roelof Fourie and how he treated his workers.  He built brick houses for all the permanent families on the farm, plus ablution blocks with running hot and cold water.  Local farmers were not in favour of this as this raised expectations amongst their workers.        He also built a school and when he saw the headmaster who was not teaching the students but taking time off, he went to the Education Department and had him replaced with a more reliable teacher.                 \n\tHe gave plants from his garden to those who wanted to set up their own gardens.                              \n\tHe used his prize bulls to breed with the workers' cattle to improve their stock..                         \n\tHe used the farm's vehicles to take the staff shopping on a monthly basis and also transported sick workers to doctors when needed.                                   \n\tHe regularly killed sheep for the staff as well as supplied them with groceries on a monthly basis.       \n\tEvery Christmas he ensured that every member each family resident on the farm received a gift.           \n\tHe built a soccer field for the children.              \n\tRoelof Fourie was a firm but fair man who expected his employees to put in an honest day's work in return for wages which were the highest in the area.  He was not involved in party politics but he was respected for his knowledge on improved farming methods in the area which benefited both inhabitants and the environment.        \n\tIn addition we would like to point our that contrary to his statement the father of Sebula Nkgwedi was still resident and working on the farm Stormberg at the time of the shooting.       We believe the situation has been exploited by those who want their freedom, even if it means changing the facts. At the trial all were given every opportunity to state their motive for their murder and non talked of the PAC operation.  If their political convictions were so great, why did they not state this and why was there no evidence of any political support inside or outside the courtroom or in the newspapers?  Can a case for amnesty be built on lies?\n\tAnother cause for great concern is that Hendrick Leeuw, after he was convicted, turned around in the courtroom and said to Roelof Fourie's grandson, Do you remember me? Yes said the grandson, It's your turn next, I will come and get you Bertrand(?) Hendrick! This was immediately reported to the prosecutor, Mr Hatting.  Nothing further was heard on our side.  Should a man who's already admitted to killing be set free to perhaps carry out his threat in the name of Justice?  We believe that the motive for murder was robbery as the workers believed him to be a rich man.  This is supported that they stole His share certificates, Kruger Rands, a motor vehicle, clothing and household effects. And not for political reasons as has been put forward.                                               \n\tWe would like  you to carefully consider the above facts before granting amnesty to the four men.         \n\tYours sincerely\nThank you Mr Chair.",
