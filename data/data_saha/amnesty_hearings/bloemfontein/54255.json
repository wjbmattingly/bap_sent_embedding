            "Continue.  Then you hired a taxi to Theunissen, ...(indistinct)\nMR PUDUMO\nThe taxi owner said he wanted us to pay R50 to take us to that place and I said to him:  \"Yes, I will give you the money\" and indeed we took a trip.\n\t\tBefore arriving at the place of the attack, we stopped the car and we told him to turn back, not to reach the place where we were going to and I asked my Commander the reason for that.  He told me:  \"These people are here to assist us, they were not trained, they are just here to assist us with taking whatever we will repossess\" and he gave an order that the car should turn back and these people should remain here and the two of us went ahead and he gave them an order, he said:  \"You stand here, you wait here until we tell you to go back or to come and assist us carry the things we are supposed to take.\"  \n\t\tWhen we arrived at the place, we got into a farm.  When we arrived at the farm, we found a girl working at that farm.  I knocked at the door.  When this girl came out, Rasta Moloto talked to her, he said to her he wanted to see the white man.  This girl went into the house to call the white man.  Rasta Moloto said to him:  \"Listen man, you have nothing to say, I am in command here\".  I asked what the reason for that, what if these people they were many people, and he said to me:  \"The language used here is Afrikaans.\"  \n\t\tThe white man approached.  I did not understand what they were talking further but after a few minutes I noticed a white woman coming out of the door.  After her a dog came out.  She tried to stop it, she tried to take it back into the house but it refused, it went outside.  When the white man came out, my commander prepared a firearm to get into the house.  He gave me an order at that stage.  He said:  \"Man, you must be aware now, we are fighting\".  \n\t\tOn our way to this place, we had two firearms.  I had a 38 with me and he had a .22.  Indeed I waited outside, he got into the house pointing a gun at the white woman.  I was left outside with this man.  The woman was making noise to alert the people inside that there was something going on outside.  After a few minutes when they were inside, I heard gunshots.  The white man left me at the door.  When he got inside, I noticed that I was now left on my own.  I managed to shoot at him when he was quite a distance ahead of me.  When I looked in front of me, the person who was with me was already shot, he was lying down there.  I went to fetch him from where he had fallen.  Luckily he had a gunshot wound, but he just slipped and he fell.  I grabbed the gun from him and when I went back towards the door, I saw a young white woman, she had a firearm with her.  I shot her.  Now this person who was with me managed to stand up.  \n\t\tNow on our way back a young white man, a white woman - another white woman was there, she had a shoe, but the heel of the shoe was faced towards - was pointed at me and I noticed that this person wanted to scare us, but the person was approaching.  On passing the first door in the corridor, I noticed two people talking in this room and I had to shoot at this person who was approaching us.  The person who was with me, took the firearm from me and I was left with one firearm.  I asked him:  \"Are you still okay?  Are you still in a well condition to fight?\"  He said:  \"Let us leave this place.\"  I tried to accompany him up to the door, so that we could go outside.  When I turned back, I saw another white person.  Because of the noise and because it was chaotic, I did not even take into consideration who she was, but it was a woman.  After looking at her, she ran back into the house and we managed to get out of the house.  I had to stand at the door for quite some time, so that my injured colleague could walk a distance.  \n\t\tAfter we had left and just close to a hill, he fell.  I got suspicious the way he fell, it looked as if he was loosing energy.  When I looked up there where the road came from, I saw many cars driving down and I had to be safe where I was, I had to run away.  I tried to run to him to check as to whether he was still alive or not, but I could not do that because the cars were approaching fast and they were now very close.  That was my escape.  \n\t\tI did not go to the two people that we left behind, I only noticeD Potsotso passing and I noticed that they were not at the place where they were commanded to stay and we disbursed.

I did not get the answer to the motto, whether the applicant ...\n\tChairperson it's correct what has been said by my colleague that it was not correct, the motto of the PAC itself, serve, suffer, sacrifice, SSS, which of course is basic, it's the first thing you are taught, it's serve, suffer, sacrifice  for the organisation and also Chairperson, what I wanted to highlight was the aims and objectives of the PAC.  Of course, Chairperson, they are five in all, aims and objectives of the PAC which you are taught when you join the organisation.  Of course the first one everybody knows, to unite and rally the Africans under the ...(indistinct) of African Nationalism, there are five of them, Chairperson, so I wanted to highlight that.\n\tAnd thirdly Chairperson, I wanted to highlight the question of the operations.  The Committee knows that there's a difference between repossession unit and the offensive side, they were totally different and of course it was known that it was code name Beauty Salon, the repossessing units and their modus operandi definitely were totally different Chairperson, as compared to the other side, which was an offensive side.  Specifically their's was to repossess and of course, Chairperson it was for specific targets and of course Chairperson, I know that not all of the farmers' farms were targeted for repossession.  It was let by Tabelo Paseko.\n\tSo the offensive unit, of course their's was to go and attack, they would never take anything - leave everything as it is.  Of course there were instances where they would say, as a soldier if you see a gun, you cannot leave it lying there, you will take it, which is understandable, as long as you've not put the other members in problem, or killed in the process when you are doing that.\n\tWe had a similar instance here in Bloemfontein regarding Wesselsbron attack, where members of APLA the offensive unit, went to attack and repossess and the Committee wanted an explanation in as much as they asserted that they did not dispute that they were APLA members, but they wanted to know why an offensive unit went to go and repossess and Letlapa Mphahlele has come and made an affidavit as to why that repossession unit, a specialised unit was not available at that time and the operation had to be taken and as a result they made a mess of that operation, they left the money which they wanted there, the only thing they did was to attack.  They only took cheques which were useless at the end of the day.  \n\tSo what I'm trying to say Chairperson, is that there was indeed separation.",
