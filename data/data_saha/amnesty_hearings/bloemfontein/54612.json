If I may perhaps to enlighten the Committee.  On the occasion of March, this year, when we were given notice for the first time or rather when our clients were given notice for the first time, at that stage Mr Mkosinati Nkhohla was also an applicant, and if you have been favoured with copies of the documentation which was then circulated, Mr Chairman, you will have seen a document with a cover page which looks like this.  It said\n\"Amnesty application of Kulekane Lawrence Mbatha, Walter Smiles and Darlington Mkosinati Nkhohla.\"\nWe are now informed, Mr Chairman, that Mr Mbawa, the other person who was also convicted in the criminal trial, has also filed an application for amnesty. We wish to mention here, because we consider it to be important, that we have not seen, nor have we been provided with a copy of his application and therefore we cannot at this stage speculate as to whether his evidence may or may not take the matter of the present applicants any further.

And, Mr Chairman, the point I am getting at, is simply this.  If you read those last 90 odd pages, Mr Chairman, it is quite clear that what appears from that, are material disputes arising among these witnesses, and disputes arising in the evidence of the witnesses where they contradict themselves as well.\n\tThat being so, there are two points which we believe we should inform the Committee of.

The critical factor here, Mr Chairman, is that two other people than the applicants were convicted of the incident for which the applicants today apply for amnesty.  They were convicted on the strength of the evidence of Mr Themba Nkosi Ngquele.  He has not been notified, Mr Chairman, and we submit, with respect, that he is clearly a person implicated, and it has to be so, because unless you can find at the end of the evidence, that the two present applicants perpetrated the offence, they cannot receive amnesty. That is clear on the requirements of the Act.  In order to do that, Mr Chairman, it follows by necessity, that his Lordship Mr Justice Munnik must have been incorrect in his finding and that could only have been based on the evidence of Themba Nkosi Ngquele.  \tTherefore, we say, Mr Chairman, that you cannot sensibly hear this application unless Ngquele is here to come and tell you whatever he wants to tell you.  He may either tell you that he lied to the Judge or that he spoke the truth, but whatever he has to tell the Committee, you will have to hear him, in order to be able to decide the truthfulness or otherwise, and particularly whether there has been a full disclosure by the present two applicants.  That is all we want to say, Mr Chairman.\n\tWe are ready. May we place on record we are ready to continue, we are prepared as far as cross-examination is concerned, so we are not asking for a postponement on our behalf.  We want to make that perfectly clear, but we also believe that you should be aware of these background facts before we start, Mr Chairman, so that you can make the proper ruling in this regard.

Should this Committee find that the two present applicants were in fact the people who perpetrated the offence, by necessary implication, they are implicated in defeating the ends of justice, because Mr Chairman, there is a piece of evidence which you will hear about, and that is this; after the trial commenced, the defence attorney and counsel, who was Mr Denzil Potgieter, approached the State advocates, who appeared for the Attorney-General with a witness and that witness, by coincidence, is Mr Smiles, who is an applicant before you here.  Together with an affidavit that had been made and signed by Mr Smiles, in which he assumed the guilt for throwing the hand-grenade.  The State chose not to follow the suggestion by Mr Denzil Potgieter to release the two accused and to charge Mr Smiles.  As a result of that, Mr Chairman, Smiles was told to go away by the Attorney-General and the case proceeded.  During the trial Mbaqa gave no evidence in his defence, and in fact, no defence was put to any witness, apparently.  Nkhohla had an alibi, Mr Chairman, and that alibi was rejected.\n\tThe important thing here is this; during the investigation by my clients of the case, Nkhohla made a pointing out and a confession.  The confession was cryptically \"this is where I stood when I threw the hand-grenade\".  We say this, Mr Chairman, unless Nkhohla is here to give that evidence you cannot decide on the truthfulness of any of their evidence.

            "Mr Adriano Cassandro was a member of the United Nations observing mission to South Africa, who observed the adherence inter alia to the National Peace Accord by all political parties in South Africa, who subscribed to that accord.  He was also acting in terms of a Security Council resolution and agreements between South African political parties and the United Nations.\n\tAt the time of the incident he was based in Kimberley.  He was working in close co-operation with the members of the Regional and Local Peace Committee, and with the Regional co-ordinator of the Peace Secretariat for the Northern Cape, Adv Jean Nel.\n\tMr Cassandro was also present at the march.  He was seriously injured. His injuries were to such an extent that there was a very big chance that he would lose his foot.  Luckily the doctors succeeded in saving the limb.  Unfortunately he has retained a limp, which he will retain for the rest of his life.  He is one of the victims who was extremely seriously injured. You would notice amongst the 40 to 50 victims there are slighter injuries, but his surely rank as the most serious injuries sustained.\n\tThe fact that Mr Cassandro was a victim was brought to the notice of the Amnesty Committee during the first rounds of hearings in these applications held in March in Bloemfontein.  Mr Cassandro, unfortunately, was not informed of the proceedings this morning by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.\n\tApart from the fact that as a victim, Mr Cassandro has a clear right to be present at the hearing and to give evidence. Mr Cassandro is also a crucial witness to the process. He participated in his capacity as a representative of the United Nations and as a representative of all the parties to the National Peace Accord, but in his capacity as an independent international observer, in all the negotiations in the run-up to the march; all the negotiations, all the guarantees furnished. He participated in the march itself, to monitor compliance with all the guarantees furnished. He was seriously injured, but apart from that, in hospital he also monitored the aftermath of the breach of the National Peace Accord.\n\tMr Cassandro himself investigated the matter in order to furnish a comprehensive report to the United Nations.  Therefore I maintain that he is also a crucial witness to this process.  \n\tThe hand-grenade attack did not take place in isolation. The hand-grenade attack took place within the framework of negotiations and agreements reached on the basis of the National Peace Accord.  Apart from that, it would appear as if the attack was also in part an attack on the Peace Committee operating in terms of the National Peace Accord.  \n\tI maintain, with respect, Mr Chairman, that Mr Cassandro as a victim has therefore a clear right to be informed of the procedure and as a witness should participate in the proceedings. I can perhaps, also mention, furthermore, Mr Cassandro is at the moment stationed in Angola as a United Nations observer to Angola.  He travels apparently regularly to South Africa to the headquarters of the United Nations or to a representative of the regional headquarters stationed in Pretoria, of the United Nations Observer Mission to Angola.\n\tDuring the course of last week he was on a brief visit to Pretoria for urgent medical care.  We were able to meet very informally and to speak very briefly on the matter.  Mr Cassandro instructed me to inform you this morning that he would in all earnest want to participate and exercise his rights as a victim, that he was prevented to do so because he has not received communication of the proceedings, and that I was given instructions by him to appear on his behalf only in this matter, and that is to request the Committee to postpone the matter to a further date of which he can be given full notice, and in order to allow enough time for the TRC to furnish him with full documentation, in order to enable him to exercise his rights as a victim and to participate in these proceedings as a crucial witness.",

So Mr Cassandro has not had access to the full documentation in front of this Committee at the moment.

On the basis of the documentation given, it is clear that he would want to reflect on his attitude towards the applications. I do not have instructions at this stage to oppose the application on his behalf.  My instructions are to approach the Committee, to put the matter to the Committee that as a victim he has not been notified of this procedure, that he has a crucial interest in the matter and that he has crucial information to furnish to this Committee. I am sure that after notification and after full documentation has been furnished to Mr Cassandro, he will be able to come to a final decision as to his attitude to the applications. His initial attitude reflected to me that he would consider opposing the applications.\n\tI might perhaps, also add, that while we are addressing the matter of Mr Cassandro, on the basis of the information which he gave, it is also clear that the evidence which he can submit to this Committee, will also be crucial to the opposition to the application by my other client, Jean Nel.  To the extent that at the moment we do not have access to Mr Cassandro's evidence, because he was not notified of the procedure, it therefore also impinges upon the right or touches on the right of my other client, Jean Nel.",

Mr Chairman, I just want to respond to what my learned friend has just said in the following way.\n\tFirstly, it is true that the name of the victim Cassandro was brought to the notice or to the attention of the Truth Commission.  Number two, it is true that he has not been informed.  But the reasons therefore are as follows; that the investigative unit tried to trace Mr Cassandro and when they came back to me they said when Mr Cassandro was in Kimberley when this incident took place, the only address they had, is that he was staying in an hotel and they \ncannot trace him any further.  That closed the matter.  \n\tMr Chairman, this past week on the 22nd of this month, Cape Town office called me and gave a message that a Mr Cassandro has left a message for me and a telephone number to call him. I did call him on the telephone and the telephone was for Pretoria.  I called and I spoke to a lady who said she was the secretary at the Embassy in Pretoria, by the name of Tina, and Tina said to me that Mr Cassandro, yes, was around Pretoria, but he is no more based in Pretoria, he is now working at head office in Angola, and he has since left for Angola.  I asked her and when do you expect him back, and she said well, he said to me around by the 1st or the 2nd of September.  That closes the matter, Mr Chairman.  \n\tThe reason why we could not serve on him, he was in Angola all the time.  In as far as the clear right is concerned, I cannot gainsay that. It is for the Committee to decide what is meant by clear right.  But I have a promise, Mr chairman, in as far as the crucialness of his evidence is concerned.  My learned friend stated that his evidence is a crucial one which is important to this Committee. Of course, I had a discussion with him yesterday during our meeting about this witness, and he indicated to me that this witness is very important because he will sketch to us the events before the incident as well as after the incident. But what is he going to sketch to this Committee about, I do not know.  But from what my learned friend has just said, is in as far as the position was before the incident and the monitoring after the incident, if that is the crucialness of this witness' evidence, as it has been put, then I will not hesitate to state that nothing is in dispute in as far a the position then in Kimberley or in Bloemfontein was before the incident.  Nothing is again in dispute in as far as the position in Kimberley or in Bloemfontein was after the incident.  But if my learned friend was saying he is going to tell us, Mr Cassandro is going to tell us about Walter Smiles, he is going to tell us about the two applicants, as to how they did this and why they did this, then I would change my attitude and say indeed, he is a crucial witness. But if he is going to just paint the political climate then, this is not in dispute. We know it was unstable then before the incident and even after the incident, but I will leave this to the Committee.",

It is unfortunate that such inconvenience may have to be caused to them.  However, the reasons which we have been influenced - the factors which have influenced us, leaves us with no alternative.

The second one is a request to this Committee to ask the investigative unit of the TRC to do a full investigation of the breaches of the National Peace Accord, as posed by this particular attack.\n\tI mentioned earlier that there is no indication and no information put in front of this Committee of the broader issues surrounding this particular march and the attack, and I believe that that has a very important bearing on the decisions to be taken by the Committee, and that the appropriate body to do an objective and full investigation of the matter in order to furnish you with a report, would be the investigate unit. \n\tA third matter arises from my discussion with Mr Cassandro.  It was pointed out during that discussion that Mr Cassandro believes that the United Nations would appreciate notification of these proceedings, because it is apparently customary for them to send a representative or to participate in the proceedings.  Apart from such an invitation, Mr Cassandro also drew our attention to the fact that a full and complete investigation of the incident, as conducted by him, was furnished in a report to the United Nations and I believe that that report would also be of great assistance to the Committee and the information in that report in order to enable this Committee to reach the correct decision.\n\tAnd lastly, if you would indulge me, Mr Chairperson, this is the second time that this particular hearing has been set for Bloemfontein.  We believe that this particular incident touched the very heart and fabric of the society in Kimberley.  We would in all earnest request you and Adv Mpshe's office, to consider seriously holding the next round of hearings in Kimberley. We also would like to request you, because this is linked with this matter, to ensure that everything is reasonably done to ensure that all the victims with an interest in this affair, can participate freely in the proceedings should they choose to do so.
