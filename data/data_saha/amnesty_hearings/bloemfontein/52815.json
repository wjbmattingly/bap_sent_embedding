The question whether he can be convicted or not, does not arise before this Committee, but there's sufficient basis in law, prima facie, from that evidence, to infer that he admitted to murder, because simply on the question, amongst others, of dolus eventualis, he foresaw the possibility of these people being killed, and he planned accordingly.

            "Mr Chair, I'm not saying every time, I'm saying in these circumstances, in accordance with this plan, I'm saying from that evidence it can be inferred that the applicant was reckless, having foreseen the possibility of resistance from the deceased, but he took no steps to ensure that that eventuality does not arise, and he reconciled himself with that eventuality by planning in such a manner that they would then kill if that case arose, and this is what happened.\n\tOr alternatively, he could be charged on culpable homicide, and if he is so charged, then he's entitled to amnesty if his case is good.  \n\tI'm saying it could be inferred from his evidence that he admitted to culpable homicide, for example, which is a competent verdict to murder, and if he's granted amnesty on murder charge for example, he cannot be charged subsequently on the charge of culpable homicide on the similar facts.  Therefore, if he's granted amnesty on the murder charges, he's as well exempted from being charged for culpable homicide, and the basis for saying that he could be charged for culpable homicide is clearly that a reasonable man, in the position of the applicant, ought to have taken necessary steps that would have been indicative that the gunfire only came from the car under the circumstances, and that only in that eventuality would they have opened fire on the occupants of the car, and the applicant did not, and secondly, a reasonable man in his position, having foreseen the possibility of fire triggered by some other source, other than by the occupants of the car, ought to have taken such steps to prevent the killing of occupants in that case, and applicant did not and was therefore negligent, it can be argued, and he admitted in his evidence, and it is trite that if a trap is flawed, as it seems to have been the case here, in law such a trap would be rejected.\n\tIssues to be decided, Mr Chair, here are whether the applicant committed the offences as described him, and those offences whether they were associated with a political objective, and secondly whether he made a full disclosure.\n\tNow I proceed to address that.  The following facts are common cause:  that the applicant was a member of SAP at the time, that is on the 7th April 1992, and was a captain in the Detective Branch, Sasolburg.  \n\tSecondly, that his immediate superior was Swanepoel, and that the applicant planned the arrest which resulted in subsequent killings of the deceaseds.\n\tIt is also common cause that the applicant ordered Fouche, his colleague, to infiltrate the deceaseds' group organisation or gang, with a view to trap them and arrest them on behalf of the State, of which he was an employee.\n\tIt's also common cause that on that day the deceased persons proceeded to Vaal Park Sentra Hypersave in a stolen yellow Cressida.  They were armed, albeit with small arms, and were shot and killed by the applicant and his colleagues.\n\tOn the question of political objective, it is disputed by the leader of the investigation, on behalf of the families, that the deceased were members of a political organisation, and the Committee has to make a finding in this respect, and the applicant has stated that according to the information that he received, and his belief, based on that information, the deceased persons were members of a political organisation, namely ANC and MK.\n\tSecondly, on the issue of political objective, the Committee must make a finding on whether, if it accepts that the deceased were members of a political organisation, whether the applicant had reason to believe that the deceaseds' conduct was associated with a political activity.\n\tThirdly, the Committee must also make a finding on this aspect as to whether the applicant's actions, which resulted in the commission of the killings, were associated with a political objective.\n\tNow, on the question whether the deceased were members of a political organisation, the applicant, in his evidence, stated that he relied on information from three sources, namely Chris Fouche, Elsa de Lange and Joseph, one of the deceased persons.  These people supplied him with information either collectively or at different instances or occasions.  \n\tThe applicant's evidence has not been challenged by way of evidence, testimony before the Committee, except for some untested evidence by way of statements in the bundle, and that evidence remains untested by cross-examination.  \n\tTherefore, on that basis, the Committee is obliged to accept applicant's version.",

Fouche is said to have told the applicant that the deceased talked about their political feelings, expressed their preference for an ANC government.  Elsa confirmed the fact that the gang, or the organisation or unit, would attend rallies, political rallies, and were involved in fighting with IFP.  \n\tElsa corroborated the applicant in this aspect in all material respects, namely that the deceased were MK ANC activities and underwent training, but she said, which appeared to be a discrepancy, which I submit it was not, her understanding of political activities were involvement in political violence, so to speak, bombings, murder and so on, and she was firm that her group did not involve in those, but then explained what they were involved in, but obviously the Committee knows that from what she admitted and denied it's one and the same thing, all these activities were political activities.

You can't reject it because there are lies in evidence and reject it in total, and the evidence of the applicant has not been contradicted in evidence.  We have bare denials from the family by way of questions by the leader of evidence, but the family members are here, they are here, they did not give evidence to refute what the applicant has said, and we don't have evidence as to whether the deceased person lived with their families and the duration thereof if they lived together, whether their families were aware of the deceaseds' movements, we don't have evidence to that.  What we have is that it is denied, but I'm saying that is a bad denial, in the face of the applicant's insistence that the information he received was that they were members of a political organisation.\n\tNow, on the question whether the shooting was connected with a political objective on the 7th of April 1992, now I submit that an important question to ask there on this aspect is whether the applicant was malicious in this plan, was he genuinely conducting his duties, or did he have an ulterior motive, was he malicious, I submit that is the question to be asked.\n\tNow, I submit that he was not, he was doing his duties, an implied duty.  At that time all members of the police, whether detective or security, the dichotomy between various duties of the police did not exist inasfar as political matters were concerned, it was not maintained by the State, it was there on paper, but any member of the police, it's a notorious fact that they would do their duties inasfar as political matters are concerned, irrespective of a unit.  It would be artificial to argue that this man was involved in a crime investigation and that had nothing to do with security matters, that should have been handled by security matters.  That did not exist.  Even municipal police, traffic officers, were involved in arresting political activists, even members of the public, if they were so inclined.\n\tNow, my submission is that the applicant, it was within his duty to plan and arrest, and if necessary kill the deceased.  That is borne out by the statement made by General Malan in the bundle, even if that statement did not exist, this is a notorious fact, it's known by anybody in South Africa at the time, that activists had to be eliminated, because otherwise they would eliminate the State.

I submit that applicant made full disclosure as to what he believed and what he was told.  He was honest and straightforward.  There is no evidence before the Committee that there are matters that he left out or deliberately omitted which are material to his application.\n\tI submit lastly that in terms of the Act, section 20A and B, the requirements thereof, that the offences were political and were associated with the conflict of the past.  I submit that his version, if it's accepted that these people were indeed members of ANC and MK, which was in conflict with the government of the past, and that he then made full disclosure, and in terms of section 22B, he satisfied that requirement, namely that the offences were ordered by an employee of the State, here I refer to the letter by General Malan, but I'm saying even if that letter didn't exist, there was an implied authority on the employees of the State at the time to deal with political activists, either by arrest and/or killing.\n\tI submit further that,in terms of section 23 ...(intervention).",

The argument that you're putting before us and the evidence is that the killing was never planned, it only eventuated when things went wrong.  Now that is not a political motive, that's part of police duties then, to act in a certain way.  How do you bring political motive, because it's not, the political in terms of 22B is not in the broad political conflict, especially when it concerns a functionary of the State, it must be under an order or a direct order.  You rely on an implied order, which I think the Amnesty Committee has taken as a line, but the implied order does not relate to duties, it relates to criminal activities, outside of the scope of duty.  Sorry, Mr Madasa, that's perhaps again the argument that I asked you earlier to think through, put it in clear terms before us, because I remain with a difficulty with that at the moment.",
