            "As I explained to that on the 24th of July 1993 it was on a Saturday we left Botshabelo.  We went to the place called Van Staden's Rest, in a farm called Wesselsdal.  When we left Botshabelo we knew very well what was going to happen.  We knew exactly how many people were staying on that farm, how many houses are there in that farm and the distance between those houses.  We left having a full picture of the farm the way we were informed by the chief commander who went before to do reconnaissance.\n\tIt is true we left with a taxi and we alighted at the crossroads of Van Staden's Rest.  We had intention why we had to alight at that particular place at night.  We walked on foot up to the place.  We left at night Mr Chairperson.  When we arrived there we came nearer the house.  We were able to see that there are an extra two cars.  We were told that there were only two cars, in other words there were four cars at that farm. The idea was to kill, but because we found that the situation has changed the unit commander called off the operation because he was surprised that there are other extra two cars present at the farm and then we left.  \n\tWe went to a different place where we sat down then we discussed what should be done.  What I would explain that it was in the morning at dawn or when the sun rose, as I was second in command the unit commander informed me that we should go to that place and try to find out or enquire what is happening.  When I say there, I mean at Mr Smith's place, or Mr Smith's farm.\n\tWhat I can explain to the Commission is we knew where we were going because we were going to Mr Oliphant's sister who is Sophie Oliphant.  For us to go there was to gather information about the people who came there.  It might be people from other farms.\n\tWe went there.  We met Sophie Oliphant. We looked for the information in such a way that it could not raise suspicions about those people who were there. She informed us that it is the son and the daughter of Mr and Mrs Smith.  \n\tAnd then again we found another information that the people in that area they would leave and go to church.  We found that valuable information which would inform the unit commander and other comrades about the true picture of the situation in that area.  Therefore if that is the information we gathered we were able to determine the time to attack. \n\tWe returned then we gave them the whole information.  Whilst we were there we saw one car leaving, a red car.  After that one a white bakkie left.  Inside that bakkie was a certain White child behind the bakkie.  I called them Boers, maybe you will be happy if I say White people.\n\tAfter they left then we went to the house.  Those who went to the house were four.  It was myself, it was Mr Mtjikelo, the unit commander, he was supposed to be there so that he should give instructions of what to be done and what not to be done, and Mr Mabitsa, Mr Wa-Nthoba and Mr Mabitsa.  It seems we made mistakes that I said it is myself, Mr Mtjikelo and Xhiba, I have added another names, that is to say Mabitsa and Nthoba, we left them at the storeroom.",

I don't as what's the difference a shed and the storeroom.  We left them there.\n\tWhen we arrived there I knocked at the door together with my comrades and a White lady came, that is the wife to Mr Smith.  We asked her where was her husband, we are there to request petrol.  She told us that we should wait for a while, she will go and call her husband.  We waited there and then she went back inside the house.\n\tWhat I would explain is that whilst we were still waiting there we didn't wait for a long time Mr Smith appeared and when he arrived I informed him that we are asking or requesting petrol, the car we are using is stuck there.  He took us to the garage.  He just said to us, follow me. When we arrived at the garage he sent Mr Xhiba to the storeroom, to the shed.  When he came back, when Mr Xhiba came back he sent him to collect - I don't know as to whether it's a hosepipe or a container but he sent him there, when he returned he gave him what he was sent to collect.",

That sign was to say I should attack.  I didn't waste time.  I took my weapon which was on my waist, then I raised my hand, then I stabbed him at the back.  What I may tell you is that, yes, I stabbed him, I stabbed him once.

            "What I would like to explain or to add Sir, I will appeal to the members of the Commission to understand the prevailing circumstances during those years in our country.  I will request them to use their own discretion if these people who were called Blacks were oppressed during those times what was their expectations concerning those people if those people had bad feelings I will explain to the Commission that it was okay about what has happened.  But if they were supposed to be positive according to the situations because they were so under oppression, but if they were supposed to feel wrongly - I will request the Committee because use their own discretion.\n\tAnother thing I would like to say concerning this amnesty if I am being pressed on my toes by somebody who regards himself as White I don't want to consider that as a mistake and told him that I could realise that your feet is on top of mine, no that is not a mistake at all.  What I am trying to explain here is that this person has pressed me on my toes so I need to explain to him will you please remove your foot from my toes.  I will quote in English Sir if you allow me:\n\"Where there is suppression and oppression there will always be resistance.  Where there is an action there is a reaction.  And where there is reaction there is resistance\".\nBut not in this case which are appealing in our country and those people who claim as bosses they do whatever they want to do with us.  \n\tLadies and gentlemen apartheid is a sin and it's wrong in such a way that we cannot compare it with anything in the world.  If it wasn't wrong it was not supposed to be approved.  It was supposed to be here today.  What I am trying because explain our history told us that in 1973 the United Nations made a special committee against apartheid isolating the apartheid which was prevailing in South Africa in 1973.  The history told us that there was a United Nations International Convention on the suppression and the punishment of apartheid, it was called crime against humanity, that is crime.  That is why they have scrapped apartheid.  They appealed to us that we must forgive them about what they have done.  This has happened for so many years, I am not talking about 18 or three years time in this case.  \n\tWhat I would like to explain because you is that we are the ones who have felt the pains and we know it exactly.  For example, gentlemen, we have been staying in Because and you know the houses, even the toilets just go to Because, even here in Manaung where Black people are being situated, you will see hunger, those people are very hungry, just enter here around us in this area, there is prosperity Sir, there is life in those areas.  It means that - there are so many bicycles, tricycles and the motor cars but in the area where I am staying I can't see a single bicycle, I can say it's very rarely.  The only thing that you can see on our streets is that a wheelbarrow.  Maybe it's the issue of our colour being black we are always carrying these five litres of paint just to paint our own people.\n\tHonourable members we were not being oppressed by mistake, this was a real purpose.  Mr Verwoerd is the architect of apartheid.  This has been planned, it's not a mistake to our Black people in this country.  This was intentional.  If you have to react they say you are wrong.  According to the laws which represented them perhaps the issue is that we were Blacks.  Even in front of court that is wrong.  I can't remember where in the Bible, I can't even remember comrades, that God have explained that people, especially the Black people should be oppressed.  All this has been done intentionally, we are the victims of apartheid. ...(intervention)",
