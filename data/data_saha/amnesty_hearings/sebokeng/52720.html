<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Mthembu, may I remind you that you're still under oath.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">VICTOR MTHANDENI MTHEMBU:</span> (s.u.o.)</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, Mr Berger, you may proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR BERGER:</span> (Continues)   Thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a>	Mr Mthembu, is it correct that you came to the Vaal in 1988?</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And that you went to live in the Kwamasiza Hostel, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You left Kwamasiza and you landed up at Kwamadala, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Is it correct that that was because the residents of Kwamasiza were predominantly Xhosa speaking  and they didn't want you there because you were Zulu speaking, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And that was the reason for Kwamadala being occupied in the first place by Zulu speaking residents?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And in fact the vast majority of the residents from Kwamadala were ex-residents of Kwamasiza who had been chased out of Kwamasiza by the Xhosa speaking residents?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And Kwamasiza is in Sebokeng, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Now, is it also correct that you had two very close friends at Kwamadala?  You've already told the Committee about Mr Themba Mabote but you were also very friendly with Mr Sipho Lukhozi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you share the same room at Kwamadala?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No, we did not share a room.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What room were you in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I used 300, Room 3008.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And Themba Mabote?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> He used another room but I do not remember the number thereof.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And Mr Sipho Lukhozi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> He too had his own room.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I'm asking for the number of his room.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I cannot remember what room number he was in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The night of the attack, can you tell the Committee whether Sipho Lukhozi was present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, he was present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Where did you see him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I saw him as we were going through the main gate to go and attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Could you give the Committee the names of all the people that you saw that night at one point or another who were part of the attacking group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> There were many people there and therefore it is not possible to give the names of each one of them.  There were many of them and we did not know one another.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Can you give the names of the ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can you just give us the names of those persons that you can still recall, if you don't recall say so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I am trying to say here that I do not remember the names.  I am sure about Sipho Lukhozi who was present that evening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You cannot remember a single other name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No, I do not remember others because I too went there because I was angry knowing that we were going to attack and I therefore did not have time to record down people's names.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And in the six years since the attack you haven't been able to recall a single other name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> As you have just explained that it is after six years, you too can see that it is difficult, it is after a long time now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Through you Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a>	Mr Mthembu, you can't even remember whether your fellow co-applicants were one of the people who were in the group during the night of the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Some were present but some were not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Who of them in your group do you still remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> As I have explained Sir, I do not remember, it is very difficult for me.  I've just indicated that I do not remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What about your co-accused at the trial?  You can't remember whether anyone of them was present at the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> As I have explained that I had, I was with Khanyile and Msane, those are the two names that I can still recall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well according to you yesterday, you could recall Buthelezi's name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Just one second Mr Berger.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a>	Sorry Mr Mthembu, just so that we can be clear here.  The question wasn't who was with you on that night, the question was who do you remember seeing on that night, okay?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Now I do understand.  I am trying to explain that I do not remember.  The gentleman should understand that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Isn't it just that you don't want to tell, you do remember but you don't want to tell?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I wouldn't say I don't want to talk about something that I have to say here before this Committee.  I am just saying that I do not remember.  I think you understand that it's been a long time since this thing happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Sipho Lukhozi has made an affidavit in which he says that he was not present during the attack.  I will read it to you, it's paragraph 2 of his affidavit</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a>"In this moment or at this moment I don't like to go and sit in front of the TRC hearing because I was sentenced for this case of Boipatong Massacre when I was not present.  I was not even around the area of Boipatong"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a>Is that false according to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> As far as I know Sipho was present.  It may as well be that he is saying this because he was sentenced.  If he was not present, why then was he sentenced?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You just testified that you saw him at the gate as you were leaving the hostel, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you see him in Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No, I do not recall seeing him at Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What was he doing at the gate when you saw him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> He was standing there as one of those people who were going to accompany us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> He was armed and part of the attacking group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, I'd just like to point out that if one has a look at the amnesty application of Mr Themba Lukhozi, I beg your pardon, Mr Sipho Lukhozi, he says there at page 145</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a>"The night of the 17th of June 1992 we went to the Boipatong residential armed with kierries, assegais, spears, firearms and other weapons"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a>...[no Afrikaans translation - transcriber's own translation] </p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a>And he sets out that in fact he was there and that he was part of the attack but ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Does it say in his affidavit that he has just filed, doesn't he mention something about being forced of some kind to make the application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> No, he ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a>CHAIRPERSON</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a>"furthermore I didn't make any application for amnesty.  Advocate Strydom and other one came to me about myself to make application"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a>he refused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Indeed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So if that is the case, what value does one place either on that statement that you've just read or on the affidavit itself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I just wanted to point out to the Committee that there seems to be something funny going on, and the reason I say that Chairperson, is because if you look at the bottom of page 146 and you see there who signed as the deponent and you compare that signature with the signature of Thomas Lukhozi on the affidavit, it's a completely different signature.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Precisely the point, that's the point I'm trying to make to you and that is, in this affidavit the man says: "I was approached to make an application for amnesty but I refused".  If one accepts that then it's simple ...[indistinct] to question the application that occurs at 144.  In fact it is our - in view of this affidavit by Mr Lukhozi, we propose I think to do no more than just to strike this application off the role with the direction that perhaps the TRC should go back to Mr Lukhozi and advise him of his rights concerning an application for amnesty and the consequences of the withdrawal of this application in view of the fact that it may well be after the cut-off date.  That is what we propose doing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a>	We are not disposed at this stage simply to withdraw his application on the basis, we believe that his rights ought to be explained to him before any further steps can be taken.  Suffice it to say that in view of this affidavit, the signatures that appear on this document and the one there, there may well be something in what he says in this affidavit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> About not making an application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, but that is not what we have to decide.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Indeed Chairperson, but the point I'm making is that this application of Mr Lukhozi starting at page 144, was submitted as part of a group of applications and I'm suggesting that there is something funny with this application and this application wasn't submitted on its own, it was submitted as a group and there might be something in that.  I won't take it any further at this stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, may I come in at this stage?  Firstly I want to make the point that I can't see what this issue has to do with the cross-examination of the witness on the witness stand at this moment.  	Secondly I want to place it on record that I went to Medium B Prison, Diepkloof and I obtained this statement which appears on page 144 to 146 from Mr Lukhozi and interpreter accompanied me, he signed that statement in my presence, that is his signature and if needs be I will call the interpreter and lead evidence on this aspect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a>	I furthermore state that his second affidavit, the one that was handed in yesterday does not reflect the true situation and I will give evidence to that effect if needs be.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Berger?</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Mthembu, the reason that I'm asking you about this is because in one application Mr Lukhozi says he was part of the attack, in another statement he says he wasn't part of the attack and I'm asking you whether he was and you say: "Yes, he was part of the attack", is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I want to now refer you, well tell you about a document and ask you for your response.  This is a memorandum ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Berger, just before you proceed, to the extent that the affidavit by Mr Lukhozi has now been referred to, perhaps it is appropriate to enter it on the record and this would be the first of those, wouldn't it?   Shall we make it Exhibit A, I think it is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Very well, the handwritten statement which is undated, made by Thomas Sipho Lukhozi, which at the second page indicates that it was taken by one, S M Madiba, will be handed in as Exhibit A and in view of the contents of that statement it appears appropriate at this stage to have the application by Thomas Lukhozi, which is AM7396/97 being struck off the role.  We would recommend that the TRC should endeavour to get in touch with Mr Lukhozi and indicate the implications of the withdrawal of his application if that is what he intends to do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a>	It appears from his statement that he has given to, he has given a name of an Advocate A S Burger and his cellular phone number, perhaps the TRC could also get in touch with the lawyer reflected in that statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a>	Mr Strydom, is there anything you want to add to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> I've got nothing to add.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You do confirm that you're not acting for him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> I'm not acting for him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, indeed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Maybe I can just place on record what happened here.  After he signed that first statement, the application, there was a request for further particulars and a request to submit an affidavit.  He was again visited in jail and at that stage he did not want to speak to us any further and he said his advocate is Advocate Burger and that's the reason why at the beginning of this hearing we withdraw as his representatives.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is there anything you wanted to place on record in this regard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, the application has been struck off the role but I take it that the documents themselves are still capable of being referred to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, for whatever relevance ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> For whatever they're worth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, just also for record purposes, I'm not the Advocate Berger that is referred to in that statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We accept that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Mthembu, ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Sorry to interrupt again, sorry.  There was reference to the signature that differs in his statement.  I've got another statement which the same Thomas Lukhozi has signed and this statement was to withdraw his bail because he was serving a sentence in any event on another charge and if there's going to be a reference to his signature, I would like to hand up this document just to show the signature on this document as well.  I would beg leave to hand up this document.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do we have enough copies of this document?</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Unfortunately I haven't got copies at this stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That's okay.  ...[indistinct] on record, this signature which appears here differs from the one that is on the handwritten statement and it also differs from the one - well does it, I'm no handwriting expert but it does seem to me that it's similar to the one that is on page 146 of the application paper.  Would you like to have a look at this Mr Brink?  Would you also show it to Mr Berger?</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Mr Chairman, likewise I don't pretend to be a handwriting expert but the signatures on this document and that which appears at page 146 appears to be the same.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Will you show that to Mr Berger?</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I'm also no handwriting expert but it could be, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Very well, the sworn statement by Thomas Mkeshleni Lukhozi deposed to on the 5th of February 1998 will be handed in as Exhibit B.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a>	Yes, very well.  Thank you Mr Berger, will you proceed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Thank you Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a>	Mr Mthembu, I want to read to you from a document which was compiled by the police and I want to ask you to comment if you can on the allegations made in this document.  It says:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a>"On the 15th of March 1992, an attack took place at Chiefs Place Tavern in Sharpeville.  Two woman were killed and several injured"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a>Do you know anything about that attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No, Sir, I know nothing about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> One of the perpetrators of the attack was injured by one of his colleagues by accident.  He has stated on affidavit as follows.  Now, this is his affidavit</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a>"I am able to live a the Kwamadala Hostel without charge.  I am unemployed, as are several of the other residents of the hostel.  We are supported by those residents who are employed"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a>I assume you can confirm that as applying to the people who came from Umsinga, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, that is correct Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> He goes on to say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a>"In addition we received food parcels from the International Red Cross every two weeks"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, I have knowledge about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a>MR BERGER</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a>"We also robbed people in town.  We as a group approached individuals and threatened them so that they gave us money"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No comment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Does that mean you have no knowledge or you don't want to comment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Berger, does that relate to the Boipatong Massacre?</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Indeed it does.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, please let's get to the point at some point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, if I could just tell you that this document came out of the docket.  It has a covering sheet, the subject is</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a>"Moord: Boipatong 92.06.17"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a>And it says and I'm translating:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a>"Attached is a statement from a nameless person which has been obtained in a very sensitive way"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a>Second paragraph:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a>"The content of the statement was for me however of great value in the investigation.</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a>		Please hand this over to Lieutenant Colonel Eager and explain the situation to him"</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a>And then it speaks about one of the people mentioned in the statement.  Now this statement is particularly relevant to the Boipatong attack, I would submit.  I've tried to get to the point as quickly as possible by, instead of asking a whole lot of questions, to say to the witness: "Can you confirm this", and to take him through the statement.  I can't think of a quicker way of doing it, thank you.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a>	I will try and summarise large chunks and then you can tell me whether you agree or don't agree Mr Mthembu.  I will leave out the non-important parts.  He says:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a>"All the residents of the Kwamadala Hostel are members of the Inkatha Freedom Party.  Amongst the residents there are individuals whom are leaders of the Inkatha Freedom Party"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a>Correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a>MR BERGER</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a>"Amongst them is one, Buthelezi"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a>One of the leaders, yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> He then says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a>"A system exists at the Kwamadala Hostel whereby each resident becomes part of a unit"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a>Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a>MR BERGER</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a>"I was placed in a unit consisting of four members"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a>Mr Mthembu, how many members were in your unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> There were three.</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And who were the people in your unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Mr Thembelani Buthelezi, myself and Ntwzee, the secretary.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Do you know people in any of the other units?</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> There were some although I cannot specify their names but there were people in other units.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And what were these units called, what was the name given to these units?</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> They were the Indunas in the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Were you an Induna?</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I don't understand, but let me continue.  He says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a>"I was trained in the use of weapons by Buthelezi"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I don't know anything about that, I don't even know who you are talking about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well he goes on to say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a>"Every resident is trained in the use of weapons"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I don't have knowledge of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well you were trained in the use of weapons were you not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> How was it possible for you to successfully apply for three firearms if you had no training in weapons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I think that is a mistake, there were two guns not three.  I went to the Vereeniging shooting range and that's where I practised shooting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, I don't have copies available for the Committee at this stage but I have a document which is also taken from the docket, which is an extract from Mr Mthembu's identity document and in there there is space for firearm licences.  There are three firearm licences reflected there.  I will make copies of that document and hand it in to the Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a>	Two of those guns I can tell you Mr Mthembu, were applied for and granted at the beginning of 1992 and the third gun was applied for and granted at the beginning of June 1992.</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Sir, I admit that I applied for licences for my guns but what I do not agree with is the amount, the number of guns.  I explained even yesterday that I have only two guns.</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you or did you not successfully apply for a licence at the beginning of June 1992?</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Let's assume this man had 20 firearms, how is that relevant to the question of whether or not he went to Boipatong and was part of the attack and indeed he took part in the attack?  I think the point has been made. I gather that you're going to give us some documentation to support what you're saying, and that is that he had three firearms issued to him and he says on the one hand that he only had two.  He's given us an explanation yesterday as to how that occurred.  Can you take the matter any further, because I think all that you need to do is just to provide us with the documents which indicate that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> As you please Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, because I don't think we'll take the matter any further now, you've made the point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The question I want to ask you Mr Mthembu is, why were you applying for so many weapons and why were you making application in June of 1992 for another weapon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Sir, the reason for applying for these licences was for self-protection where I resided and also in the streets.</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And for that you needed more than one gun?</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I applied for two because I needed them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Let me continue with this affidavit.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a>"I am aware that other members of other units who were also trained in the use of weapons"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I don't have any comment on that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a>MR BERGER</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a>"I have seen many arms and ammunition stored in the Kwamadala Hostel"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I don't have any knowledge of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well let me refer you to page 6 of your amnesty application, page 6 of the bundle, paragraph 7.  You say there</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a>"Vanana Zulu was in control of the weapons at Kwamadala Hostel.  The weapons that I can recall were AK47's.  There were more or less 20 and hand weapons.  There were more or less 8 to 10 that I saw.  These weapons were brought to the Kwamadala Hostel by Xoltlo from Vosloorus"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> That so correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Do you confirm that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well then why do you dispute the sentence which I just read out to you</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a>"I have seen many arms and ammunition stored at the Kwamadala Hostel"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I don't understand where you get that from or where it comes from.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The difficulty that you have there Mr Berger is this, you're reading a document in which the person who made that statement claims that he saw these firearms.  Now when the witness says: "I can't comment, I don't know about that", he may well be saying: "I don't know whether there person saw those weapons".  Do you see the difficulty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Perhaps my question was too loose.</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, indeed, indeed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You do know about arms and ammunition stored at the Kwamadala Hostel do you not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, Sir, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> For how long had those arms been stored at Kwamadala?  Since you arrived were there arms or was it only after you arrived?</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I would not know about that because when I arrived there were already residents at Kwamadala Hostel and I did not know whether they were already stored there or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> When did you become aware of the fact that arms were being stored at Kwamadala Hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I first knew because I saw them when we went to attack Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Was that the first time that you became aware that weapons were being stored at Kwamadala Hostel, the night of the attack on Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, that is correct Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Before that night, before the 17th of June 1992, you were not aware of any arms that were being stored at Kwamadala Hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Let me read to you what you say in paragraph 8, page 6</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a>"These weapons were kept by Vanana Zulu and he hid them away.  I saw these weapons when they were handed to us by Vanana Zulu one by one"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a>Are you saying that that is on the night of the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No, I am trying to explain here that I saw the weapons on the night or on the evening that we were supposed to attack Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes, but when you say in your affidavit</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a>"These weapons were kept by Vanana Zulu and he hid them away"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> When are you referring to, when did he hide them away?</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I am speaking of the period of when the weapons arrived at Kwamadala Hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And when was that period?</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Prior to the attack on Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So prior to the attack on Boipatong you  were aware that weapons were being hidden in the hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Although I cannot explain it but I think there were because we were then supposed to attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you saying that because these firearms were handed out to you on the night of the attack, you assume that they must have always been there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a>END OF TAPE - POSSIBLE WORDS LOST</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> ...[inaudible]</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is there a person called Damarra Chonco.</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Damarra Chonco, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well in paragraph 6 of your affidavit you referred to a person by the name of Damarra Chonco.</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is his surname, is it Gonku or Chonco?</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> It's Chonco.</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So there's a mistake here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Alright.  Vanana Zulu, is it Vanana Zulu or is it Fanana Zulu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Vanana.</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Vanana: V-A?</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay, very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Mthembu, is it your evidence that nobody informed you prior to the attack on Boipatong that weapons were being purchased from the money that had been collected from you and other residents and that those weapons were being brought to Kwamadala?  Nobody informed you and you never became aware of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Nobody informed me about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you never became aware of that from anybody?</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> What I can explain is that I once saw Mr Chonco arriving in a car having these weapons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And that was many days before the attack on Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> It was shortly before the attack on Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Why then do you say that you assumed that weapons were kept at the hostel before the attack on Boipatong when in fact you knew that weapons had been brought to the hostel before the attack on Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> As I have already explained Sir, that I cannot be aware of everything that happens in that hostel because I had other things to do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Mthembu, isn't it correct that money was collected before the attack, well before the attack on Boipatong?  Money was collected from hostel residents at Kwamadala to buy guns?</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> That happened.  When I arrived there it was already happening at the hostel but I had no knowledge of what the money was being used for.</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Isn't it correct that at previous meetings before the attack on Boipatong, you were told that the money which had been collected from you, you being all the residents, had been used to purchase guns, weapons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> It is possible but I may not have been present at that meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I'm asking whether you were told at those meetings that the money you collected was being used to buy guns?</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> As I have already mentioned, I may not have been at that meeting when they were told.</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Let me read to you what you've said.  The question was put to you, page 20, paragraph 24</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a>"You allege that Damarra Chonco brought weapons from Vosloorus to Kwamadala"?</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a>Your answer at page 32, paragraph 24:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a>"Yes"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a>24.1</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a>"How do you know he brought weapons from Vosloorus"?</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a>Answer, page 32, paragraph 24.1:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a>"They told us at previous meetings that Mr Chonco went to buy weapons with our money that they collected from us.  He used his car and went to Vosloorus and we were supposed to pay him some more money for using his car"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a>How can you now say that you were not at those meetings and you can't say what was said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I say that because I know that, I may not have been present at the meetings and I may have heard about this from other people or from Mr Chonco himself after those meetings were held.</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Let me refer you to page 6, paragraph 8</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a>"I also saw many weapons during the police operation at the hostel.  When they were attacked the South African Police came to search the hostel and found a lot of firearms which they confiscated.  No weapons were left, which resulted in Vanana Zulu telling us that everybody had to contribute so that more weapons could be bought.  We had to pay R800 per person who were working at the time, for these weapons"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a>Were you not at that meeting either?</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I think I was present at that meeting because it is explained here, I was present at the meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And then after - and aren't those the previous meetings that you're referring to at page 32, paragraph 24.1?</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Mr Chairperson, may I just mention one thing, that this statement on page 6 and paragraph 8 is in regard to the Sebokeng attacks and those Sebokeng attacks occurred after the Boipatong attack.  I think that is why it reads</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a>"When they were attacked the South African Police came to search the hostel and found a lot of firearms which they confiscated"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a>This refers to the Sebokeng attack and not to the Boipatong attack.  The Boipatong attack only starts on page 8.</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, with respect, if my learned friend could allow the witness to answer those questions it would be far more useful.  He now has a perfect avenue for escape.</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The perfect avenue for - the issue is whether the question is permissable in the first place.  	What is the basis of your objection?</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> My objection is that it is clear from this statement that this first part was the affidavit that was annexed to the application for the Sebokeng matter, so this happened after the Boipatong massacre.  It must just be clear to the Committee, in my mind, that this has no bearing on what happened before the Boipatong attack.  This happened after the Boipatong attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> It's not clear from the statement at all Chairperson, that that is the position.</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> That is as far as I can take it Chairperson because as I say, this statement was initially attached to the Sebokeng matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, where does it indicate that it relates to the Sebokeng attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Unfortunately it does not because, it does not say that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> But on page 8 there is a heading that says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a>"The Boipatong Massacre"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a>and then it deals with the Boipatong Massacre.</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, at page 8 it deals with it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> And in paragraph 8 on page 6 it says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a>"When they were attacked the South African Police came to search the hostel and found a lot of firearms which they confiscated"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> There he speaks about the attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  Well unless you can indicate precisely what is the basis for the objection, I'm disposed to allow the question because it does seem to me that the statement itself does not purport to restrict itself to Sebokeng but on the contrary it appears to refer broadly to the situation which obtained in Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> As the Chairperson pleases.</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But I think you are perfectly entitled to re-examine the witness on the issues so as to clarify the matter that may well have been obscured by the vagueness of the statement, do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> I do, thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a>	Do you still remember the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a>Mr Berger, do you want to put the question again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I'll put the question Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Mthembu, page 6, paragraph 8 of your affidavit, you talk there about Mr Vanana Zulu telling after the police had confiscated guns from the hostel that money is required to purchase weapons and that you had to contribute R800 per person for those weapons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> As I've explained before, as it has been explained, this statement relates to the Sebokeng attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Let me ask you this, prior to the attack on Boipatong, were you aware that there were weapons in Kwamadala Hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No, I did not have knowledge of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you aware, prior to the attack on Boipatong, that certain monies were being collected and that the purpose of collecting those monies was to buy weapons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, I had knowledge of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you know whether these weapons were indeed purchased with that money?</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, I'm certain that they were bought.</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And this was well before the attack on Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Does that help you Mr Berger?</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Thank you Chairperson, it does.</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a>	Now Mr Mthembu, what I want to ask you is, and I'm talking about the period before the attack on Boipatong so we get no mistake about that, right, is it your evidence that Vanana Zulu was the person who was in control of the purchasing of weapons for Kwamadala Hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> That is not correct Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Who was the person in control of purchasing weapons for Kwamadala Hostel before the Boipatong attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Mr Chonco.</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Before the Boipatong attack, who was in control of the weapons at the Kwamadala Hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Mr Vanana Zulu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So Mr Vanana Zulu would call meetings, this is before the Boipatong attack, he would call meetings, he would say to the residents: "We need money to buy guns", those residents who were working would contribute, Vanana Zulu would then collect the money and give it to Mr Chonco, Mr Chonco would then go and purchase the guns and bring to the Kwamadala Hostel, is that the way it worked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And as far as you knew, Mr Chonco purchased those guns or got those guns from Vosloorus Hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> That is what you heard but you don't know precisely where the guns came from, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Where is Mr Vanana Zulu today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I do not know where he is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> He is alive is he not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, he's still alive.</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Who would know where he is today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I would not have knowledge of that because I am in custody.</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The last time that you saw Mr Vanana Zulu, where was he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I saw him for the last time on the other side down there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Where is there on the other side, I don't understand you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I'm talking about on the basement, that's where we meet when we arrive here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was that this week?</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Oh, he was here at the hearings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He saw him outside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I saw him outside not inside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And when was that that you saw him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> On Tuesday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Can you see if he's in the audience today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No, I don't see him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> At the time of the Boipatong attack, would it be correct to say that Mr Vanana Zulu was the most senior member of the IFP at Kwamadala Hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And is it also correct that he was not permanently resident in the Kwamadala Hostel at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I knew him to be a fulltime resident of the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Berger, when you are moving on to the point, will you indicate as there's one thing that I just want to clarify in regard to the purchase of the arms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a>	What work was Mr Vanana Zulu doing at that time, besides organising attacks?  What was he employed to do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> He was working for Iscor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> He was not one of your co-accused, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Do you know whether he is still working for Iscor?</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No, I don't know whether he is still working there or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Is it correct that from time to time before the Boipatong attack, Vanana Zulu would leave the hostel, go away for a couple of days and then return to the hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I have no knowledge about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, I'm going to come back now to this affidavit, so perhaps this would be an appropriate point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a>	Prior to the attack on Boipatong, had the police conducted any raids into the hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> The police used to come often to conduct raids in the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> During those raids, would the police confiscate firearms found in the hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Some of these things happened when I was at work and I would get the report back from work and I would be informed as to what they took and what they did not confiscate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you ever told?</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What?</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I was told that the police raided the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But were you ever told that they had confiscated firearms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I would not know.  The person who was telling me would actually just tell me and he would not give me all the necessary details.</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay.  You did witness did you not, some of the operations when the police would come to the hostel and confiscate firearms?  Well that's what you said in your affidavit, you say so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Sir, sometimes the police would come at different times.</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I understand that, but all I want to find out is, you say in paragraph 8 that</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a>"I saw many weapons during the police operations at the hostel.  When they were attacked the South African Police came to search the hostel and found a lot of firearms which they confiscated"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a>That's what I'm asking about, that's what you say,  that's true, right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now did this occur prior to the Boipatong attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay.  So once the police had come there to confiscate the firearms there were no firearms in the hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I would not have knowledge about that, as to whether they confiscated all the firearms or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If you know, if you don't know say so.  The confiscation of the weapons by the police, did it trigger the need to collect money so as to buy more weapons for the residents at the hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, that is correct Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a>	Following on from that Mr Mthembu, and let me just put you in the picture, this is now before the attack on Boipatong, after the police have confiscated weapons from the hostel and there is now a need to collect money to get more weapons right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, that is correct Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> It's at that point that there is a meeting and Mr Vanana Zulu then called upon the residents, including you, to contribute R800 if you are working so that guns can be purchased, right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you had no choice, you had to pay because otherwise you feared that you could have been killed by one of the members of the Umsinga contingent?</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> That is correct Sir, I also contributed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So this group of men form Umsinga, they were brought to the hostel and they were there to make sure that all the hostel residents were kept in check and did as they were told, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, that's correct Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Now the money that was collected, was that given to Mr Vanana Zulu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> It was given to Mr Chonco.</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Was Mr Chonco part of this unit from Umsinga?</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, that is correct Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You moved to the Kwamadala Hostel in 1990, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> That is correct Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You were also arrested by the police in 1990, were you not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> In 1990?</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No, I don't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> When was the first time that you were arrested by the police Mr Mthembu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In connection with what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> At all Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> This question I can explain.  Here you're talking about my being arrested for the first time.  I've been arrested several times and I cannot remember exactly when.</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Mthembu, let me go back to this affidavit.  I'm sorry, it's just been pointed out to me.  Mr Sibusiso Chonco, is he the same Mr Chonco that you referred to who was head of the Umsinga contingent?</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> The one that I am talking about is Damarra, I don't know about Sibusiso.</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You see, because I have a note here that you and a number of people including Mr Sibusiso Chonco were arrested by the police in 1990, that's why I asked you about that arrest but you say that you can't remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> As I have explained Sir, that I do not remember because you are talking about 1990.  If you calculate from 1990 up to now, really I don't know how many years.  I do not record things as they happen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> All that you're being asked about now is Sibusiso Chonco.  Is Sibusiso Chonco the same person as Damarra Chonco, to your knowledge?</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> As far as I know I did explain Sir, I indicated the I know Damarra Chonco, not Sibusiso.  Maybe he is a different person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> There is a document in front of him which indicates that in 1990 you were arrested together with the person names Sibusiso Chonco.  You don't recall that incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No, I don't recall that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did it happen that from 1990 onwards, as you've said the police used to raid Kwamadala Hostel at various intervals, did it happen during one of those raids that you were arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> What I still remember is that I was arrested at night in 1993 when the police came.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a>MR BERGER:   Alright, let me go back to this affidavit.  "After the sentence I have seen many arms and ammunition stored at the Kwamadala Hostel"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a>is the sentence.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a>"Meetings were held every Tuesday and Thursday"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a>Is that correct Mr Mthembu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> On what page is that Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You won't find that in the page before you, I'm reading from another affidavit.  I'm asking you, is it correct that every Tuesday and every Thursday meetings were held at the Kwamadala Hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> We used to hold youth meetings on those days.</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Every Tuesday and every Thursday?</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> It goes on</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a>"At these meetings we were informed when new weapons had arrived"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I do not have knowledge about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yesterday you told the Committee that you only had meetings three times a month.</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I was giving you an example that we might perhaps hold meetings three times a month.  On Tuesdays and Wednesdays we sometimes never had an opportunity or for some reason not hold the meeting when we were supposed to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I just asked you whether meetings were held every Tuesday and every Thursday and you said yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, I did admit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Mthembu, why is it that you are so reluctant to impart information all the time?  If you had meetings every Tuesday and every Thursday, why yesterday did you tell the Committee that you met three times a month?</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> You must also understand that you are asking me about something that happened some years ago.</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And why also yesterday did you say that your meetings were just the three of you, you, the chairperson and the secretary when now it seems that they were youth meetings every Tuesday and every Thursday?</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Now you are asking me something which I really cannot answer, you are asking me about something that had already happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well yesterday you mentioned that there were the three of you, I think Mr Buthelezi, yourself and Ntzwee was the other person.  Did the three of you meet separately from the rest of the members of the youth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> We used to meet with the other youth members, we did not hold our own separate meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So every time the three of you meet you also meet together with representatives of the youth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, that is correct Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So the three meetings that you estimated you had a month, you were referring to those meetings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, Sir, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now these meetings that you've just referred to now which were held every Tuesday and Thursday, who met at those meetings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> The whole youth would meet because they knew that we would hold meetings on Tuesdays and on Thursdays.</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> My question Mr Mthembu is why did you not mention any of this yesterday?</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I would not answer to something that has not been asked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I'll leave that answer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Would this perhaps be an appropriate time to take the tea adjournment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> It would, thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, very well, we will take the tea adjournment now and we will return at eleven thirty.</p>

<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a>	Mr Mthembu, is it not correct that Sibusiso Chonco and Damarra Chonco are the same person, one and the same person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> What I can say is I do not know whether it is the same person because I have just spoken of Damarra Chonco.</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think what counsel is asking you is whether, is it not a fact that Damarra Chonco and Sibusiso Chonco is one and the same person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I do not know this name Sibusiso Chonco.</p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You knew Damarra Chonco from 1990 until 1993, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And the two of you were in the same unit, is that correct?</p>

<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> He was not in the youth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And in the unit that you spoke about earlier?  Do you remember you agreed with me that all residents were split up into units, was he in that unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That is now in the unit in which he belonged?</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> His unit as I understand, consisted of himself, Buthelezi and Ntzwee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Oh, it's my mistake, I apologise for that Mr Mthembu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> As I under Chonco, Chonco was the leader of the Umsinga contingent.</p>

<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And it was in that capacity as leader of this Umsinga contingent that you knew him from 1990?</p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Do you know of a person called Darkie Chonco?</p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Who is he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> He is Damarra Chonco's youngest brother.</p>

<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Is he sitting in this hall?</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>

<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> There he is.</p>

<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And the person who has just stood up now, Mr Vanana Zulu, he was sitting in that same seat just before the adjournment, is that not correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I did not see him before the break.</p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> At the break he came up to speak to you, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, I was with him outside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And what did he tell you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> He greeted me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What else did he tell you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> He did not say anything else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> How long did you spend with him outside?</p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> It was not for long, I was with my co-accused at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And all he did was greet you and say nothing more?</p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, he just greeted me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I saw Mr Vanana Zulu having a long conversation at the foot of the stage, are you aware of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> At the stairs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes, just after the adjournment, Mr Vanana Zulu came up to where you and all the applicants were sitting and had a conversation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Maybe you saw somebody else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Are you saying that you have had no conversation with Mr Vanana Zulu today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Berger, he has just told us that during the tea adjournment he spoke to Mr Zulu, you can put that question.  If you want to find out whether there was a discussion with Mr Zulu inside the hall, that's probably the way you should put it unless you want to make a distinction between just greeting and a conversation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well that was my understanding.</p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay, very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a>	Do you understand the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I understand the question that Mr Berger is asking but he is not satisfied with my response and I do not know how to respond to his question so that he is satisfied.</p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Then I'll be more specific.  Other than Mr Vanana Zulu greeting you, you have not had any other conversation with Mr Vanana Zulu today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Because of the short time that we have and because I had to speak to the other people as well, I did not speak to him for long.  The mere fact that he greeted me means something to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Besides the greeting, what else did Mr Vanana Zulu say to you either inside the hall or outside the hall?</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> There is nothing that he said to me.  I did not see him in the hall but he spoke to me at the basement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Mr Chairman, may I pose just one question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a>	Mr Mthembu, you also said on Tuesday when you arrived you saw him in the basement, did he speak to you on Tuesday?</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, he did speak to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Did you have a lengthy discussion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> We did not speak for long because there are some of my co-accused whom I haven't seen for a long time, therefore I have to speak to each and everyone of them and I cannot concentrate on one person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a>	Let me go back to this affidavit.  I'm sorry there is something else I have to put to you about Mr Vanana Zulu.  You said that Mr Vanana Zulu was not part of the attack on Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> How do you know that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I know because he was not there, he had gone home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> How do you know that?  Did he tell you that before he left: "I'm going home"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> He did not tell me but I saw him when he left in the car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> When did he leave the hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Although I cannot specify the time, but it was on a Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> On Wednesday the 17th of June 1992?</p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, that is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So you're saying he left the hostel a few hours before the attack started?</p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> As I've just explained he left in the afternoon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And where did he go?  You say to his family, my question is: "Where"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just before you opt, when you want to move onto the next point would you just indicate as there's a matte that I just want to raise, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Mthembu, I asked you a question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> He went home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> My question is, where was his home?</p>
<p class="line" id="line546"><a name="pos546"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> That's Nongoma in KwaZulu Natal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did he tell you: "I'm going home to Nongoma"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line548"><a name="pos548"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> He did not tell me that he was going to Nongoma, but what I know is that if a person uses these taxis to Nongoma, he must be going home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> But you never saw him using a taxi did you, you saw him leaving in his car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> These taxis to Nongoma park outside the hostel so when he got into one I knew that he must be going home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> No, you told the Committee that he got into his car and left the hostel that Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I do not understand what you mean.  I meant that he got into the taxi, the car that I was talking about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Why did you then tell the Committee that he got into his car and drove away from the hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I did not say that he got into his car, I am only hearing it from you that he has his own car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Isn't it correct that Mr Vanana Zulu has family in Boipatong or had family in Boipatong at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> At what time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> June 1992.</p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I don't know about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Isn't it correct that Mr Vanana Zulu was involved in the attack on Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I have no comment on that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I can tell you that there is a witness who can say that he was in Boipatong that night, in fact he went into a house which was occupied by one of his co-workers at Iscor and the owner of the house said: "Why are you coming to kill me", and Vanana Zulu left that house.  You are absolutely certain that Vanana Zulu wasn't in Boipatong that night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, I am certain.</p>
<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> He wasn't at the stadium and he wasn't part of the attacking group, of that you are certain?</p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No, I did not see him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Who then was in control of the guns at Kwamadala Hostel when Vanana Zulu wasn't there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line566"><a name="pos566"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I would not know who was responsible for that Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, perhaps at this point you would care to clear up that point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line568"><a name="pos568"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a>	Mr Vanana Zulu, would you please stand up Sir.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line570"><a name="pos570"></a>MR VANANA ZULU STANDS UP</p>
<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> To the extent that there may be allegations made in these proceedings against you, you have the right to be present at these hearings and to dispute any such allegations that are made against you and if you so wish, to engage a legal representative to represent you.  Do you understand those rights?</p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a><span class="speaker">MR ZULU:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Mr Chairman, if I might come in here.  I am under the understanding - a number of notices have been sent to the IFP of implicated persons, I have been brought under the understanding that Mr Frederich, the representatives there on the other side are handling a watching brief for these persons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, we would like to clarify this with Mr Vanana Zulu.  For that purpose we would seek a short adjournment or we can resolve the situation after the adjournment at half past one but if it's important, if the Chairperson feels that we must sort it out now, I would ask for a short adjournment to sort it out now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think it is, so that if we do proceed we are at least assured that if Mr Zulu desires to be legally represented there is at least someone to look after his interests.</p>
<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I agree with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  We will take a very short adjournment of about five minutes and then we will return to the hall to enable counsel to take instructions, if any from Mr Zulu as to his desire or otherwise to be represented, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a><span class="speaker">VICTOR MTHEMBU:</span> (s.u.o.)</p>
<p class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, my attorney has been instructed to appear on behalf of Mr Vanana Zulu, to look after his interests as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Zulu, you do confirm that do you?  Mr Zulu you do confirm that you now are legally represented in these proceedings?  We have been told that you are now represented.   Yes, thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a>	Thank you Mr Strydom.</p>
<p class="line" id="line585"><a name="pos585"></a>	Mr Berger, would you proceed please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line586"><a name="pos586"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Thank you Chairperson.  Chairperson, following on from what was said just before the adjournment, if Mr Strydom and his attorney have a watching brief for the IFP and for other implicated persons, I would ask on behalf of the victims that that be disclosed to the Committee and that the names of the people on whose behalf there is a watching brief be disclosed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line588"><a name="pos588"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, we've been instructed to carry a watching brief for the IFP as well as members of the IFP possibly implicated in this matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line589"><a name="pos589"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a>RECORDING EQUIPMENT SWITCHED OFF</p>
<p class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Strydom, just something that concerns me, a whole range of people were given Section 19(4) notices relevant to these proceedings and it may just help me, I don't know if it would help the rest of the Committee, to know which of those people that received 19(4) notices you are acting for in a watching brief type capacity, i.e. just covering their interests.  You don't have to read them all out now, maybe you can just provide us with a schedule in due course but that may just help us know, I would simply like to know who specifically is represented and whose interests may not be covered so that we don't end up with a situation where someone's named at a later stage when we have to go through the same process again of just confirming that instruction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, I'm not aware of all the notices that have been sent out, that the names I have seen in relation to notices are: Mr Themba Khoza, Mr Humphrey Ndlovu, Mr Gobela.  Those are the names I can remember but I will make sure about that and I will let the Committee know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line593"><a name="pos593"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...[inaudible] understand the position  regardless of any notices that might have been issued, you are looking after the interests of the IFP and any members of the IFP who might be implicated in the course of these proceedings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line594"><a name="pos594"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> That is indeed so Chairperson, and in fact there was also a notice sent to the IFP as a party.</p>
<p class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line596"><a name="pos596"></a>RECORDING EQUIPMENT SWITCHED OFF</p>
<p class="line" id="line597"><a name="pos597"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You see Mr Strydom, what concerns me is just a general sense of representing people, you don't know whether they've actually instructed you or not and they may want someone else to represent them for all I know.  We've already had a problem with Mr Lukhozi which you alerted us to.  I'm just concerned that there may be conflicts of interest between different individuals and someone.  This sort of blanket mandate isn't very desirable.</p>
<p class="line" id="line598"><a name="pos598"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, I appear for the IFP and the members of the IFP on a watching brief basis and not in any other capacity and that is why I initially did not place that on record because I don't see the need to place yourself on record if you just carry a watching brief.</p>
<p class="line" id="line599"><a name="pos599"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> That's fine, let's leave it at that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line600"><a name="pos600"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Please proceed Mr Berger.</p>
<p class="line" id="line601"><a name="pos601"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line602"><a name="pos602"></a>	Mr Mthembu, could you turn please to page 6 of the papers, paragraph 8.  You say there:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line603"><a name="pos603"></a>"These weapons were kept by Vanana Zulu and he hid them away.  I saw these weapons when they were handed to us by Vanana Zulu one by one"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line604"><a name="pos604"></a>Do you see that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line605"><a name="pos605"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line606"><a name="pos606"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> When did this take place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line607"><a name="pos607"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> What I explained here relates to another era and not for what we are here about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line608"><a name="pos608"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> When did this take place is my question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line609"><a name="pos609"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I am explaining about something that happened at some other time.  As my lawyer had explained, this did not happen when we went to attack Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line610"><a name="pos610"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I'm asking you a simple question, I'm just asking you to say when it happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line611"><a name="pos611"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> It happened at another time.  I cannot be specific about the date.  There was - I thought we were talking or we were discussing Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line612"><a name="pos612"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was it before or after the attack on Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line613"><a name="pos613"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> After the Boipatong attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line614"><a name="pos614"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Who handed out the weapons on the night of the Boipatong attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line615"><a name="pos615"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I would not know because I knew Mr Chonco to be responsible for the weapons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line616"><a name="pos616"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Are you saying you did not see anybody hand out any weapons on the night of the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line617"><a name="pos617"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No, I did not see anybody.</p>
<p class="line" id="line618"><a name="pos618"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I'm going back now to that affidavit I was reading from.  The last sentence we read, just to put you in the picture, said</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line619"><a name="pos619"></a>"At these meetings"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line620"><a name="pos620"></a>those are the Tuesday and Thursday meetings.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line621"><a name="pos621"></a>"we were informed when new weapons had arrived"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line622"><a name="pos622"></a>We've dealt with that.  It goes on to say:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line623"><a name="pos623"></a>"The arms are brought by members of the Inkatha Freedom Party who arrive at the hostel from Natal.  I have seen them arrive with AK47's and spears with poison tips"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line624"><a name="pos624"></a>Do you know anything about this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line625"><a name="pos625"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line626"><a name="pos626"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You have never witnessed or heard of members of the IFP bringing weapons to the hostel, Kwamadala, from Natal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line627"><a name="pos627"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No, I did not see it Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line628"><a name="pos628"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> It continues - I'm sorry, as far as you're concerned all the weapons came from Vosloorus?</p>
<p class="line" id="line629"><a name="pos629"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line630"><a name="pos630"></a>MR BERGER</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line631"><a name="pos631"></a>"Some of those who arrived come to the area to work.  However others come to carry out missions and attacks in the local township.  Others come to bring arms and then leave"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line632"><a name="pos632"></a>Do you know anything about people who came to carry out missions and attacks in the local township?</p>
<p class="line" id="line633"><a name="pos633"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No, I have no knowledge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line634"><a name="pos634"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Do you have any knowledge of any missions other than the - I'm not talking now about the Boipatong Massacre on the 17th of June 1992, do you have knowledge of any missions, whether by you or whether by anybody else, where attacks were carried out in the local township?</p>
<p class="line" id="line635"><a name="pos635"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> At that time there were many incidents that occurred that we would hear about on the radio.  These attacks took place in the townships.</p>
<p class="line" id="line636"><a name="pos636"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did the people from Umsinga ever go out on their own to carry out attacks in the local township?</p>
<p class="line" id="line637"><a name="pos637"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I would not have knowledge of that Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line638"><a name="pos638"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> At any time I'm talking about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line639"><a name="pos639"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> As I have mentioned that I cannot have or I do not have knowledge of it, I mean that exactly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line640"><a name="pos640"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Do you have knowledge of any members of the Umsinga contingent going out of the hostel at any time to shoot at the ANC or to shoot at members of the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line641"><a name="pos641"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No, I do not have knowledge about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line642"><a name="pos642"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> At any stage they went out, you have no knowledge?</p>
<p class="line" id="line643"><a name="pos643"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No, I do not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line644"><a name="pos644"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Please have a look at page 14, paragraph 29.  You say there</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line645"><a name="pos645"></a>"The hitsquad of Umsinga also went out several times on their own initiative to shoot members of the ANC"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line646"><a name="pos646"></a>What do you say about that Mr Mthembu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line647"><a name="pos647"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What paragraph are you referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line648"><a name="pos648"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Paragraph 29 at the bottom of page 14.</p>
<p class="line" id="line649"><a name="pos649"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Before you answer that, does this relate to the Boipatong incident or is it a subject of another application for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line650"><a name="pos650"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Mr Chairperson, may just say that on page 14 there is a heading</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line651"><a name="pos651"></a>"1993"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line652"><a name="pos652"></a>It relates to things that happened in 1993 in the Sebokeng area.  If that is of any help.</p>
<p class="line" id="line653"><a name="pos653"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, Mr Berger?</p>
<p class="line" id="line654"><a name="pos654"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, first of all when this ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line655"><a name="pos655"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You can put the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line656"><a name="pos656"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Mthembu, do you remember the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line657"><a name="pos657"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes.  What you actually asking about has nothing to do with the reason why we are here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line658"><a name="pos658"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You see Mr Mthembu, the paragraph that has just been read over to you, that's were you say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line659"><a name="pos659"></a>"The hitsquad in Umsinga also went out several times on their own initiative to shoot members of the ANC"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line660"><a name="pos660"></a>That's what he's asking you about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line661"><a name="pos661"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line662"><a name="pos662"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, what is your answer to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line663"><a name="pos663"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, it did happen but it has nothing to do with why we are here today.</p>
<p class="line" id="line664"><a name="pos664"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Mthembu, when you gave your evidence on Monday you were very careful to point out that pages 4 to 8 concern the Sebokeng attack and that pages 8 to 17 concern the Boipatong Massacre.  More than that, I was very careful in the way that I asked you the question and I think on more than one occasion I said to you that my question related to at: "any time".  I asked you: "At any time, did the members of the Umsinga contingent go out on their own initiative to shoot members of the ANC", and you said: "No".  Do you recall that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line665"><a name="pos665"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, I do, but if you look from page 8 to page 12 it is specified that that is the Boipatong Massacre.</p>
<p class="line" id="line666"><a name="pos666"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Why did you say: "At not time did the members of the Umsinga contingent go out on their own initiative to shoot members of the ANC"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line667"><a name="pos667"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Mr Berger, this happened a long time ago.  I am not like a computer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line668"><a name="pos668"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> To go back to this affidavit that I'm reading from, will you now agree with the sentence which reads</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line669"><a name="pos669"></a>"However"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line670"><a name="pos670"></a>Well let me go one sentence back:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line671"><a name="pos671"></a>"Some of those who arrived come to the area to work.  However others come to carry out missions and attacks in the local township"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line672"><a name="pos672"></a>Will you now agree with that sentence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line673"><a name="pos673"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I will not agree with something that I do not know about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line674"><a name="pos674"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> When according to you did the members of the Umsinga contingent begin their initiatives, going out to shoot members of the ANC, when did that start?</p>
<p class="line" id="line675"><a name="pos675"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I do not know when that began.</p>
<p class="line" id="line676"><a name="pos676"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The Umsinga contingent arrived in 1990 you told us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line677"><a name="pos677"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I arrived at Kwamadala Hostel in 1990 and that's when I saw them.  I do not know when they arrived at the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line678"><a name="pos678"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Then just for clarity Mr Mthembu, is the reference on page 14 to a hitsquad also a typing mistake?</p>
<p class="line" id="line679"><a name="pos679"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> There is not a mistake but you should be careful of the year that is being referred to.  The year in this page is 1993.</p>
<p class="line" id="line680"><a name="pos680"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So in 1993 they were a hitsquad?</p>
<p class="line" id="line681"><a name="pos681"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line682"><a name="pos682"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> In 1992 they were a self-defence unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line683"><a name="pos683"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> ...[no English translation]</p>
<p class="line" id="line684"><a name="pos684"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Self-protection unit Mr Mthembu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line685"><a name="pos685"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> That is one and the same thing that we are talking about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line686"><a name="pos686"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> A self-protection unit, I beg your pardon.  Are you saying that a self-protecting unit and a hitsquad is the same thing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line687"><a name="pos687"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> ...[no reply]</p>
<p class="line" id="line688"><a name="pos688"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Sorry Interpreters, the question was: "Are  you saying that a self-protection unit and a hitsquad are the same thing"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line689"><a name="pos689"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> It was asked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line690"><a name="pos690"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> It didn't come through for some reason, maybe you forgot to press the button.  Would you just repeat it please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line691"><a name="pos691"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> In my opinion I think we may use the self-protection unit and no the word: "hitsquad".</p>
<p class="line" id="line692"><a name="pos692"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Mthembu, let's please try and get some certainty on this.  On page 14, paragraph 29 you again use the word: "hitsquad".  You told the Committee that is not an error, you meant to use the word: "hitsquad", correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line693"><a name="pos693"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> We spoke about this yesterday.  I don't know whether you do not understand it correctly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line694"><a name="pos694"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> After you said to the Committee: "This was not a mistake", this particular one when I asked you, you then said: "But it's the time that I'm referring to.  I'm referring to a later time".  My question to you then was: "The contingent from Umsinga that you call a hitsquad in 1993, you call a self-protection unit in 1992 but it's the same thing", am I correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line695"><a name="pos695"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> As I explained that this was a typing error.  It was the self-protection unit, not that it changed in 1993, it was still the self-protection unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line696"><a name="pos696"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So this at the bottom of page 14 is a typing error?</p>
<p class="line" id="line697"><a name="pos697"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line698"><a name="pos698"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The affidavit then continues</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line699"><a name="pos699"></a>"During the four months that I have lived at the Kwamadala Hostel I have seen units being sent out on missions, however I have not known exactly where they have been sent to or what missions they have carried out"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line700"><a name="pos700"></a>I take it you can't comment on that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line701"><a name="pos701"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No, I have no knowledge of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line702"><a name="pos702"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The rest of the affidavit deals with the attack on the 15th of March 1992, and you've already told the Committee you have no knowledge of that.  I just want to ask you one thing, there's an allegation here that the unit members were given arms by Buthelezi. Do you know of any Buthelezi who had access to the arms which were stored at Kwamadala Hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line703"><a name="pos703"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I have no knowledge about that person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line704"><a name="pos704"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> As far as your co-applicant Thembelani Buthelezi is concerned, he did not have access to the guns and the weapons stored at the Kwamadala Hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line705"><a name="pos705"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I have no knowledge about that, I only knew him to be the Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line706"><a name="pos706"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well, he was also part of your unit, you would have known if he had access to guns would you not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line707"><a name="pos707"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No, I would not have known.</p>
<p class="line" id="line708"><a name="pos708"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> On the night of the massacre, 17 June 1992, you say you did not see any guns being handed out, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line709"><a name="pos709"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line710"><a name="pos710"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you see any people carrying guns that night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line711"><a name="pos711"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Apart from those who were in his company which he has already told us about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line712"><a name="pos712"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line713"><a name="pos713"></a>	Apart from Mr Chonco and Mr Khanyile I believe it was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line714"><a name="pos714"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> As I've already explained before I had gone as part of the attack on the ANC and not to check maybe as a journalist as to who had what, who did what at what time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line715"><a name="pos715"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It would help us a great deal Mr Mthembu, if you just confine yourself to answering the question.  If you did not see any other persons carrying firearms please say so.  I think it will help us to shorten this proceeding, rather than to keep on making comments.</p>
<p class="line" id="line716"><a name="pos716"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I did not see anybody else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line717"><a name="pos717"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Let's get certainty Mr Mthembu.  Besides Mr Khanyile, besides Mr Chonco, you did not see any other person carrying any other firearm that night, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line718"><a name="pos718"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line719"><a name="pos719"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You did not see anybody carrying an AK47?</p>
<p class="line" id="line720"><a name="pos720"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No, I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line721"><a name="pos721"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Can I just object here, I just want to put something right.  Initially Mr Khanyile's name wasn't mentioned, it was Mr Mabote's name that was mentioned.  So it wasn't Khanyile, although his name was mentioned today but initially the name that was mentioned was Mabote.</p>
<p class="line" id="line722"><a name="pos722"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well Mr Mthembu, then let's get certainty on that.  Did you see Mr Mabote carrying a gun?</p>
<p class="line" id="line723"><a name="pos723"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line724"><a name="pos724"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What gun was he carrying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line725"><a name="pos725"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> He had a small gun.</p>
<p class="line" id="line726"><a name="pos726"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Chonco, he was carrying a gun?</p>
<p class="line" id="line727"><a name="pos727"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, he had a gun.</p>
<p class="line" id="line728"><a name="pos728"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What gun did he have?</p>
<p class="line" id="line729"><a name="pos729"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> An AK47.</p>
<p class="line" id="line730"><a name="pos730"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Khanyile was he carrying a gun?</p>
<p class="line" id="line731"><a name="pos731"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I don't remember what weapon he had.</p>
<p class="line" id="line732"><a name="pos732"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Alright.  Besides those three men you did not see anyone else carrying any gun the night of the attack, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line733"><a name="pos733"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> That is correct Sir, I did not see anybody else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line734"><a name="pos734"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> That is before, during or after the attack you did not see?</p>
<p class="line" id="line735"><a name="pos735"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line736"><a name="pos736"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Nobody?</p>
<p class="line" id="line737"><a name="pos737"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> There was no-one besides the ones that I have mentioned to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line738"><a name="pos738"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Let me read to you what you say at page 37, paragraph 6</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line739"><a name="pos739"></a>"We sang songs and we went out through the only main gate of Kwamadala Hostel.  We went straight under the bridge across the road and entered Boipatong.  All these people who came from Umsinga were holding the machine guns such as AK47 rifles"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line740"><a name="pos740"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I have just told you that Mr Chonco is the person who had the AK47.</p>
<p class="line" id="line741"><a name="pos741"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Mthembu, I'll read it again to you, the sentence that really concerns me and you will recall in your affidavit you said there were 40 to 50 people from Umsinga and in this paragraph you now say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line742"><a name="pos742"></a>"All these people who came from Umsinga were holding the machine guns such as AK47 rifles"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line743"><a name="pos743"></a>All, not Mr Chonco, all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line744"><a name="pos744"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I don't think you clarify this when you say 40 to 50 people.  What I know is that the 40 to 50 people were protecting the community of Kwamadala, not that all of them went to attack at Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line745"><a name="pos745"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mthembu, the point is this, you told us that the only persons that you saw carrying guns that night were the individuals that you've mentioned, I think you mentioned Mabote and another person.  Now in your affidavit you state that there people from Umsinga who were carrying machine guns, do you see the difference?</p>
<p class="line" id="line746"><a name="pos746"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line747"><a name="pos747"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That's what counsel wants you to explain.</p>
<p class="line" id="line748"><a name="pos748"></a>	Is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line749"><a name="pos749"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line750"><a name="pos750"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I'll explain that.  What happened is that I do not mean that all these people had guns but because Mr Chonco was one of the people from Umsinga he is the person that I saw carrying a gun but I cannot say that I saw the others with the guns because there were many people at that gathering.</p>
<p class="line" id="line751"><a name="pos751"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You see counsel wants to find out the following:  You told us that the only persons that you saw carrying firearms that night were the individuals that you've mentioned which about two I think it is, but in your affidavit you indicate that people from Umsinga as well also had firearms and you give the number as being, well, the point is that you also mention that there were people from Umsinga who also had machine guns.  In other words, it was not only these two individuals that you mentioned who had firearms but there were other people including the people from Umsinga who had firearms, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line752"><a name="pos752"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I did not fully understand whether you meant whether these people were present in the attack or were merely present residing at the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line753"><a name="pos753"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You gave us two individuals who you say had firearms, okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line754"><a name="pos754"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line755"><a name="pos755"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Apart from those two individuals were there any persons in the group that attacked Boipatong who had firearms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line756"><a name="pos756"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, there were other people who had guns but I cannot say who they were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line757"><a name="pos757"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So there were other individuals?</p>
<p class="line" id="line758"><a name="pos758"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, there were but I don't know who they are because it was at night and I could not see clearly who had what gun.</p>
<p class="line" id="line759"><a name="pos759"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> But you knew that those people that had the guns were the people from Umsinga.</p>
<p class="line" id="line760"><a name="pos760"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Not only the people from Umsinga were launching the attack but many of us from the hostel were also part of this attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line761"><a name="pos761"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Mthembu, in paragraph 6 you state as a fact that the people from Umsinga were holding AK47's, all of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line762"><a name="pos762"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> To correct you Mr Berger, he says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line763"><a name="pos763"></a>"They were holding machine guns like AK47's"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line764"><a name="pos764"></a>So there might have been other kinds of machine guns but  I just don't want to put wrong words in his mouth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line765"><a name="pos765"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Thank you Mr Lax.</p>
<p class="line" id="line766"><a name="pos766"></a>	The people from Umsinga, all of them you saw were holding machine guns?</p>
<p class="line" id="line767"><a name="pos767"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Mr Berger, you don't understand, not only the people from Umsinga were going out on this attack, that you should know.  We went there in large numbers.  I'm talking here about residents from Kwamadala Hostel, they went out the attack.  I don't know really what it is that you want.</p>
<p class="line" id="line768"><a name="pos768"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Are you saying that the only person you saw with an AK47 was Mr Chonco or are you saying that you saw many people carrying AK47's?</p>
<p class="line" id="line769"><a name="pos769"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Sir, I am saying here that some of the people in our company had guns but the one person that I saw with an AK47 was Mr Chonco and I therefore cannot answer to other people carrying guns when I did not see the guns.</p>
<p class="line" id="line770"><a name="pos770"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Please listen carefully to my question.  Did you that night either before, during or after the attack, see a lot of AK47's?</p>
<p class="line" id="line771"><a name="pos771"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line772"><a name="pos772"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Where did you see them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line773"><a name="pos773"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> At the stadium.</p>
<p class="line" id="line774"><a name="pos774"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Who was carrying them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line775"><a name="pos775"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> They were on the ground, nobody was carrying them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line776"><a name="pos776"></a>END OF TAPE - POSSIBLE WORDS LOST</p>
<p class="line" id="line777"><a name="pos777"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> They were sprinkled with some traditional medicine and others took the guns away and we went out on the attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line778"><a name="pos778"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Who took the guns when you went out on the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line779"><a name="pos779"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I would not have knowledge of that Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line780"><a name="pos780"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> There were people that you saw taking these guns but you don't know who they were, is that what you're saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line781"><a name="pos781"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Sir, I am trying to explain here that as the people were leaving the stadium to go and attack I was also concentrating on what I had to do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line782"><a name="pos782"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Let me come back to the beginning then Mr Mthembu.  Why when I asked you whether you saw anybody carrying a firearm that night, either before, during or after the attack, did you not mention the men from Umsinga who you saw holding machine guns?  Why didn't you mention that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line783"><a name="pos783"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I don't know really what you want me to say now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line784"><a name="pos784"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Mthembu, I'm putting to you once again that you are deliberately being selective with what you disclose.  You are deliberately holding back relevant information relating to the Boipatong attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line785"><a name="pos785"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Mr Berger, I came before this Commission here because I want reconciliation between myself and the residents of Boipatong.  There is nothing else that I am holding back.  I am just disclosing here what information I have.</p>
<p class="line" id="line786"><a name="pos786"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> When I asked you to disclose the various committees to the Committee, the various committees at Kwamadala, you mentioned the Senior Committee, you mentioned the Youth Committee, we've now dealt with the hitsquads, I want to ask you about another committee, the Amabutho, do you know about them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line787"><a name="pos787"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No, I don't know them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line788"><a name="pos788"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Have you heard the word: "Amabutho"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line789"><a name="pos789"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I did hear the name before back home.  There is a place where these Amabutho gather.</p>
<p class="line" id="line790"><a name="pos790"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Is that the only meaning that you can attach to the word: "Amabutho", it's a place where certain people gather in Natal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line791"><a name="pos791"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line792"><a name="pos792"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You don't know that Amabutho means warriors?</p>
<p class="line" id="line793"><a name="pos793"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No, I don't know about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line794"><a name="pos794"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Mthembu, is Zulu not your mother tongue?</p>
<p class="line" id="line795"><a name="pos795"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> It is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line796"><a name="pos796"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Do you know Mr Bhekinkosi Mkhize?</p>
<p class="line" id="line797"><a name="pos797"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, I know him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line798"><a name="pos798"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Was he not the leader of the Amabutho at the Kwamadala Hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line799"><a name="pos799"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I don't know whether he was a leader or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line800"><a name="pos800"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Was he a member of the Amabutho at the Kwamadala Hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line801"><a name="pos801"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I don't know Sir.  As I have explained, I really don't know whether he was a member or not.  It was not my duty to know what he was and what he was not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line802"><a name="pos802"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Were you a member of the Amabutho at the Kwamadala Hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line803"><a name="pos803"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> As I have explained Sir, that I was a member of the youth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line804"><a name="pos804"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Do I understand your evidence that you know absolutely nothing about the Amabutho at the Kwamadala Hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line805"><a name="pos805"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, I don't have knowledge to that effect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line806"><a name="pos806"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And if Mr Mkhize says that the Amabutho are a senior committee of the IFP, you will say you know nothing about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line807"><a name="pos807"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, I know nothing about this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line808"><a name="pos808"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And if he says that Mr Damarra Chonco was a member of the Amabutho you have no knowledge of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line809"><a name="pos809"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line810"><a name="pos810"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> There was a committee in Kwamadala which was referred to as the Senior Committee, were you aware of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line811"><a name="pos811"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, I know that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line812"><a name="pos812"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What was the Zulu word for that Committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line813"><a name="pos813"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I don't have a word or a name.  I don't know how to put it.  I don't have an alternative in isiZulu.  It was a Senior Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line814"><a name="pos814"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I do understand ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line815"><a name="pos815"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> ...[no English translation]</p>
<p class="line" id="line816"><a name="pos816"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that how it was referred to, ...[indistinct]?</p>
<p class="line" id="line817"><a name="pos817"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I am referring to it as a Senior Committee.  For example when a meeting was to be held these are the people who had to give us permission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line818"><a name="pos818"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It didn't have any specific name apart from being referred to as a Senior Committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line819"><a name="pos819"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No, I don't have knowledge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line820"><a name="pos820"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Is it your evidence that Mr Mkhize was not a leader in the hostel, Bhekinkosi Mkhize?</p>
<p class="line" id="line821"><a name="pos821"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I don't understand Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line822"><a name="pos822"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You remember yesterday I asked you for the names of the leaders in the hostel.  You told the Committee that Mr Khumalo and Mr Vanana Zulu were the leaders of the Senior Committee, you told the Committee that Mr Buthelezi, Mr Mthembu, yourself, and Ntzwee were the leaders of the Youth Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line823"><a name="pos823"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line824"><a name="pos824"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> According to you there are no other committees, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line825"><a name="pos825"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, I don't know of any other committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line826"><a name="pos826"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So I'm asking you, is it your evidence that Mr Mkhize was not a leader within the hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line827"><a name="pos827"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line828"><a name="pos828"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> No, he was not or no, that was not your evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line829"><a name="pos829"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I mean as far as I know yesterday I mentioned people's names whom I knew were in the committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line830"><a name="pos830"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you know Mr Mkhize?</p>
<p class="line" id="line831"><a name="pos831"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, I know him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line832"><a name="pos832"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Let me read to you what he says at page 70, paragraph 4.2</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line833"><a name="pos833"></a>"The political structures were the senior men and the youth.  The political structures had nothing to do with the management structure in the hostel"</blockquote>

<blockquote class="line" id="line835"><a name="pos835"></a>"The youth was responsible for the organisation of rallies whilst the senior structure was responsible for discipline within the IFP party as well a decision making that relates to the IFP within the hostel"</blockquote>

<p class="line" id="line837"><a name="pos837"></a>You never knew that, is that your evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line838"><a name="pos838"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No, I didn't know that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line839"><a name="pos839"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> According to you, who was the leader of the IFP in the hostel?</p>

<p class="line" id="line841"><a name="pos841"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> As far as you knew, Mr Bhekinkosi Mkhize held no position of leadership in the hostel at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line842"><a name="pos842"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line843"><a name="pos843"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And yet according to you he was one of two people who gave the instruction to attack Boipatong.  How is that possible Mr Mthembu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line844"><a name="pos844"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> That is possible because our own people were dying, he too may have said that we should go out and attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line845"><a name="pos845"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Who made the decision to attack Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line846"><a name="pos846"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I can explain here that decisions were taken by each one person who had already suffered, any Kwamadala Resident.  They knew how people were being necklaced and there had come a time to show the people of Boipatong that we too were human just like them and we could not stand aloof as our people were being necklaced.</p>
<p class="line" id="line847"><a name="pos847"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Mthembu, who made the decision to attack this Vaal community?</p>
<p class="line" id="line848"><a name="pos848"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> It was Mr Chonco.</p>
<p class="line" id="line849"><a name="pos849"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> At page 19 you were asked the question, paragraph 17.1</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line850"><a name="pos850"></a>"Who made the decision to attack a Vaal community"?</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line851"><a name="pos851"></a>Your answer, page 29, paragraph 17.1:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line852"><a name="pos852"></a>"To my best knowledge Mr Vanana Zulu and Mkhize made the decision to attack the Vaal community"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line853"><a name="pos853"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> You are talking about something else here, you are talking about the Vaal community, you're not talking about the Boipatong matter anymore.</p>
<p class="line" id="line854"><a name="pos854"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Which decision are you referring to here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line855"><a name="pos855"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Here I am referring to - you asked me as to who took the decisions to attack the people in Boipatong and I explained to you and I really don't know how else you want me to explain here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line856"><a name="pos856"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You say that this answer at page 29 relates to another decision, not the decision to attack Boipatong.  I'm asking you which decision is this now that you are referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line857"><a name="pos857"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Here I am referring to the decision to attack Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line858"><a name="pos858"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I'm talking about paragraph 17.1 where you say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line859"><a name="pos859"></a>"To my best knowledge, Mr Vanana Zulu and Mkhize made the decision to attack the Vaal community"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line860"><a name="pos860"></a>Let me ask you this question then, that decision that you are referring to in 17.1, when was it taken?</p>
<p class="line" id="line861"><a name="pos861"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Berger, I think in fairness to the witness please do point out that the response that occurs at the pages that you've drawn his attention to are in response to questions which occurs on page 19.</p>
<p class="line" id="line862"><a name="pos862"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I've done that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line863"><a name="pos863"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  17.1 deals with the Vaal community.  17.2 deals with the Vaal community and then 17.3 then deals with Boipatong and then if you look at 17.3 he says in his statement</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line864"><a name="pos864"></a>"Mkhize became angry and agreed with Mr Chonco to attack the residents of Boipatong"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line865"><a name="pos865"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line866"><a name="pos866"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And that's how I understood his evidence so far, that the decision to attack Boipatong was taken by Chonco and Mkhize.</p>
<p class="line" id="line867"><a name="pos867"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, the question in 17.1 is</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line868"><a name="pos868"></a>"Who made the decision to attack a Vaal community"?</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line869"><a name="pos869"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well I don't know whether we can take the matter any further that this because it becomes clear here that a distinction is being made as to took the decision to attack which part.</p>
<p class="line" id="line870"><a name="pos870"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry Mr Mthembu, maybe you can just help us here.  A question was asked of you in the request for further particulars, referring to a Vaal community, you understand that, not the Vaal community, a specific Vaal community.  Which community did you understand you were replying to when you gave your lawyers instructions to answer that question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line871"><a name="pos871"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Here I was explaining about incidents that happened in the Vaal community, Boipatong included, Sebokeng included.  When we're talking about the Vaal community I think we are talking about the community in that area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line872"><a name="pos872"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Mr Berger's question is then to you, if you thought it was a general meeting at which a decision was taken to attack the Vaal community in general terms, when was that meeting?  That is what he's asking you.  It's not a meeting to attack Boipatong, it's a meeting to attack in general terms and you give a specific answer and he wants to know - and it will help us a great deal if you can help us, when was that meeting?  Which is different from the Boipatong specific meeting, on your evidence so far.  Can you help us there perhaps?</p>
<p class="line" id="line873"><a name="pos873"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I do not have knowledge about that meeting Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line874"><a name="pos874"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well then why do you say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line875"><a name="pos875"></a>"To my best knowledge, Mr Vanana Zulu and Mkhize made the decision to attack the Vaal community"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line876"><a name="pos876"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I am saying this because there were people who were older than us, that is at the hostel, and if they too had come to realise that it is enough, the pain is enough it was therefore upon themselves too to indicate that we should attack the people who were killing our people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line877"><a name="pos877"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So your leaders, am I right then, your leaders in the hostel took a decision at some time before the Boipatong attack, took a decision in general terms: "We are now going to launch attacks on the Vaal community, be it Sebokeng, Boipatong, Sharpeville, wherever.  In general, we are now going to launch attacks, the leaders decided that", correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line878"><a name="pos878"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Even though I did not hear them decide but everybody who was a resident at Kwamadala Hostel had already suffered a lot of harassment from the people or by the people at the Vaal community or of the Vaal community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line879"><a name="pos879"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> But you see Mr Mthembu, when you were asked a question and you understood that question meant a decision to attack the Vaal community, you identified two people, Vanana Zulu and Mkhize as being the people who took that decision.</p>
<p class="line" id="line880"><a name="pos880"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line881"><a name="pos881"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> My question to you is, why did you identify those two people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line882"><a name="pos882"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I am explaining this because Mr Zulu was in charge of us at the hostel and every hostel resident had grown tired of what was happening to them..</p>
<p class="line" id="line883"><a name="pos883"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You see Mr Mthembu it's really very simple, and I don't know why you don't want to say this, but if Mr Mkhize was not a leader why did you mention him in paragraph 17.1?</p>
<p class="line" id="line884"><a name="pos884"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I am referring to him here because he too was a resident at the hostel and he too was suffering the same pain at the hands of the township residents.</p>
<p class="line" id="line885"><a name="pos885"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You were not present when the decision to attack a Vaal community or the Vaal community was taken.</p>
<p class="line" id="line886"><a name="pos886"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line887"><a name="pos887"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You don't know who took that decision but you assumed that is must have been the senior people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line888"><a name="pos888"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, Sir, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line889"><a name="pos889"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who were in the position of leadership?</p>
<p class="line" id="line890"><a name="pos890"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> That is correct Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line891"><a name="pos891"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If that is so, Mkhize must have been a leader, he was a leader of what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line892"><a name="pos892"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> ...[no English translation]</p>
<p class="line" id="line893"><a name="pos893"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He was a leader of what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line894"><a name="pos894"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Mr Berger is reading here that he was a leader of Amabutho.</p>
<p class="line" id="line895"><a name="pos895"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But that's the assumption you made.</p>
<p class="line" id="line896"><a name="pos896"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> What I am saying here is because Mr Berger had just read to me from Mkhize's statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line897"><a name="pos897"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, I understand that but all I want to find out is this, the answer that you gave suggests that you were assuming that a decision to attack the Vaal community must have been taken by persons who were in a leadership position.  You do say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line898"><a name="pos898"></a>"To the best of your knowledge"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line899"><a name="pos899"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, that is according to my knowledge because the decision was taken by people at top ranks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line900"><a name="pos900"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, very well.  Now at the time you made that statement, in your mind what leadership position did Mr Mkhize hold at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line901"><a name="pos901"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> As far as I know I did not have knowledge about his position.</p>
<p class="line" id="line902"><a name="pos902"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay.  Was he an influential person perhaps within the Kwamadala Hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line903"><a name="pos903"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No, he was a respected person because he was an elderly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line904"><a name="pos904"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> He was an elderly person so he was respected?</p>
<p class="line" id="line905"><a name="pos905"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line906"><a name="pos906"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> But he was not a leader, he was not one of the leaders?</p>
<p class="line" id="line907"><a name="pos907"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> As far as I know Sir, as I have explained I did not have knowledge about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line908"><a name="pos908"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Mthembu, who were the commanders in chief of the attack on Boipatong on the 17th of June 1992?</p>
<p class="line" id="line909"><a name="pos909"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> As I have explained Sir, that Mr Chonco was the person who was in charge of the attack at Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line910"><a name="pos910"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And what about Mr Mkhize?  Was he in charge, also in charge of the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line911"><a name="pos911"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I have no knowledge.  What I can say is that he was present at the stadium where we were addressed about the fact that we were going to launch an attack on Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line912"><a name="pos912"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The question is simple Mr Mthembu, was Mr Mkhize a commander of the attack or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line913"><a name="pos913"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No, I don't have knowledge about that Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line914"><a name="pos914"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> At page 19, question 16 you were asked</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line915"><a name="pos915"></a>"Who between Mr Bhekinkosi Mkhize and Mr Damarra Chonco was commander in chief of the attackers on 17 June 1992 in Boipatong"?</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line916"><a name="pos916"></a>Your answer, page 28, paragraph 16:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line917"><a name="pos917"></a>"Both of them were the commanders of the Boipatong attack on the 17th of June 1992"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line918"><a name="pos918"></a>Do you have any explanation for that Mr Mthembu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line919"><a name="pos919"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> As I have explained here that Mr Chonco was the person in charge and I also indicated that Mkhize was also present at the stadium just before we left on the attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line920"><a name="pos920"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> At the stadium, did Mr Chonco address you or address the people who had gathered there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line921"><a name="pos921"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line922"><a name="pos922"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mkhize, did he address them as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line923"><a name="pos923"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I don't remember Sir, whether he addressed us or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line924"><a name="pos924"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, I'm no moving onto another section, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line925"><a name="pos925"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We intend rising at one thirty, so perhaps closer to the time you will indicate when it is appropriate for you to do so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line926"><a name="pos926"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I will.</p>
<p class="line" id="line927"><a name="pos927"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, very well, thanks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line928"><a name="pos928"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Mthembu, I want you now to try an be as specific as you can.  You've said that at some point a decision was taken to attack the Vaal community, we're now talking a number of townships, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line929"><a name="pos929"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line930"><a name="pos930"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You don't know when that decision was taken, can you tell the Committee how many months before the attack on Boipatong was that decision taken?</p>
<p class="line" id="line931"><a name="pos931"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I do not have knowledge about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line932"><a name="pos932"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You cannot say whether it was two weeks before the attack or two months or two years before the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line933"><a name="pos933"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I would not have knowledge about that Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line934"><a name="pos934"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Why was the decision taken?  And please try and be very careful in your answer, why was the decision taken to attack the townships of the Vaal if I can put it that way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line935"><a name="pos935"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> As far as I know it was because there were many people from our organisation who had been burnt in the townships.  There had been several incidents of this nature.  Even in the town people would be abducted and burnt.  I think that was the reason why people were eventually attacked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line936"><a name="pos936"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Mthembu, that's why I ask you please to concentrate on my questions.  I'm asking you why the decision was taken to attack the townships of the Vaal, not the decision to attack Boipatong.  Do you see the difference?</p>
<p class="line" id="line937"><a name="pos937"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> As I'm explaining it to you Sir, as far as I know I think it was taken because there were some of our people who were being burnt down in the townships.</p>
<p class="line" id="line938"><a name="pos938"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Now when did that start, the killing of IFP members in the townships?</p>
<p class="line" id="line939"><a name="pos939"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> As far as I know we started suffering in July 1990, after we had held a meeting in a stadium in Zone 7.  From then onwards we started encountering problems, like people going to work would be abducted and be burnt in the township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line940"><a name="pos940"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You say: "in the township", which township are you referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line941"><a name="pos941"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I am talking of townships such as Sharpeville.</p>
<p class="line" id="line942"><a name="pos942"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And which others?</p>
<p class="line" id="line943"><a name="pos943"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I'm sorry, the meeting that you're referring to which was held at Zone 7, is that right? Was that in Sebokeng?</p>
<p class="line" id="line944"><a name="pos944"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line945"><a name="pos945"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Alright.  Was that the meeting of the IFP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line946"><a name="pos946"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, Sir, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line947"><a name="pos947"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was that the first meeting of the IFP in Sebokeng?</p>
<p class="line" id="line948"><a name="pos948"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> As far as I know it was the first meeting in Sebokeng.</p>
<p class="line" id="line949"><a name="pos949"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line950"><a name="pos950"></a>	These attacks that you are talking about are attacks that took place in Sharpeville?</p>
<p class="line" id="line951"><a name="pos951"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> What I'm explaining Sir is that that is one of the areas of which I heard that our people were being terrorised but our people were also being terrorised in other townships in the Vaal Triangle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line952"><a name="pos952"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well, let's be more specific then, when was the decision taken to attack Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line953"><a name="pos953"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> As far as I know there were people in the Boipatong township who had families there and on their way to their homes they would be abducted and necklaced such as a Mr Gazu that I can still remember and another boy, Mbatha boy, who had also been killed in Boipatong.  It then came to a point where it was discussed that these attacks were now continuing on our people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line954"><a name="pos954"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think the question that you're being asked is this: when was the decision to attack Boipatong taken and the date if you know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line955"><a name="pos955"></a>	That is your question, is that right Mr Berger?</p>
<p class="line" id="line956"><a name="pos956"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes, yes indeed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line957"><a name="pos957"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I would not have knowledge Sir, on when the decision was taken.</p>
<p class="line" id="line958"><a name="pos958"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> When did you become aware of the decision to attack Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line959"><a name="pos959"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I knew about it when I had already arrived at the stadium.</p>
<p class="line" id="line960"><a name="pos960"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> This was on the night of the 17th of June?</p>
<p class="line" id="line961"><a name="pos961"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> That is correct Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line962"><a name="pos962"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Now the people who were killed in Boipatong, if I understand you correctly Boipatong was selected as a target for attack because members of the IFP had been killed in Boipatong, is that your evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line963"><a name="pos963"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line964"><a name="pos964"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The people who you say were killed in Boipatong are one, Gazu ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line965"><a name="pos965"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> ...[no English translation]</p>
<p class="line" id="line966"><a name="pos966"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Gazwe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line967"><a name="pos967"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Gazu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line968"><a name="pos968"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Gazu.  And am I correct, you mentioned Mbatha?</p>
<p class="line" id="line969"><a name="pos969"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, one of them was a boy from the Mbatha family in Mashlabateni.</p>
<p class="line" id="line970"><a name="pos970"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Anybody else that you say was killed in Boipatong or are these two the only two?</p>
<p class="line" id="line971"><a name="pos971"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I'm only naming those that I know or those that I remember.  I cannot mention others because I do not know them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line972"><a name="pos972"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you do not know of them either, you do not know of any other killings other than Gazu and Mbatha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line973"><a name="pos973"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No, I do not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line974"><a name="pos974"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well the question is, apart from Gazu and Mbatha, were there any other IFP persons who were killed in Boipatong but whose particulars you don't know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line975"><a name="pos975"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I am trying to explain that there were others that were killed but whose or details I do not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line976"><a name="pos976"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Do you know when Gazu was killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line977"><a name="pos977"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Although I may not remember but it was before the attack on Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line978"><a name="pos978"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> How long before the attack, one week, one month, one year?</p>
<p class="line" id="line979"><a name="pos979"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is there an issue as to whether Gazu or Mbatha were killed in Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line980"><a name="pos980"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Indeed yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line981"><a name="pos981"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is the evidence that there were no such deaths, these individuals were not killed in Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line982"><a name="pos982"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well Chairperson, the first time that we've had any particularity on who was killed is now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line983"><a name="pos983"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, but I just want to find out, is it an issue that these two individuals were killed in Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line984"><a name="pos984"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes, yes it is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line985"><a name="pos985"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is the issue, is it that they were not killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line986"><a name="pos986"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well Chairperson, I have consulted on this specific issue ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line987"><a name="pos987"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I know that but I want to know so that we can give the witness the opportunity to know what is it that is an issue about this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line988"><a name="pos988"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, on the basis of the instructions that I have so far these two names are not mentioned.  I cannot now say as a matter of fact I'm disputing it, I'll have to take instructions on that but on the instructions that I have thusfar there is no Gazu and there is no Mbatha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line989"><a name="pos989"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We're not here to decide whether or not Mbatha was killed or Gazu in Boipatong.  We're here about whether or not these individuals are entitled to amnesty in regard to the killings in Boipatong.  This is why I'm trying to limit the scope of the inquiry.  If you have the information which differs from what the witness says, please put it to him so that he can have the opportunity.  I understand that on the instructions you have, these two names do not appear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line990"><a name="pos990"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line991"><a name="pos991"></a>	Mr Mthembu, on the instructions I have up to this point there is no Gazu and no Mbatha who were killed in Boipatong, are you adamant that those two were killed in Boipatong before the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line992"><a name="pos992"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, I am certain that these people were killed in Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line993"><a name="pos993"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I now want to read to you from certain confessions which were made at the time of the massacre.  This is a confession which was made by Bhekinkosi Mkhize.</p>
<p class="line" id="line994"><a name="pos994"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> May I intervene at this stage Chairperson.  It's my instructions that that confession is not an admissible confession in terms of the Constitution and in terms of the Criminal Procedure Act.  In fact the State prosecutor during the trial elected not to use those confessions on - well I can't say on that basis, but we opposed the admissibility of those confessions and we still maintain that those confessions are inadmissible evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line995"><a name="pos995"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, this very issued was argued at the Amnesty Hearings into the death of Mr Chris Hani and it was ruled then that any confessions, any statement that has been made can be used for the purposes of cross-examination in an Amnesty Hearing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line996"><a name="pos996"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That issue is before this Committee, not then.  We want to hear argument now as to why you say it is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line997"><a name="pos997"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well there is a statement here, on the face of it it was made freely and voluntarily.  There is nothing in this document to suggest that it's not a document signed by Mr Nkosi, Mr Mkhize, I beg your pardon.  The purpose of these inquiries I would submit is to get to the truth, to ensure that there is full disclosure and here is a document which I submit is highly relevant to the issues that this Committee has to decide.</p>
<p class="line" id="line998"><a name="pos998"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What's the position of Mr Mkhize in regard to this document?</p>
<p class="line" id="line999"><a name="pos999"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> I must take specific instructions in this regard.  I can just rely on my memory.  My instructions previously were that that confession was not freely and voluntarily made.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1000"><a name="pos1000"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well shouldn't you take instruction from your client and let us know what the basis is upon which this is being, we can sit here and you can just take those instructions now.  Will you be able to do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1001"><a name="pos1001"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> I can do it but I firstly haven't go the confession at hand so I'll have to get it.  I haven't got it in my possession right now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1002"><a name="pos1002"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1003"><a name="pos1003"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> It makes it a bit difficult.  I see it's twenty six minutes past already and as the Chairman indicated to take the adjournment at half past, so with the leave of the Chairman I would do it over the weekend.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1004"><a name="pos1004"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay.  We will leave aside for the moment the question of the confession and then would you go on with other ...[inaudible]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1005"><a name="pos1005"></a>END OF TAPE - POSSIBLE WORDS LOST</p>
<p class="line" id="line1006"><a name="pos1006"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...[inaudible] and come and tell us the basis if any upon which there is an objection to the use of the statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1007"><a name="pos1007"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I shall Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1008"><a name="pos1008"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1009"><a name="pos1009"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, I would then like to refer the witness to another confession not made by any of the applicants.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1010"><a name="pos1010"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Would you refer to others matters other than the confession.  Do you have other questions on other matters not on confessions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1011"><a name="pos1011"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I do Chairperson.  It's twenty seven minutes past one ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1012"><a name="pos1012"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay.  Perhaps, why don't you refer to those other matters and then the question of the confession will then be argued first thing on Monday and then we can go on with issues relating to the confessions.  That confession, does it relate to one of the persons who are applicants here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1013"><a name="pos1013"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> No, it's not, it's not a confession by an applicant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1014"><a name="pos1014"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well I think it would be proper to deal with the question of confessions thereafter.  Perhaps you should continue with other questions which are not related to the confessions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1015"><a name="pos1015"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, even if this document on the face of it, is freely and voluntarily made.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1016"><a name="pos1016"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> All confessions are.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1017"><a name="pos1017"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> All confessions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1018"><a name="pos1018"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Berger?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1019"><a name="pos1019"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I'm back on track.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1020"><a name="pos1020"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, very well.  I just want to mention one point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1021"><a name="pos1021"></a>	Mr Strydom, once you've taken instructions from your client, as soon as possible would you indicate to Mr Berger the basis upon which there will be any objection if any?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1022"><a name="pos1022"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> I will do so Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1023"><a name="pos1023"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So that he can prepare himself accordingly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1024"><a name="pos1024"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1025"><a name="pos1025"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Thank you Chairperson.  I will have to leave that whole section that I was cross-examining on because the confessions fall into something else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1026"><a name="pos1026"></a>	I will move now Mr Mthembu to the question of SADF involvement in the attack.  You've told the Committee about the presence of SAP vehicles, you remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1027"><a name="pos1027"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, I remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1028"><a name="pos1028"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you said that as you were going past the vehicles you saw the police, they must have seen you, they did nothing to stop you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1029"><a name="pos1029"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1030"><a name="pos1030"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> That was during the attack, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1031"><a name="pos1031"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> It was after the attack as we were returning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1032"><a name="pos1032"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I will come to the police in a moment, let's deal with the SADF.  Are you saying that there was no SADF involvement in the attack at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1033"><a name="pos1033"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> A broad question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1034"><a name="pos1034"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Alright, I'll ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1035"><a name="pos1035"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Perhaps you should - yes, please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1036"><a name="pos1036"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Alright.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1037"><a name="pos1037"></a>	Was the army present either before, during or after the attack on Boipatong that night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1038"><a name="pos1038"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> As I've explained, when we left Boipatong as we were about to cross the road near the garage, that is where I became aware that there were soldiers standing around there, some near the robots.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1039"><a name="pos1039"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> This is now as you're leaving Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1040"><a name="pos1040"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1041"><a name="pos1041"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you leave through Umzumgogo Street, is that the street you left on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1042"><a name="pos1042"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I think we left through the ...[indistinct] National Board.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1043"><a name="pos1043"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> ...[inaudible] next to those factories that you saw the soldiers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1044"><a name="pos1044"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> It was not close by but there is a garage near the robots where I saw army vehicles parked there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1045"><a name="pos1045"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...[inaudible]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1046"><a name="pos1046"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No, I do not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1047"><a name="pos1047"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You mentioned that you also saw the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1048"><a name="pos1048"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1049"><a name="pos1049"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...[inaudible] to the army, where were the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1050"><a name="pos1050"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> As I've explained, army vehicles and SAP vehicles, I saw both these vehicles, they were all parked near these factories near the garage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1051"><a name="pos1051"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1052"><a name="pos1052"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So the police and the army were parked together?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1053"><a name="pos1053"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, that's how I would put it, it was in one area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1054"><a name="pos1054"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What do you say about an allegation that one of your comrades shot at an army vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1055"><a name="pos1055"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That is during the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1056"><a name="pos1056"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> During the attack yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1057"><a name="pos1057"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1058"><a name="pos1058"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I have no knowledge about that Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1059"><a name="pos1059"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You saw no army vehicle inside Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1060"><a name="pos1060"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No, I did not see any inside Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1061"><a name="pos1061"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you see any police vehicles inside Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1062"><a name="pos1062"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1063"><a name="pos1063"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you see any policemen inside Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1064"><a name="pos1064"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No, I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1065"><a name="pos1065"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you see any whites inside Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1066"><a name="pos1066"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No, I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1067"><a name="pos1067"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I take it you didn't see any white policemen inside Boipatong either?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1068"><a name="pos1068"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No, I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1069"><a name="pos1069"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> During your criminal trial, it was part the defence case, your case, that there were members of the South African Police and in particular white members of the South African Police involved in the attack, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1070"><a name="pos1070"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I have no knowledge of that Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1071"><a name="pos1071"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> But it was part - let me read to you from page 3724, from the Judgment of the Court.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1072"><a name="pos1072"></a>	It's at page 276 of the bundle Chairperson, line 11:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1073"><a name="pos1073"></a>"Soos reeds van tevore gemeld, ontken die beskuldigdes dat hulle enige aandeel gehad het in die aanval op Boipatong gedurende die aan van 17de Junie 1992.  Uit hoofde van hulle verweer beweer die beskuldigdes dat hulle nie in staat is om te vermeld wie verantwoordelik was vir of meegedoen het aan die aanval nie maar vermeld hulle tog dat daar na die aanval gerigte was dat die Suid Afrikaanse Polisie en meer in besonder blanke lede van die Suid Afrikaanse Polisie betrokke was.  Die Staatsgetuies is met bewerings van ooggetuies wat polisie betrokkenheid tydens die sitting van die Goldstone Kommissie beweer het gekonfronteer en tydens die verdedigingssaak is twee getuies, ene Selo en ene Mabuza geroep om polisie betrokkenheid te bewys"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1074"><a name="pos1074"></a>Now my question to you is, first of all do you confirm that it was part of your case in the criminal trial that there was police involvement and in particular the involvement of white policemen during the attack, that that was your case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1075"><a name="pos1075"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> As I have explained Sir, I do not have knowledge about the presence of the police.  I did indicate that I did not see policemen inside the township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1076"><a name="pos1076"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Do you confirm that it was part of your case that there was such police involvement and in particular involvement by white policemen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1077"><a name="pos1077"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I am saying I have no knowledge about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1078"><a name="pos1078"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Just explain to the witness.  You know to us lawyers it's easy to know what it means: "it was part of your case" but to a lay person it's not very apparent what that means.  If you could just explain what you mean by that then he'd be able to give you a direct answer I think.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1079"><a name="pos1079"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, and also in regard to what is meant by: "involvement".  Involvement in the sense that the police were there but you know, but they just stood there without taking any action or whether they were also amongst the people who were attacking.  I think that's what would maybe help.  Bearing in mind that when you tell us we will rise.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1080"><a name="pos1080"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, I'm quite happy to tell Mr Mthembu what I mean and I'll do that now but as far as the actual involvement of the police, I would have to check the record on that and so I will ask that I do that on Monday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1081"><a name="pos1081"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think the proper thing to do probably is for you to get a sense, to go back to the record and find out what was that degree of involvement that was mentioned so that you can put that to the witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1082"><a name="pos1082"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What was put on behalf of the defence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1083"><a name="pos1083"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, indeed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1084"><a name="pos1084"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I will do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1085"><a name="pos1085"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, I think so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1086"><a name="pos1086"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1087"><a name="pos1087"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Have you run out of questions now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1088"><a name="pos1088"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> No, Chairperson, I haven't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1089"><a name="pos1089"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So far?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1090"><a name="pos1090"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> But I think this would be an appropriate point to take the adjournment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1091"><a name="pos1091"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, very well, so that you canvass this other matter.  We're thinking of 9 o'clock on Monday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1092"><a name="pos1092"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> To start?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1093"><a name="pos1093"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> To start.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1094"><a name="pos1094"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes, yes, that's alright.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1095"><a name="pos1095"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> 9 o'clock yes.  Mr Brink, 9 o'clock on Monday"</p>
<p class="line" id="line1096"><a name="pos1096"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> I'm very happy with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1097"><a name="pos1097"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, very well.  At this stage these proceedings are then adjourned until Monday at 9 o'clock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1098"><a name="pos1098"></a>	Thank you Mr Mthembu.  I just want to remind you that you're still under oath and you are not required to discuss this case with anyone else whilst you're still under oath, do you understand that?  Very well.</p>
