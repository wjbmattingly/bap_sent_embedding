<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a>	Mr Berger, I understand that the team is expanding.  Would you for the record just place Mr Malindi on record?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Thank you Chairperson.  As from today, Advocate P G Malindi: M-A-L-I-N-D-I will be assisting in the representation of the victims.  As soon as we have finalised the list of which victims are represented by Advocate Malindi, Ms Cambanis and me, we will hand those lists up to the Committee so that we can have finality on who is being represented by whom.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You do confirm that Mr Malindi do you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> I do confirm that Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, very well, welcome to the proceedings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a>	Mr Mthembu, may I remind you that you are still under oath.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">VICTOR MTHANDENI MTHEMBU:</span> (s.u.o.)</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The one matter that was outstanding as from Friday was the issue of whether or not Mr Berger can make use of a confession in cross-examining the applicant, Mr Mthembu.  Mr Strydom was going to indicate to us this morning the basis of his objections to that line of cross-examination.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a>	Mr Strydom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Mr Chairperson, Mr Berger indicated to me that he only wanted to use the one confession of Mr Mkhize and I have had insight of the confession and apart from stating that that confession was made not freely and voluntarily but under duress, on behalf of the applicants we will have no objection is that document is used during cross-examination.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Berger, do you accept that offer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, there are two points I wish to make.  The first is that I informed Mr Strydom on Friday that Mr Mkhize's confession was the only confession from amongst the applicants that I had in my possession at the moment that I intend using but that I do have other confessions of people who are non-applicants whose I intend using.  In fact I think I made that clear during the proceedings as well on Friday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a>	The second point is Chairperson, that after I showed Mr Strydom the confession on Friday after we had adjourned, he read through it and I asked him what his position was and he informed me that he was objecting to my use of that confession.  I'm somewhat taken aback by his attitude considering that I spent time having to research this point and I would have appreciated it if I could have been notified in advance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I suppose you should be thankful of the fact that he has reflected on the matter properly and he has withdrawn his objection to the matter.  In regard to the other confessions perhaps we will follow the same procedure and that is make them available to your colleagues but I think whilst one doesn't want to curtail the cross-examination of the applicant and the use of any document that might be relevant for the purposes of cross-examination, I think one also has to reflect on what would be the fact of putting a confession by somebody else on these applicants and what would be the value of that evidence if any.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think one has to bear that in mind in the interest of shortening the time and not burdening these proceedings with undue documents which in the end may or may not give any assistance in arriving at the decision which we have to reach.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a>	Mr Berger, you may proceed Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Mr Chairperson, before we proceed, may I just suggest that before these confessions are used, whether we may have insight into them as well the statement of the witnesses that Mr Mthembu was cross-examined on Friday and who were nameless witnesses.  We do not have copies of those statements and I would like to ask Mr Berger if he can give us copies of those statements.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I have prepared copies for my learned friends and for the Committee.  Perhaps this would be an appropriate point to hand them up.  The first document is a copy from Mr Mthembu's identity document.  You will recall Mr Mthembu said he had a licence for two guns, this copy shows that he has a licence for three guns.  If I may hand them in.  	Chairperson, I believe the last exhibit was Exhibit B so this would become Exhibit C.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a>	Another document which will then be marked Exhibit D is the confidential memorandum from which I got the information that someone had deposed to an affidavit concerning hitsquads that were operating from the Kwamadala Hostel.  If I could hand that up.  It will be Exhibit D, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Then as far as the confessions are concerned, Chairperson my submission is that ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> As far as what exhibit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> It's not an exhibit yet, the confessions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Oh, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> My submission is that it's a question of principle or it's a question of law whether or not these confessions are admissible in these proceedings and that it doesn't depend on the contents of the confessions, so I'm quite happy to hand in the confessions when I put them to the witness but I would be loathe, unless the Committee directs me to do so, to hand over all the confessions now because that would take away some of the advantages of cross-examination.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think what everyone who is involved in these proceedings must realise is that the purpose of these hearings is to get to the truth as far as that is practical.  It is highly undesirable that this should be turned into either a criminal trial or a civil proceeding.  We will not as a Committee countenance any attempt to convert this inquiry into those proceedings because we do not believe that it is in the interest of everyone involved here that that should happen.  If there are documents that will be used, those documents must as far as is possible be made available to all the legal representatives so that they can prepare.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I will then do so Chairperson.  If I can then, there are four confessions that I intend referring to and if I could hand them in as Exhibits E, F, G and H.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think Mr Berger, you can only hand in these confessions as and when you come to deal with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> That's what I wanted to do Chairperson, yes, I perhaps misunderstood you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, no, I'm only referring in regard to making those available to your colleagues not to the Committee.  The Committee can have sight of those as and when you deal with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well I'm going to deal with all of them now so perhaps it would be convenient for me to hand them in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well if there's one that you wanted to deal with on Friday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Hand that one in, let's deal with that one first and then once you've finished that one we can then go onto the next one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, the next exhibit will then be Exhibit E and that is the confession of Mr Bhekinkosi Mkhize.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If I may know, how many of these confessions do you intend referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Four Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, very well.  Is there a way the contents of these confessions can be put to the witness so that we don't have to go tediously through each and every confession or to they not lend themselves to that procedure?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, as far as possible I will attempt to summarise what the confessions say but the whole point of the confessions is that they do say different things and that's what I want to canvass with Mr Mthembu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What I want to avoid is having to repeat what each and every confession is saying</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> No, I won't be doing that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR BERGER:</span> (Continues)  If I can then continue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a>	Mr Mthembu, on Friday we were dealing with the reason that you gave for attacking Boipatong and one of the things that you said was that two people had been killed in Boipatong and you mentioned a person by the name of Gazu and a person by the name of Mbatha.  Now I'm putting to you that no person by the name of Gazu and no person by the name of Mbatha was killed in Boipatong before the attack.  Do you have any comment on that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Mr Berger, I am only talking about what I know.  The two people I mentioned on Friday are people I know that are deceased and were killed in Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You cannot tell the Committee when they were killed can you?  You cannot even put a year to it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I cannot remember quite clearly which year it was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Now if you would look at page 29 of the bundle, paragraph 17.4, you give the reasons for attacking Boipatong.  I see you've been reading paragraph 17.4, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The first reason you say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a>"They also threatened the residents of the Kwamadala Hostel"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a>Who is the: "they"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> The residents of Boipatong, because they did not allow us to come into the township even to buy from the shops.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Were you ever threatened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> At the time of the attack, is it correct that there were IFP supporters living in Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I would not know that Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You had family staying in Boipatong, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You had friends staying in Boipatong, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No, I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well have a look them please at page 41 of your bundle, paragraph 15.  In the middle of that paragraph you say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a>"We realised that we partook in the massacre of people, some of whom were my family and friends and I feel very bad about this"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a>From your own hand we see that you had family and friends living in Boipatong who were killed during the attack, isn't that what you say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> What I was explaining here was about the people with whom I had once been romantically involved who were staying in Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I don't understand your answer Mr Mthembu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Here Sir I was speaking about my ex-girlfriend.  I don't know whether it is understandable.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Your ex-girlfriend's family was killed in that attack, is that what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Although I would not know but I think they were injured.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What was their name?  Let's start with the name of your ex-girlfriend.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Katiwe Dlamini.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And the members of her family who were injured or killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I would not know Sir what eventually happened to them because at that stage I could not communicate with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well, can you then give us the names of her family who she was staying with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I will not give you these names because I've only concerned with the girl I was in love with but I did not know about her parents or the members of her family.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Where did she live in Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> In the streets opposite the shops in Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What street was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I don't know its name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> When did you start visiting her in Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Around 1991.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And when did you stop visiting here in Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I don't remember when I stopped visiting her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> How long was she your girlfriend?</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Please repeat your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> How long was she your girlfriend?</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Because of the fact that we never broke up I think she is still my girlfriend but we cannot see each other anymore and I don't know where she is now and she also doesn't know where I am now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You see because you told the Committee last week that you had never been into Boipatong until the night of the massacre.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I did not say that, you never asked me a question about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So the family and friends that you are referring to in this paragraph are the family of your girlfriend, Katiwe Dlamini?</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> This whole paragraph was supposed to explain about the family members or rather members of the family who were victimised or traumatised by the Boipatong incident as a whole.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> No, Mr Mthembu, that's not what you say here at all.  You say here very clearly that some of the people</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a>"We realised that we partook in the massacre of people, some of whom were my family and friends"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a>In other words some of the people who were massacred were your family and friends and you feel very bad about that and that's what you're saying sorry for, isn't that what you're saying here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Please try to understand that I was not only referring to the person I was in love with or the family members thereof but I was speaking generally about the attack on the people of Boipatong and I feel badly that people were killed and I ask for forgiveness for everything that happened, from the family members of the people who were victimised.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Because some of them who were killed were your family and your friends, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> All in all I was speaking of everybody who was traumatised or victimised, not necessarily friends or family members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Why is it that you don't want to conceded Mr Mthembu, that at the time of the massacre there were IFP supporters still living in Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> As far as I know I do not have knowledge of that.  What I know is that prior to the attack many IFP members had left the township because they were being terrorised there and they fled to Kwamadala Hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Isn't it correct that the people who had been chased out of the township were people who had been accused by the community of being criminals who stole, who raped, who stabbed and who killed people?  Isn't that why they were chased out of the township?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I do not have knowledge of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> People who were terrorising the community as I've described, those are the people who were chased out of the township, isn't that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I don't know anything about that Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Alright.  Let me refer you then to the confession of one of your co-applicants, Mr Bhekinkosi Mkhize.  This is the man who you say took the decision or one of the people who took the decision to attack Boipatong, do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> If you look at his confession which he made on the 11th of July 1992 very shortly after the massacre, if you'll turn to page four you'll see there he describes what happened on the night of the 17th and if you look in the middle of the page ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Mr Chairperson, I don't think he has ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> I just noticed he didn't have a copy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Oh, Mr Mthembu doesn't have a copy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> I don't have a copy either Mr Chairperson.  I'm sorry, I think she is making some for us at this stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mthembu, can you read Afrikaans?</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a>	This statement is in Afrikaans, right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> It is yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can you read Afrikaans?</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No, I cannot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Advocate Pretorius?</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> I have a copy now from my learned friend, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I'll then translate for you.  Mr Mkhize says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a>"I was at my room at the Kwamadala Hostel.  I liver there in room 8.  That Wednesday at that time I was at the stadium inside the hostel.  I and other people at that hostel decided that the people are preventing us from going outside of the hostel to the shops.  We then decided to attack the people who lived in the vicinity of the hostel"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a>The point is he makes no mention whatsoever of the attack being in retaliation for IFP members who had been killed.  Do you have any comment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Does he state anywhere in this affidavit how he'd been prevented from going out of the hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, he just states exactly what I've just read, that's all he states about the reason for the attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do we know how then they were prevented?  Were they prevented by being told: "Don't go out of your hostel" or were they being prevented by killed if they're out or if they've been prevented by being harassed?  I mean do you we know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> We don't know Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So do you think therefore it's fair to put to the witness that he doesn't say so, in view of the fact that the confession you've just read doesn't indicate, all it says they were preventing people from going out of the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well, I'll ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think the best for you, you could simply say that the confession does not make mention of any persons who were killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> That's what I said Chairperson.  I said to Mr Mthembu, the point of this is that Mr Mkhize doesn't make any mention of anybody being killed and I asked Mr Mthembu to comment on that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a>	Mr Mthembu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In fact a retaliation.  In your question you referred to retaliation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes, he doesn't make any mention ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What you put to this witness is that Mkhize makes no mention that the attack was in retaliation of the people who had been killed in Boipatong, of preventing them from going ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Shall I leave out the word: "retaliation"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I'm saying that it's a bit unfair because from you've put to the witness by way of, from this confession is that people were being prevented.  There is no indication from this confession as to how that occurred.  Did it occur by way of killing people, harassing them, one doesn't know.  That is why I'm saying that it may well be that that's what it was, they were prevented by being killed but one doesn't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, the point that I really wanted Mr Mthembu to comment on was that one would have expected Mr Mkhize, if IFP members were being killed and that that was the reason for the attack, one would have expected Mr Mkhize to say so in a confession which ultimately would have been something exculpatory.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Precisely, that's what you should put to the witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Mthembu, do you understand my question or would you like me to rephrase it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I understand you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And what is your comment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> What I will comment on is that as I listened to you while reading the statement it becomes obvious that people were harassed when they went out to buy in the shops in Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a>	Even though he doesn't mention it here I think he knows that the people I've mentioned as being killed in Boipatong were indeed killed because he was also present at their funerals. </p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a>	People would move from the hostel to the township and that's where they would be harassed and even killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think what Mr Berger wants to emphasise is that if the attack on Boipatong was indeed in retaliation of the people who had been killed in Boipatong given the fact that this was a confession dealing precisely with what the attack on Boipatong, one would have expected Mr Mkhize to have said so in so many words in this confession, namely that: "We went to attack them because they had killed".  Do you understand the point that Mr Berger is emphasising?</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, I understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you know Mkhize did that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I would not know why he did not include that in his statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Do you know of any other reason why Mr Mkhize agreed to attack Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I think Sir, it was because people had been dying for a very long time, people who had been killed by the comrades in Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Wasn't it because Mr Mkhize was the sole proprietor of beer inside the hostel and his supply of beer was cut off?</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> That doesn't mean that the comrades for example were now harassing the bottle store owner from whom Mkhize was getting his supplies, threatening to kill him if he continued the supplies.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And was that the reason for the attack, because Mr Mkhize's beer supply was being cut off by the comrades?</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Even though I may not say whether that is the reason or not but the main reason is that our people were being killed in Boipatong.  I think that is the reason why a decision was taken because people realised that people were being killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You were asked at page 19, question 17.3</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a>"When was it decided to attack Boipatong"?</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a>Your answer appears at page 29, paragraph 17.3.  In response to the question of when it was decided you say:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a>"Mr Vanana Zulu was staying at Boipatong and the comrades chased him away and burnt his house at Majola Section in Boipatong.  This they did after they had discovered that Vanana Zulu was a member of the IFP"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a>That's the first point that you give, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> When was Mr Vanana Zulu's house burnt?</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Even though I cannot remember but it was burnt before the attack on Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> How many months before the attack on Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I have no knowledge of that Sir, it's been long now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well was it a week before the attack on Boipatong, a month before the attack on Boipatong, a few months before the attack on Boipatong?  Can you give the Committee some idea of the time that had lapsed between the burning of Mr Vanana Zulu's house and the attack on Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> As I have explained Sir, I am not in the position, it is difficult for me to remember how long it took before the attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> It wasn't a week before the attack was it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I think Sir, you understand what I am saying here when I am saying that I cannot remember how long it really took before the attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> How do you know that Mr Vanana Zulu's house was in Majola Section?</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> He was living with us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And he told you that his house was in Majola Section?</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you knew that before the attack on Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did all the attackers know that, that Mr Vanana Zulu's house was in Majola Section, would you know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I don't know, I cannot answer on their behalf.</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You go and you say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a>"Mr Mkhize"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a>This is now the second point of this paragraph:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a>"was the sole proprietor of beer inside the hostel.  The comrades discovered that one of the Boipatong Bottle Store owners sold Mr Mkhize some beer and then threatened to kill the owner.  Mr Mkhize became angry and agreed with Mr Chonco to attack the residents of Boipatong"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a>So in response to the question of: "When was it decided to attack the residents of Boipatong", you identified two events, the one is the burning of Vanana Zulu's house and the second is when Mr Mkhize became angry because is supply of beer was threatened with being cut off.  Those are the two events which prompted the attack on Boipatong, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> These are some of the reasons and also as I have explained earlier on, people were being harassed in Boipatong, they were being killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You see because what I want to put to you is that this reason of Mr Mkhize's that you articulate in this paragraph is clearly a personal reason of his for wanting to attack Boipatong, would you agree with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I do not agree with that and I would not disagree with that either because it doesn't directly concern me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Let me then refer you to another confession, it's a confession of Philip Mpena.  Do you know a person Philip Mpena?</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No, I have no knowledge of him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, perhaps it could be marked F.  Can I hand out while I'm going because it will just go a lot quicker.   Exhibit G would be the confession of Musa Dlamini and then Exhibit H would be the confession of Njanelwa Ndaba.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Mr Berger, we need a copy for the witness if you're going to refer him to it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> They're all in Afrikaans so it won't assist.</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Okay.  At least then maybe the interpreters could have a copy so they can see it and pass it on as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Mr Chairman, may I also have one please, I haven't got one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> And I haven't got one either Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Mthembu, before we get onto those confessions, do you know anything about the attack on the home of Mr Ernest Tsotso?</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Do you know Mr Ernest Tsotso is?</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I just know the name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Do you know anything about the man?</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I just heard that he is one of the people who was in charge of the comrades in Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> He was a senior ANC leader in Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, I heard so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> In July 1991 you were in Kwamadala Hostel, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> At that time you were the Vice-Chairperson of the IFP Youth Brigade, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> That's correct Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you don't know anything about the fact that on the 3rd of July 1991, Mr Tsotso's house was attacked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Attacked by IFP members, you don't know about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No, Sir, I don't know of it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And at the time Mr Tsotso was attending an ANC conference in Durban and his entire family was wiped out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I have no knowledge of that Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Do you know that Mr Vanana Zulu left Boipatong before that attack on Mr Tsotso's family?  In other words he left Boipatong before July 1991.</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I have no knowledge of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You see my point is, when you were asked the question: "When was it decided to attack Boipatong"?, you pointed to two events as being the trigger for the attack on Boipatong.  The one was the burning of Mr Vanana Zulu's house which occurred before July 1991.</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, you said before July 1991 and you're saying here that - sorry, I beg your pardon ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> No, no, the one is the attack on the Tsotso family, the other is the burning of ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> I beg your pardon, I got confused there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Vanana Zulu's house was burnt before July 1991.</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I hear, I understand that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The attack on Boipatong came a year later.</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> That's correct Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So that couldn't have been the event that triggered the attack on Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I have given you reasons which I know to have led to attack the people at Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> In Exhibit F, this is the confession of Philip Mpena, he gives an explanation about what happened on the night of the 17th of June 1992.  He says that you were called to the stadium, he was called to the stadium and then he says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a>"'n Sekere ou in kom met die van van Mkhize het gese dat ons Boipatong moet gaan aanval"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a>He's saying there: </p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a>"A man the name of Mkhize came in and he said we must attack Boipatong.  We then went to Boipatong and we killed people there"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a>Again the point I'm making to you is that nowhere in this confession is there mention of the fact that: "we went to attack Boipatong because our people were being killed".  And again I'm suggesting to you that if that were the reason and if someone was making a confession one would have expected him to say: "Yes, I confess I went to kill the people but I went to kill the people because my people were being killed".  It doesn't say that.  Do you have an explanation for that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Sir, that statement was signed by Mpena himself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You can't explain it, that's what you're saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Exactly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I can just tell you again, in the next confession, Exhibit G of Muso Tokozani Dlamini, again he gives an explanation about the attack, again no mention of the attack, of IFP supporters being killed and that's why there was an attack.  Silent on that aspect.  Can you comment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Then I want to refer you to Exhibit H, the affidavit of Mr Njanelwa Ndaba.  In paragraph 7 of that affidavit he gives a very interesting explanation for why the people of Boipatong were attacked.  He says the following at paragraph 7 and I will translate.  He says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a>"The reasons which were given to me why Boipatong was attacked by the residents of Kwamadala Hostel on the 17th of June 1992 and killed is as follows"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a>And he talks about two people who told him - I'll summarise this for you, about the residents of Boipatong being protected by people from Sharpeville but he says that in return for this protection these people from Sharpeville demanded money from the people of Boipatong.  And then I'll read to you what he says in the last paragraph.  He says:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a>"What I'm actually saying is that from conversations with people who live in Boipatong and who work at Iscor, also from conversations with residents of the Kwamadala Hostel who work at Iscor and in other places, the reason for the attack on the residents of Boipatong is as a result of the people who were protecting"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a>The Afrikaans word is: "bewaak", I think that that does mean to protect.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a>"people who were guarding Boipatong"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a>And maybe I should read the Afrikaans so that I don't misquote.  He says:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a>"Is die rede vir die aanval of die inwoners van Boipatong as gevolg van die persone wat Boipatong"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a>He uses the word:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a>"Sirela"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a>for Boipatong.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a>"bewaak het en hulle gedurig voorgekeer het en geld vir hulle dienste geeis het"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a>He goes on, he says:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a>"Verder dat die persone wat Sirela, Boipatong, die nag van 17 Junie 1992 aangeval en gedood het soos reeds vermeld inwoners van die Kwamadala Hostel is en kon hulle blykbaar nie die sogenaamde bewakers van Sirela, Boipatong opspoor nie en het hulle toe besluit om nie met lee hande terugtekeer nie, met ander woorde gaan om mense aanteval en dan niks doen nie.  Hulle het toe besluit om maar in Sirela, Boipatong integaan en wraak op ander inwoners te neem"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a>So he says that the residents of Kwamadala went out to attack the guards from Sharpeville and when they couldn't find them, instead of coming back with empty hands then they decided to exact revenge on the other residents of Boipatong.  Was that the reason for the attack Mr Mthembu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Mr Berger, as I have explained to you earlier on I am still maintaining that people were attacked because they were harassing our people.  What you are reading from that statement, even though I do not know whose statement it is, but that's how perhaps that person sees it and I therefore cannot say something about something that I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Does that statement indicate what that revenge was for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> No, Chairperson, it just talks about: "wraak" but what the statement does indicate is that the attack was for one purpose and then when that purpose couldn't be achieved then it was decided well let's exact revenge on the people of Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It doesn't say revenge for what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> It doesn't say revenge for what.</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Mthembu, I'm putting to you that the reasons you have articulated for the attack on Boipatong are not the true reasons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> What I have said here before this Committee is the truth.  If you dispute it maybe you can give me the truth because you know you were present and you have your reasons as to why you're disputing my truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mthembu, when counsel puts questions to you it does not suggest that he was present when the attack took place.  The statements that he's putting to you as based on what he has been told by those individuals whom he represents, do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, Sir, I do understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So when he puts a proposition to you and you do not agree with it you must say so, either: "Yes, I agree with you, that is the reason" or "No, I do not agree with you", do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, Sir, I understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Mthembu, the reason I'm putting to you, the reason I put it to you, that you haven't disclosed the true reasons for the attack on Boipatong is because all the statements I've referred you to come up with either different reasons for the attack or they don't mention your reasons and in particular when you were asked: "When was it decided to attack Boipatong"?, you give two reasons or two events, one being an event which took place more than a year before the attack on Boipatong and the other one which has only to do with Mr Mkhize's beer supply being cut off.  That is why I'm putting it to you that you haven't disclosed the true reason for the attack on Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In all fairness to the witness you must also put to him that in his affidavit at page 29 he does indicate that Boipatong was selected as a target for the attacks because they also threatened the residents of Kwamadala Hostel.  They were not allowed to buy at Boipatong shops during the weekends and the residents who were IFP members were evicted from Boipatong.  They also necklaced the IFP members.  This he gives as the reason for the attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Chairperson, if I could just add.</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a>	That's in response Mr Berger to the direct question: "Why was Boipatong selected as the target of the attack"?  So I don't think you are being fair, as the Chairperson says, when you take the reason of the timeframe that's asked in 17.3, you don't add in the reason given in relation to 17.4 as well.  I just think you're stretching a bit otherwise.</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson and Mr Lax, I have canvassed with the witness the reasons that he has articulated about people being threatened from, people being prevented from shopping, people being evicted from Boipatong, people being killed.  I did that first.  I was focusing on 17.3, not to say that there isn't 17.4 but to say that in 17.3 he was asked for when and he focused on two events.</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I perfectly understand that but what we're trying to prevent is for you to put it as a fact that the only reasons he has advanced are those that you've just put to him.  That is what we are trying to prevent because I think that's unfair to the witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes, I'm just saying that in response to: "What were the events that triggered it"?, he gives two answers which I've just explained.</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a>	But Mr Mthembu, so as not to be unfair to you, let me ask you this, the two persons Gazu and Mbatha, were those two people necklaced?</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Were you told ever what the reason was for the attacks or have you worked out for yourself what the reason was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Mr Berger, I could also see people being attacked.  We kept burying people, burying the bones that had been, bones of people who had been necklaced at Boipatong and we also had meetings and they would tell us about a funeral where we had to go and bury a person and they were informing us about the death of the people at the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Mthembu, when was it decided to attack Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Perhaps for our benefit, is it an issue that there was animosity between the IFP and the ANC in Boipatong, in particular between the residents of Kwamadala Hostel and the residents of Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> It's not an issue Chairperson, that there was animosity.</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But what you are raising is what was the motive for the ultimate attack on Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Indeed yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You're saying that it had nothing to do with this animosity?</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And Chairperson, so that I don't go wider than I intend to, not all the residents of Boipatong were ANC members or ANC supporters or ANC sympathisers, there were ANC members and supporters and sympathisers in Boipatong.  There were ANC structures in Boipatong and there was animosity between ANC members in Boipatong and IFP members in Kwamadala.  That is not in dispute.</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  My colleague here, Mr Lax, just wants to make sure that he understands you correctly.  What is in issue here is the motive for the ultimate attack on Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The victims are saying that it had nothing to do with the animosity between the IFP and the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Mthembu, my question to you was, were you or were you not told by somebody about the reason for the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You were not told?</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No, I was not told, I witnessed the situation for myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you ever attend any meeting at which the possibility of an attack on Boipatong was discussed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> There was no other meeting except for the one on the 17th.</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The words: "Attack on Boipatong", either as a possibility or as a reality was never discussed at any IFP meeting other than the meeting on the 17th of June in the evening in the stadium, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, Sir, that's what I mean.</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And at that meeting, the one on the 17th of June there was no discussion at all about the reason for the attack, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> What I heard was that our people had died in multitudes in Boipatong and it had come to a point where we had to show them that the people who had been killed were also human beings.  Nobody should be killed without a reason.</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And who said that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> This was said by Damarra Chonco at the meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So then you were told about the reason for the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> At what stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> At the meeting on the 17th of June.</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, I thought that had always been his evidence, that at the meeting of the 17th they were told to go and attack Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, they were told to go and attack Boipatong, I'm asking him if they were told why they were going to go and attack, the reason for the attack and his original answer was that nobody told him about why they were going to attack Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a>	Isn't that what you said Mr Mthembu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> As I explained earlier on I witnesses that people were dying in Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Mthembu, please listen to my question.  My question to you is, were you told by anybody about the reason for the attack on Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I have explained that Damarra Chonco mentioned this at the meeting of the 17th.</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So you were told about the reason for the attack, the answer is yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Sir, I hope you understand when I say that on the meeting of the 17th Damarra said that it had come to a point where we could not tolerate this anymore and we had to show them that we could not tolerate it anymore.  That is what I've explained here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you agreed with Chonco, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> The mere fact that I went to Boipatong means that I agreed with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The fact that all your comrades also went to Boipatong means that they all agreed with Mr Chonco?</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What do you want him to say, to speak on behalf of the others?  It must follow that they agreed if they were there, one doesn't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> As far as you could see - well, let me ask you this then Mr Mthembu, when Mr Chonco said: "Our people are being killed in droves, it's time now, we must now go and kill them", what was the response of everyone else at that meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> The people who were there, even though I cannot recall what their response was, it became obvious to them that if the time had come for the people to be attacked then that be so.  It had come to a point where it was no longer tolerable.</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did they say anything at the meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I cannot say if they did because I did not hear anything thereafter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well I want you to think back to that meeting in the stadium.  All the male residents of the hostel were there, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Mr Berger, you should know that if you speak of: "all", some were at work, some were in the stadium so when you say: "all" I don't know what you mean.</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well at page 36, paragraph 2 you say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a>"A few minutes after the news I was surprised when the siren went and I noticed that they wanted all the people to go to the stadium where we used to hold meetings"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a>You said that all the people were called to the stadium.</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Berger, there must be a difference between saying: "the siren called all the people to the meeting" and whether in fact all the people were there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes Chairperson, ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think what he's trying to emphasise here is that he doesn't know whether all the people were there, there were people who were at work.  Unless there's really something that turns on the fact that everyone was there, no-one had gone to work on that day, on that night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> There were hundreds and hundreds of men in the stadium, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Mr Berger, you should understand what I'm saying.  That evening when I say all people went to the stadium I mean all the people who were present at Kwamadala Hostel that night.  I actually referred to the people who were at the hostel at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What he's asking you now is that there were hundreds and hundreds of men at the stadium.</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No, there were not hundreds.</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Approximately how many men were in the stadium.</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> About 200 to 300.</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I put it to you that many, many more than 300 people, some witnesses have put it between 800 and 1000 people attacked Boipatong that night, now it's your evidence that the men who were at the stadium then went to attack Boipatong.  So I'm putting to you that those men in the stadium must have numbered far in excess of 300 men, somewhere between 800 and 1000.</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Because I did not have a calculator I was not able to calculate how many there were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> At that time ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What Mr Berger is putting to you is this, you've estimated the men who were there at between 200 and 300, what Mr Berger is saying, according to his instructions there were approximately between 800 and 1000 men present at the stadium.  What do you say to that figure, do you agree with it or don't you agree with it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I would not agree or disagree with him if that is how he got his instruction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Would this perhaps be the appropriate time to take the tea adjournment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> As you please Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, very well.  We will return at half past eleven.</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">VICTOR MTHANDENI MTHEMBU:</span> (s.u.o.)</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Mthembu, you told the Committee last week that you were not targeting the residents generally of Boipatong but that you went to Boipatong to kill the members of the self-defence units, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Mr Berger, yes, that is so.  These very same self-defence units were ANC after all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Was that discussed at the stadium before you went to Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Mr Berger, I didn't hear that at the stadium.</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> At the stadium it was just said: "We are going to Boipatong to attack the people"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Why didn't you target specific people of the ANC who were known to live in Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Mr Berger, we went to attack for a reason, that our people were being killed, they couldn't go to the shops to buy and we therefore could not just go and attack people who were not known.</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well that's my point you see.  You were a leading member of one of the IFP structures in the Kwamadala Hostel, you had access to the other structure, that's the Senior Committee, Mr Vanana Zulu was the Chair of that committee and you had access to other structures in the Transvaal at that time in the IFP, so if you were concerned that the ANC was killing members of the IFP, why did you not identify those ANC people and go to Boipatong to kill them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Mr Berger, if you follow this up very carefully I will say that there was no time for us to go to those people, call upon them and talk to them because we too were afraid and one would not know when one was going to be attacked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I think what you're being asked is this, not every resident of Boipatong was responsible for killing IFP members or the residents from Kwamadala Hostel, now what you're being asked is why did you not go out into the township and only target those individuals who were responsible for the attack on the residents of Kwamadala Hostel or the IFP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I would say that I personally know that nobody had knowledge who was doing this but it was generally known that it was the ANC that was launching the attacks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Mthembu, you can't run away from IFP structures.  If you claim to have been a leader of the IFP you would know the structure of the IFP both in Kwamadala as well as in the Province as well as in the country, you would know what the various structures are, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Mr Berger, yes that is correct but I would like to explain that myself being Victor was not so much concentrating on the politics because many of us are not educated, we did not have the opportunity to acquire education and it is for that reason that I am saying I was not concentrating on political matters.  There were other things that I had to do like looking after my family and my children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Mthembu, it's your contention that your actions that night at Boipatong were political, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, that is correct Sir, because people who were in conflict were the ANC and the IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well then if this was a political problem between the ANC and the IFP, you as a leader of the IFP would have known of the IFP structures that were available to you, that you could have gone to determine who in the ANC was responsible for these killings or at least who in the ANC was in control in Boipatong, you say that you couldn't have done that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> As I have explained Sir, there are things that I was supposed to know and I didn't have to know everything else.  I was only leader, Vice-Chairman within the youth and I would not have known who was doing what and who was not doing what, that was not my responsibility.</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You were a political leader were you not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I was Deputy Chairperson within the youth of the IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And when the chairperson wasn't available then you acted as chairperson as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> This problem of IFP members being killed by ANC members was a political problem, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> That is correct Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And the political structures in the Kwamadala Hostel of the IFP knew very well who was in the political structures of the ANC in Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I have no knowledge of that Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I'm putting it to you that you're not telling the truth and I'll tell you why.  Mr Ernest Tsotso's house, the Chairperson of the ANC in Boipatong was attacked at a time when you were already an IFP leader in the hostel, how is it possible that you would not have known about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> As I have explained Sir, that I was not concentrating on politics considering that I was not educated.  These matters require educated people, not people like me and therefore I would not have known exactly how these things were happening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Are you telling the Committee that you went, you deliberately went to Boipatong to kill as many people as you possibly could in the hope that some of those who you killed would have been ANC members responsible for the violence against IFP members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You did not discriminate at all, whoever you saw was a potential target and had to be killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And even if that meant killing IFP supporters or PAC supporters who also lived in the township, so be it, was that your plan?</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Our aim was to go to the township to attack the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> It wasn't every ANC member that you wanted to kill, am I right?  It was only those ANC members who were in the self-defence units that you wanted to kill because they were responsible for the death of IFP members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Mr Berger, I am saying these people resided at Boipatong, they were ANC and these very same SDU members were also ANC.  These are the people who were necklacing our people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Mthembu, listen to my question.  There were IFP members in the township, there were PAC members in the township, you didn't want to kill them, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Mr Berger, as I have explained to you before that I did not have knowledge as to the existence of IFP members in the township.  I did explain this earlier on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I might just tell you that there was no Dlamini who was killed in Boipatong so your evidence about your girlfriend and her family seems to stand alone but let me come back to my question.  You only wanted to kill certain ANC members, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Mr Chairman, I'm sorry to interrupt but with respect, has this not been canvassed fairly fully before?  We've had the witnesses answer, there was an attack, innocent people, when I say innocent people, those who weren't ANC might well have been killed but this has been dealt with at length by Mr Berger, with respect, and I don't where it's getting us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, Mr Berger?</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, I want to get clarity from this witness that it was not all ANC members that he wanted to kill, it was only ANC members who were in the self-defence units.</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Berger, I think the issues that you're now dealing with have been sufficiently canvassed.  The record speaks for itself in this regard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I'd like to show you a map Mr Mthembu, of Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a>	Chairperson, we've made copies of this map.  Unfortunately we haven't made enough and I would ask my learned friends to share.  We have five copies of this map - the reason that it won't help to make copies of these is because we have coloured in in pink the houses where people were killed, we've indicated in green where people were injured and we've indicated in orange where houses were damaged but no-one was killed or injured.  If I could hand this up as Exhibit I.</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you discuss the contents of that map with your colleagues?</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> No, Chairperson, I haven't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is the status of that map?  Does that depict the area as it was then or as it is now or has there been no change?</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> As it was then.  It's taken from the evidence before the Criminal Court.</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Advocate Pretorius, have you had sight of this map?</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> I've seen a similar map.  My learned friend, Mr Strydom has one so I have had a look at it, thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay.  Do you have any objections to this document being placed before us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> I have no objection.</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Brink, do you have any objection to this document being placed before us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> No, no objection for what it's worth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Very well, shall we have that map?</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a>MAP OF BOIPATONG HANDED UP</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, I'm told it should be J not I.</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a>	Mr Mthembu, I'd like you to have a copy of this map.  Mr Mthembu, to give you directions, you'll see at the top there is Amatolo Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, I can see that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> That is north.  On the side, on the righthand side of this map you will see a whole lot of little houses dotted in pink, that is Slovo Park, it's on the eastern side of the township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Kwamadala Hostel is on the western side of the township, not depicted on this map.  It's to the west, in other words to the left of the map and you can see in the middle of the township there is a street called Umzumvubu, do you see that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And that's the street you say you entered the township on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Now all the houses dotted in pink, those are houses where people were killed.  The houses that are dotted in green, and some houses have both pink and green, the ones dotted in green are where people were injured but not killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, I'm sorry to interrupt.  This plan was also handed to me.  On the righthand side of the plan of the plan the informal settlements are shown, Slovo Part, and all those houses are marked pink.  Now I can give the Committee the assurance that there were some killings but not in all those houses, that's not correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, I was coming to that.  The reason is that not one house in Slovo Park was left unscathed.  The houses - it's not possible to identify in which houses people were killed but the majority of people who were killed were killed in Slovo Park.  I'm sure my learned friend will confirm that.  It's not to suggest that in every house in Slovo Park someone was killed.  We don't know in which houses they were killed but most people were killed there and not a single house was left unscathed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> These pink dots, do they depict the houses, all the houses in Slovo Park?</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes, they do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Because on it's face this map then indicates that in each an every house in Slovo Park people were killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Indeed, and I have to explain that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But in each and every house in Slovo Park people were killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> No.  There are no streets and there are no addresses in Slovo Park so it's very difficult to say: in this house someone was killed and not in that house, but what we're trying to indicate is that most of the people who were killed were killed in Slovo Park and not a single house in Slovo Park was left unscathed, not to say that a person was killed in every house in Slovo Park.  That is our difficulty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Because your key here reflects that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It is misleading.  Do you see what I'm saying?  Because you are not saying and you cannot say that people were killed in each and every one of these houses because it's impossible to do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Indeed and that is why ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now if it's impossible to do that, isn't  there another way of making sure that this is accurate in some respects?</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> No, Judge, Chairperson, we can't do that unless we colour them all in in orange and then say that just because they're coloured in in orange it doesn't mean that people weren't killed there.  You see there's that difficulty.  Perhaps what we should do ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Mr Berger, I'm hearing your problem but as the map stands it's misrepresenting the situation so what I'd like to suggest, subject to your colleagues being in agreement is that we ignore the colour pink there for the time being, that at the very least you colour them orange because you say not one house was left unscathed in the sense that they were all damaged and that you leave it as an open question as to which particular individual houses somebody got killed or injured in but that you at least put it to the witness that in those houses X number of people were killed and X number of people were injured.  That you do - you can say with some degree of certainly how many people died in Slovo Park and how many people were injured in Slovo Park although you can't say in which specific houses they were killed, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes, I'll do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Chairperson, ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What does the green represent?</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Injured Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> People were injured?</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Injured but not killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay, and then what does orange stand for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Houses that were damaged but no-one was killed or injured.</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> For all we know in these pink coloured houses, the houses were damaged?</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> All of them yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  And the occupants of those houses may well have been killed or injured?</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Perhaps you should find another formula then of reflecting that because the houses that we accept that all these houses we damaged but in the course of that damage people may have been killed or may have been injured.</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes, many were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And then you can give us a figure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes.  And what we'll do is we will change the Slovo Park colour to purple or something which will then be completely different.</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You can leave the pink except that you can indicate that pink reflects the houses that were damaged in which people could either have been killed or injured and then you can give us numbers in due course.</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> To assist my learned friend, I've got the advantage that I was in the criminal trial and I've got certain schedules here and I've calculated that 16 people were killed in Slovo Park and the total of house where these people were staying in, I think one person stayed in a caravan but also in Slovo Park but that can also be called a house, it's approximately nine houses where people were killed in Slovo Park.</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Maybe you can assist us by just giving us the rest of the stats and we get them done with in one go, you've worked them all out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Berger, do you accept what is said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I'm indebted to my learned friend.  I will produce the statistics as well but I accept for the time being that that is exactly what happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay, do we know how many people were injured there?  Was there any evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> I can also check that on this schedule of mine.   I calculate three people that testified at the criminal trial on charges of attempted murder but I must say that in my schedule I have certain people, I can calculate them but I don't have an address and they may also be people staying in Slovo Park but I'll calculate those people as well.  I've got 10 names here without addresses that may be people that stayed at Slovo Park at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you identifying them with reference to the charge of attempted murder?</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do these 10 include the other three?</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> It does not include the other there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So that's about 13 approximately?</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Ja.  I'm not sure about those addresses, I'll have to check them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Very well.  So you don't know whether they come from Slovo Park?</p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> No, the last 10 I don't know whether they're from Slovo Park, I just see on my schedule for some reason or another I did not add addresses and it may be because there was not a fixed address like one would expect in Slovo Park.</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay, very well.  Now Mr Berger, that's okay do take, no continue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a>RECORDING EQUIPMENT SWITCHED OFF</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, our information doesn't seem to tally with Mr Strydom's.  What we have is a schedule detailing all the victims of the attack, house numbers in Slovo Park, people who were killed, people who were injured, as well as people in Boipatong and perhaps we could make this available to the Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But insofar as Mr Mthembu is concerned now, what is it that you want to canvass with him in regard to this, because it may well be that with the assistance of Mr Strydom who was at the proceedings, you can check his information as against your instructions and then perhaps in due course you could then submit to the Committee the revised key to the map which would indicate to us, on the basis of an agreed fax, that is the position if you can but if you can't then you'd have to present that conflicting information.  I'm just concerned about the relevance of the figures.  Are the figures really relevant to cross-examination of this witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> No, no they're not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> They're not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> They're not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay, very well.  Do you think that can be done?</p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> That can be done at a later stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, indeed.  If you want to canvass anything in regard to this map on a broad basis then I think you can do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes, that's what I intended to do, thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay.  And then perhaps if you two could just get together as soon as you can so that you can just get this information, in particular with regard to the key.</p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> We'll do that, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a>	Mr Mthembu, coming back to this map in front of you, leave out of account for the time being Slovo Park. Now in Boipatong itself, what you see as orange, those are the houses that were attacked, pink is where people were killed and green is where people were injured.  Do you understand this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> In Slovo Park, all those houses that you see there in pink, they were attacked and in some of the houses people were killed and others were injured.  Okay?</p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Now, you will notice that there is a large section of Boipatong that was not touched by the attack.  You can see the lefthand side of the map and about two thirds of the way up you will see that there is no orange, no pink and no green which means that those houses were not attacked.  Do you see that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Do you know why that is?</p>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I do not have knowledge of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> In your affidavits, in one of them, I don't have the reference now, you say that the attackers surrounded Boipatong, do you remember saying that in your affidavit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> It's then difficult to understand, if the attackers surrounded Boipatong and then everybody went in to attack, how it is that there is a whole section of Boipatong that is not affected by the attackers.  Would you agree it's quite strange?</p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> As I explained earlier Mr Berger that the amount or the number that I've explained, the 200 or 300 people I referred to, if you look at this map it shows the area of Boipatong and it is not possible for the number of people that I mentioned to surround the entire township as reflected on the map.</p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> But you yourself entered the township from Umzumvubu Street.  Now you can see that the entrance to the township, that entrance that you're came in on is on the lefthand side of the map in the middle of the page, that's where you entered to the township.  You can see it's written there: Umzumvubu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> As you are explaining as a person who doesn't know Boipatong well it is obvious from the map where we gained entrance into Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well you told the Committee that you entered on Umzumvubu Street.  I'm just pointing out where that is on the map.  You can see it half way down the page but on the extreme lefthand side of the map, you see there Umzumvubu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, I see it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Now my point is this, if you and many of your co-attackers entered the township at that point to kill people, to damage their houses, to destroy their property, why is it that there is no destruction at all for approximately one kilometre into Boipatong, all the way along Umzumvubu Street until you get to Lekwa Street, you can see there's a park in the centre, all the way down to Bapedi Street, Majola Street, Barolong Street, Mosheshwe, going up from Umzumvubu, Mpeka Street, Batswana Street.  It's only when you get to Batswana Street you can see two houses there that were attacked.  Do you see that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, I see it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So my question to you is this, you've entered the township, you're spreading out and yet you  don't attack a single house.  The question is, why not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Mr Berger, I think I told you before that I did not know Boipatong well.   What you should note is that where it's written "Kwamadala" on the left-hand side of the map, did you say this is where houses are burnt down?   What you must understand is that, as a person who doesn't know Boipatong, this is where we gained entrance into Boipatong, where houses and some people were injured.</p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> No, Mr Mthembu, you told the Committee that you entered Boipatong on Umzumvubu Street and you knew it was Umzumvubu Street because you saw the sign.   Now, we can see where Umzumvubu Street is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I see it, Mr Berger, but what you should know, I am trying to explain this, that as a person who doesn't know Boipatong well, if I say we went through Umzumvubu, I am trying to explain that this side of the township we went in through, from Kwamadala Hostel it is obvious from the map that which side we would enter through.</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You see, what is being put to you is that when you testified, you suggested in your evidence that you entered Boipatong, that is you personally entered Boipatong through Umzumvubu Street, do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now what's being put to you is, if one accepts that you entered Boipatong through Umzumvubu Street, as you can see in Exhibit G, okay, there is nothing on the map which indicates that there is any damage to any of the houses near Umzumvubu Street.   The first, at least damage to the house only occurred as from Bapedi Street.   Do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So why is it that no house was then damaged, you only started damaging houses in Bapedi Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I do not know how that happened, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Mthembu, you must have an explanation for how that happened, because, according to you, you were simply told at the stadium, "We're going to attack Boipatong", no other plans were discussed at the stadium, or at any time, according to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> In other words, are you trying to tell me that, as we are going to attack, there are many spaces in that map reflecting that there were people who were not attacked, are you trying to tell me that we should have attacked this area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I'm asking you why you did not attack this area, there's a whole area and you... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Mr Berger, I do not know how this area was not attacked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Particularly since this is the area where you yourself was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well the answer is, "I don't know what happened".   You can't take it further.</p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Mthembu, I'll suggest to you why this area wasn't attacked... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Are you dividing this area into two?   What I know is that people were attacked in Boipatong.   If you ask me why we didn't attack some people or some of the area, I do not have a response to that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Isn't it correct that Mr Vanana Zulu's house was in Majola Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> It is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And I can tell you that his house was in this area of Majola Street that wasn't attacked, and that in this area of Boipatong, the residents were mainly Zulu and Xhosa speaking.   Wasn't this area deliberately left alone?</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I have no knowledge about that, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you see the strangest thing of it all is that Mr Tsotso's house is also in Majola Street, in fact it's almost across the road from where Mr Vanana Zulu's house was, and his house, Mr Tsotso's house, also wasn't attacked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Can I just ask Mr Berger, if you say the people at Majola speak Zulu and Xhosa, what language does Mr Tsotso speak?</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The point is, Mr Tsotso was the chairperson of the ANC in the area, his house was left untouched because he was living in an area where there were predominantly Zulu and Xhosa speaking people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Maybe you did not understand my question, I asked what language Mr Tsotso speaks?</p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Mthembu, can I ask the questions?    What I'm putting to you is that, if you were targeting the ANC, you would have targeted Mr Tsotso's house, but you didn't, you left his house alone, because he was in an area of people that you knew might be sympathetic to the IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> That is your own opinion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> If you were targeting the ANC, Mr Mthembu, can you tell the Committee why it is that three year old Mita Moleti, that little girl who's in the wheelchair today, why she was stabbed, in fact her skull was hacked with a panga, can you explain that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Mr Berger, what I can say is the residents of Boipatong were being attacked, we did not discriminate, it was not discriminated against as to who was being attacked, how old they were, all in all the residents of Boipatong were being attacked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So three year old Mita Moleti was a fair target, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Mr Berger, what I'm saying is that the residents of Boipatong were attacked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You see, the reason I'm asking you this question,  Mr Mthembu, is that Mita Moleti wants to know, she wants to know why was her skull hacked with a panga?</p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I would not know how to explain this, because the person you speak of is somebody I hope resided in Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Not only her, there was nine month old Erin Matope who was stabbed in the head and killed.   My question to you is why, if you were attacking the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> What you should understand, Mr Berger, is that a snake gives birth to another snake.</p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, could that please be repeated, I didn't hear the answer in the uproar?</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The witness said a snake gives birth to another snake.</p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, Mr Brink?</p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And I take it that you would give the same answer for five year old Agnes Malindi who was killed, five year old Poppie Mbatha who was killed, eight year old Sibusiso Mzibe who was killed, seven year old Mthombe Vikile Nonjoli who was killed, same answer for all of them, "a snake gives birth to another snake", and that's why they were killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Mr Berger, what you should know is that when we went to attack, we went to attack the ANC, maybe the people you mention were also ANC people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> How can a nine month old baby be a member of the ANC responsible for killing IFP members, how on earth can that be possible?</p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Maybe you don't know what the situation was like at the time.   I don't know how you want me to clarify this any further.</p>
<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Mthembu, I'm talking about a nine month old child.   Please listen to my question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Mr Berger, we also have children, we also have babies, nine month old babies, who were burnt in the township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Can you give me the name of the nine month old baby that was burnt?</p>
<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I would not, because families would come to the hostel and say that they were being terrorised in the township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> There was no nine month old baby that was killed in the township by members of the Self Defence Unit or any ANC member, the only nine month old baby that was killed was Erin Matope, who was killed by you and your fellow attackers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> In other words, Mr Berger, if I have a baby and my organisation, IFP, where will this child belong to, or this baby belong to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So, if I understand your evidence correctly, Mr Mthembu, it didn't matter how young the babies were, they were to be killed because it was possible that their parents might have been ANC members, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Mr Berger, ANC people were attacked and they had children, young children who were innocent, therefore if a baby was killed, that could have happened because of the situation in the township and the community at large.</p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The babies and the young children were killed because their parents might have been ANC supporters, is that correct, because, as you put it, a snake gives birth to another snake?</p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Mr Berger, I have responded to your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well then let me ask you this, Mr Mthembu, if it was your desire to kill all the snakes in Boipatong, no matter even if the snakes were nine months old, why do you say that you hid two little children under the bed in the house that you went into?</p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Mr Berger, what I expressed by a snake giving birth to another snake was a idiomatic expression.</p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Mthembu, you can't run away from that answer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Put the question to him please again, he didn't understand well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line546"><a name="pos546"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You told the Committee, when I asked you why was a nine month old baby killed, you said, "A snake gives birth to another snake".   If that is so, why did you not kill the two little snakes that you found, or that you say you put under the bed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> But I also have children as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line548"><a name="pos548"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well then your answers are not making sense.  I'm going to ask you one more time and then I'm going to move on... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is it that you want to establish from this witness?   The record speaks for itself.   People were killed there, regardless of their age, whether they were young or old, it didn't matter, they were there to kill anyone.   His evidence is also that he personally decided to tell those two young children to get under the bed because he didn't want to kill them, because as he has told us, he has children too.   That's what appears in the record.   It seems to me you can't argue with the witness, it's an argument that's being addressed to us.   The record speaks for itself, the point has been made.</p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Mr Chairman, also from a point of view of clarity, can we get on the record whether or not it's Mr Berger's instruction that the applicant was responsible for the death of the nine month old child and the, I think it was a three year old, whether he was responsible himself, personally responsible?   I'd like that on record.</p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, I don't understand Mr Brink's objection.</p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But what he wants to find out is, are your instructions that the applicant, that is Mthembu, killed the nine month old?</p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> No, I don't have those instructions, but... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Thank you, that was all I wanted, because if it was suggested that he was responsible for those two murders of  those two children, then of course no doubt he has evidence to that effect, but if he's not suggesting it, then it makes things clearer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> But, Chairperson, it's not to say that Mr Mthembu did not kill those children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But that's a matter for argument.   All that Mr Brink is raising is raising at the factual level whether is it intended to be alleged that Mr Mthembu killed those two young children you mentioned, and your answer is no, he didn't, you don't have those instructions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> No, but Mr Mthembu is legally responsible for the death of those two children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That's a matter for argument, you know that, Mr Berger, that's a matter for argument.   If you want to put it to him that in law he's legally responsible, then by all means do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Brink, I can also put on record that we're not in a position to say who killed who either in respect of any of the applicants.</p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Mr Chairman, it wasn't by way of an objection, it was to get clarity, that was all, because the way the cross-examination was going seemed to suggest that this applicant was responsible for those deaths and the snake killing the snake and that sort of thing, but now it's been made clear, that's the end of the matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> As I understand the line of questioning, it seems to suggest that even though he did not personally kill any one of the other persons, he is nevertheless legally responsible for their death.  Is that the point you want to make?</p>
<p class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> That is the point, but... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ja.</p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, perhaps I should get direction from the Committee.   Am I not supposed to examine this particular witness on the deaths of old people, young people and babies, because I can't say that this witness actually killed all of them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, no-one is suggesting that.   All that we are saying to you, all that Mr Brink was saying to you is to indicate whether it is alleged, it would be alleged by the victims that he personally killed those persons.   If that is not the allegation, you are free to cross-examine the witness in regard to his legal responsibility to do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line566"><a name="pos566"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, if any of the residents of Boipatong were able to identify a particular person as killing a particular loved one, then I'm sure they would have given evidence at the trial to that effect.   The conviction was on the basis of common purpose precisely because people cannot say who killed who, and that was apparent at the trial stage.   Well I've asked you about the children... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you still remember the question that was put to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line568"><a name="pos568"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> May you please repeat the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You told us in your evidence that you did not kill or injure the two young children who are either twins or looked like twins, because you yourself had children, you were a parent.</p>
<p class="line" id="line570"><a name="pos570"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You've told the Committee now that in attacking Boipatong, no distinction was made as to the age of the residents, whether you're young or old, it didn't matter, you had to be killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, sir, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Then how do you reconcile this last statement with your earlier statement?   Do you understand that?   Answer the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Sir, as I have explained that we went to attack the ANC's at Boipatong.   I know that children were injured, we were not necessarily looking at the age and it is therefore for this reason that we were not looking at a person's age.</p>
<p class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mthembu, that we understand perfectly well, but what Mr Berger wants you to reconcile is your conduct in telling those young children to get under the bed because you didn't want to harm them, because you're a parent.   How do you reconcile that with the attitude of the attackers that everyone in the Boipatong township had to be killed regardless of the age?   Do you understand the question?   Would you want me to put the question in Zulu to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I do understand, sir, but I don't quite understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> (Puts question in Zulu).   When you arrived at the house where these two children were killed, you have told the Committee that as a parent, you did not want to injure the children and you instructed them to hide under the bed, and now you are telling the Committee, when Boipatong was being attacked, you were not discriminating child, father, young and old, everybody were going to be killed.   I am saying to you, would you please explain this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Sir, the two children were instructed to hide under the bed because I was sympathetic, I realised that they were still young, they knew nothing.   People who had to answer had already fled, but these two young children knew nothing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Mthembu, you never hid those two children under the bed, if you could have killed them, you would have killed them, isn't that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The only explanation that you have for small babies being killed is because they were the children of people who might have been ANC members, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Sir, we were not looking at anything like who's whose father or mother, we were just going to attack the people at Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I can give you the names of all the young people, but I'm sure it won't make any difference.   Let me ask you this, old people were also killed, I can give you examples:  at 1183 Mosheshwe Street a 63 year old woman, Nellie Kugu, was stabbed repeatedly in the upper thighs and shot three times;  at 45 Majola Street, 62 year old Belina Lerobane died, after receiving multiple stab wounds and being shot four times in the neck.   There are other examples of old people who were shot and stabbed.   Is your answer the same, it did not matter how old or how young, if you were a resident of Boipatong, you were a target to be killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes sir, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line585"><a name="pos585"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And it didn't matter whether you were an ANC member or not, as long as you were a resident of Boipatong, you were a target to be killed, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line586"><a name="pos586"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Mr Berger, people at Boipatong were attacked and I wouldn't say whether a person was a member of the ANC or that organisation, there's nothing I can say about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And it's not that people were just shot once or stabbed once, there are numerous examples of people who were repeatedly shot and repeatedly hacked and stabbed.   One woman in fact was so badly stabbed, a middle-aged woman, so badly stabbed that you couldn't even count the number of stab wounds on her body.   Do you have any explanation for why people were butchered in this way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line588"><a name="pos588"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Mr Berger, I understand and believe that - Mr Berger, we went to attack people, it was a fight in a war situation, and yourself, as Mr Berger, if you were fighting someone, really, I don't know how you would go about doing that, we were actually fighting these people, and I won't know how many times a person was stabbed, etcetera.</p>
<p class="line" id="line589"><a name="pos589"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Many people were killed while they were sleeping.  I can tell you a woman, Elizabeth Malindi, she was stabbed 15 times in her bed while sleeping, and there are plenty of other examples of people who were sleeping when they were killed.   Again, if I understand you correctly, they were fair targets as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Mr Berger, you are saying these people were sleeping, but they were sleeping at Boipatong township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The same would be true for Maria Mlangene, who was pregnant at the time, she was stabbed, her foetus was killed, she was just in Boipatong, she was a target?</p>
<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Do you want an answer on that as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line593"><a name="pos593"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line594"><a name="pos594"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I think I have already explained that she too was attacked because she was found at Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Why was property looted, why was so much property stolen from Boipatong, what was the reason for that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line596"><a name="pos596"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Mr Berger, I wouldn't explain really how that happened, but myself as Zulu, as far as I know, I discovered that, I think you too know history, there was a time when Shaka attacked people and he would confiscate the cattle, their cattle, as a sign of his victory.</p>
<p class="line" id="line597"><a name="pos597"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> If you would look at page 38, paragraph 8, of your affidavit?   You say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line598"><a name="pos598"></a>"We could recognise each other even at night, because we had white bandages around our heads in order to distinguish our partners.   We continued to kill the residents of Boipatong until we came to the end of the township.   Others stole the property inside the houses, like two plate stoves, TV's and blankets, because it was winter time and it was very cold inside Kwamadala Hostel.   Maybe we took an hour or half an hour, I cannot remember."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line599"><a name="pos599"></a>You say property was stolen as a sign of victory?</p>
<p class="line" id="line600"><a name="pos600"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> As I was explaining here, I was explaining in terms of the tradition, that Shaka would conquer his enemies and confiscate the livestock.   We did not necessarily take these things as an indication of victory over these people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line601"><a name="pos601"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Why did you take the things then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line602"><a name="pos602"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Mr Berger, I wouldn't really answer that question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line603"><a name="pos603"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well, you say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line604"><a name="pos604"></a>"People stole blankets because it was winter time and it was very cold."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line605"><a name="pos605"></a>That was why they stole blankets, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line606"><a name="pos606"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line607"><a name="pos607"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Why did they steal TV's and stoves?</p>
<p class="line" id="line608"><a name="pos608"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I cannot answer that, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line609"><a name="pos609"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> People stole meat and food, why did they do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line610"><a name="pos610"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Where is that, sir, I don't know that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line611"><a name="pos611"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I'll give you an example, at 805 Bafokeng Street, there was a family who lived there, Victor Mkwana and his family.   When the attackers came, they ran into a back room and they barricaded the door and the windows with all the furniture that was in the room, and fortunately they survived, and after the attackers had left, they came out of the room, they found the sitting room had been smashed completely, the front door had been broken down, the chairs had been slashed with pangas, wall unit broken, from the wall unit the attackers had taken a portable television set, a large colour television set, a video cassette recorder, dinner service and so on, ornaments, and food from a locked cupboard which had been forced open.   There were bullet holes inside the house, a grandfather clock was stolen, the Disa telephone was stolen, more food in the sideboard was stolen, the dining room door was smashed, all the food in the fridge was stolen, in the main bedroom, blankets, duvets, pillows, linen, shirts, shoes, an overcoat and numerous other items of clothing were stolen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line612"><a name="pos612"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Berger, perhaps you should give us a list of all the items that were stolen.   Seek an agreement from your colleagues to find out whether they are taking issue with whether or not food and all the other items that you are enumerating were stolen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line613"><a name="pos613"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What we'll do, Chairperson, is we will put together a list of not only things that were stolen, but people who were killed and how they were killed and all of that, we will put it to our learned friends, ask for their agreement and then hand in a memorandum to the Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line614"><a name="pos614"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It will be very helpful, rather than going through the list of - and putting it to the witness, who apparently says he doesn't know why they were stolen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line615"><a name="pos615"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You do know, Mr Mthembu, do you not, that a vast amount of loot, by that I mean blankets, television sets and so on, all the kinds of things that I have described, were stolen from Boipatong by the attackers that night, you know that, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line616"><a name="pos616"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Berger, as you've just explained, I don't know why they were stealing these things, if they indeed stole these things.</p>
<p class="line" id="line617"><a name="pos617"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think what, as I understand the question, what is being put to you is this, do you accept that in the course of the attack at Boipatong certain items were stolen by the attackers, such as food, television sets and a whole variety of other goods, a list of which will be handed to us in due course?</p>
<p class="line" id="line618"><a name="pos618"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line619"><a name="pos619"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you don't know why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line620"><a name="pos620"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line621"><a name="pos621"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Is your explanation about King Shaka then just something that you surmise, or is that an explanation which was given to you by somebody?</p>
<p class="line" id="line622"><a name="pos622"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> As I am explaining that I am giving you an example about what I learnt in the history of Amazulu.  Yourself as a white person would not understand this thing.  For example, women would also be abducted to become Shaka's subjects after the conquest, he would confiscate the livestock so that he could feed his people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line623"><a name="pos623"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Mthembu, was the attack on Boipatong an IFP attack, or was the attack a Zulu attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line624"><a name="pos624"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Mr Berger, the attack on Boipatong was about these two organisations, the IFP and the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line625"><a name="pos625"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> After the attack, you went back to the stadium, where you all gathered, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line626"><a name="pos626"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No, no, I don't remember something like that happening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line627"><a name="pos627"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> If the Committee will just bear with me please.  Mr Mthembu, I can't find it now, but I'll find the reference later and come back to it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line628"><a name="pos628"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well perhaps you should try and find it now, so that we can, because we, you know, we've been going on with this witness for a long time, I think at some point we, you know, we have to come to the end of the cross-examination, so we'll give you time to look - to find the passage and go on with your cross-examination.</p>
<p class="line" id="line629"><a name="pos629"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> After the attackers came back from Boipatong, they went back to the stadium.   Mr Mthembu says they did not go back to the stadium.</p>
<p class="line" id="line630"><a name="pos630"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well is that where they're supposed to have gone back and when they're supposed to have burnt down the property?</p>
<p class="line" id="line631"><a name="pos631"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> No, no, that wasn't that night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line632"><a name="pos632"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Is that, sorry, is that when they had to hand over their weapons back... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line633"><a name="pos633"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line634"><a name="pos634"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> ...then the (indistinct) is on page 16, paragraph 33.</p>
<p class="line" id="line635"><a name="pos635"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> No, no, this doesn't refer to that night, but thank you.   Mr Mthembu, your evidence is that you never went, the attackers never went back to the stadium after the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line636"><a name="pos636"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Mr Berger, I think you are asking me, I came back and I just went away, I didn't go to the stadium, I don't know what happened there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line637"><a name="pos637"></a><span class="speaker">MS CLOETE:</span> May I assist, where on page 39, paragraph 10 deals when they went back to the stadium - when they went back to Kwamadala Hostel, and he says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line638"><a name="pos638"></a>"By that time, I heard the sound of ambulances.  I knew they were then taking all the people who were injured to hospital.   I was so tired, because it was the first time that I had done such things.   I went to sleep because I was doing day shift."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line639"><a name="pos639"></a>That's the only reference I can get.</p>
<p class="line" id="line640"><a name="pos640"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> All right.   Mr Mthembu, subsequent to the attack, there were meetings in the hostel, in particular there was a meeting on the Friday, the 19th of June, am I correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line641"><a name="pos641"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line642"><a name="pos642"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you discuss with any of your fellow attackers or was it ever discussed in your present what had happened at Boipatong on the night of the 17th of June?</p>
<p class="line" id="line643"><a name="pos643"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Mr Berger, what I know was discussed there was that it was no longer possible for hostel residents to go to the shops in the township.   There were many police blockading the streets and people could no longer go to work.   That was what was discussed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line644"><a name="pos644"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> How did you know that people had stolen blankets and television sets and two plate stoves from Boipatong, how did you know that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line645"><a name="pos645"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I knew about this.   When we arrived back, for example, it was indicated that if there was something that was looted at Boipatong, these things should be burned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line646"><a name="pos646"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> That was on the Friday?</p>
<p class="line" id="line647"><a name="pos647"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line648"><a name="pos648"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> But how did you know what had been looted from Boipatong, that's what I'm asking?   Surely you must have discussed it with your fellow attackers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line649"><a name="pos649"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> These things were brought in front of people, they were burnt in my presence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line650"><a name="pos650"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You also knew that young children and old people had been killed in the attack, am I correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line651"><a name="pos651"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Mr Berger, I did not have knowledge about that, I only knew about this during our criminal trial.</p>
<p class="line" id="line652"><a name="pos652"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You never discussed it with any of your fellow comrades prior to the criminal trial?</p>
<p class="line" id="line653"><a name="pos653"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No sir, I don't remember discussing it with anyone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line654"><a name="pos654"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> How many, when you came back from Boipatong, you then didn't even know if anyone had been killed, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line655"><a name="pos655"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes sir, I didn't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line656"><a name="pos656"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> When did you discover for the first time that people had actually been killed in Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line657"><a name="pos657"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I heard when I arrived at work on a Thursday morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line658"><a name="pos658"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Who told you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line659"><a name="pos659"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> My colleagues at work.</p>
<p class="line" id="line660"><a name="pos660"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And they told you that children had been killed and old people had been killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line661"><a name="pos661"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> They told me that people had been killed at Boipatong, killed by Inkatha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line662"><a name="pos662"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Please have a look at page 38, paragraph 7.   You say there</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line663"><a name="pos663"></a>"We came from an easterly direction to Boipatong, and we started breaking windows and doors.   All property inside the homes had to be broken.   If we came across a human being, we had to kill him or her with pangas and spears.   We killed even young children, because these impis were now angry and this anger was caused by the intelezi(?) that was sprinkled on us.   We did not know how many people we killed or injured during that night of the attack."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line664"><a name="pos664"></a>Is that paragraph correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line665"><a name="pos665"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, it is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line666"><a name="pos666"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> If you came from an easterly direction to Boipatong, it means you started your killing spree in Slovo Park, doesn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line667"><a name="pos667"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> As far as I know, I was explaining the direction from which we came, an easterly direction.   Westerly direction, I don't know if you know where Slovo Park is?</p>
<p class="line" id="line668"><a name="pos668"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> If one goes to Boipatong and one looks at Slovo Park and Boipatong, the distinction is very, is not very clear, there's one street on one side of the road is Boipatong, on the other side of the road is Slovo Park, and Slovo Park is a very small area.   So what I'm saying to you is that you were part of the attackers that started on the eastern side of the township and you made your way through the township, isn't that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line669"><a name="pos669"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I hear that from you, I don't know about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line670"><a name="pos670"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You see, Mr Mthembu, the attackers attacked Boipatong from different angles, different sides, some came from the east or from the side of... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line671"><a name="pos671"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Wait a minute, what do you say to that?   It's being put to you that the attackers attacked Boipatong from different sides, what do you say to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line672"><a name="pos672"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I will not be able to say that they came from different directions, but from what you have explained, this is the route taken by the attackers, but I cannot comment where they came from, or the route that they used.</p>
<p class="line" id="line673"><a name="pos673"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> How did you get out of the hostel, what route did you take?</p>
<p class="line" id="line674"><a name="pos674"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> We took the route that went along the main gate at Kwamadala.</p>
<p class="line" id="line675"><a name="pos675"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You went out of the main gate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line676"><a name="pos676"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line677"><a name="pos677"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you then came along Noble Boulevard, you went under the bridge towards Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line678"><a name="pos678"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line679"><a name="pos679"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And when you got to the corner of Noble Boulevard and Frikkie Meyer Boulevard, you then split into various groups, is that what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line680"><a name="pos680"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I did not see when we separated, but I just realised when we entered the township that we were now entering the township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line681"><a name="pos681"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You see because if you look at the map in front of you, some of the attackers started or came from the east, that is in the area around Slovo Park, and those attackers, after they had finished with Slovo Park... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line682"><a name="pos682"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Berger, where is that indicated on the map?</p>
<p class="line" id="line683"><a name="pos683"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> It's not indicated on the map, Chairperson.   I'm putting to the witness the areas from which the attackers came and I'm asking him to look at the map so that he can orientate himself.   If it will assist the Committee, we can put arrows onto the map, just to indicate the directions in which we say the attackers came.   Some of the attackers moved down into Slovo Park, others moved across the northern side of Boipatong, and eventually exited out Bafokeng Street, do you see there at the top there, the second street is Bafokeng?</p>
<p class="line" id="line684"><a name="pos684"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line685"><a name="pos685"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And then a third group of attackers came from the southern side of the township, entering the township via Lekwa Street, it's at the bottom in the middle there, and moving along different streets towards the east and towards the north, and then also making their way out along Bafokeng Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line686"><a name="pos686"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Mr Chairperson, I don't think there has been any evidence before this Committee that there were three groups in the township that night.   If my learned friend put it to him and asked him whether there were three groups, then I agree, but you put it to him as a fact.   I don't think that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line687"><a name="pos687"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I'm assuming that there would be evidence, you know, coming from Mr Berger indicating that, you know, there were three groups.</p>
<p class="line" id="line688"><a name="pos688"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Then I'll leave it at that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line689"><a name="pos689"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What I can say, Chairperson, is that if one analyses the houses which were attacked that night, and that analysis has been done, certain routes, also on the basis of eye witness accounts of people, certain routes were plotted, and there... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line690"><a name="pos690"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Look, you can get on to the point.   Continue with your questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line691"><a name="pos691"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Thank you, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line692"><a name="pos692"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line693"><a name="pos693"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Mthembu, it appears that the attackers struck, I'll put it this way, the attackers struck from three main areas, three different main areas, one being in Slovo Park, one being along the northern side of Boipatong and the other being from the southern side, moving east and north.   Can you help the Committee as to whether or not there were in fact three groups of attackers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line694"><a name="pos694"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Mr Berger, you are telling me that there were indeed three groups.   What I can say is, according to your map, or rather as reflected in your map, I think people have told you how the attackers conducted the attack, you were not there.   Hearsay and what you see for yourself are two different things.</p>
<p class="line" id="line695"><a name="pos695"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It's being put to you, either as a fact or as a suggestion, is that there appears to have been three groups or attacks from three directions.   What do you say to that, do you have any personal knowledge of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line696"><a name="pos696"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I do not have any knowledge about that, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line697"><a name="pos697"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Also, there is evidence that the attackers who started attacking from Slovo Park were in fact transported to Slovo Park in police vehicles?</p>
<p class="line" id="line698"><a name="pos698"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I have no knowledge of that, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line699"><a name="pos699"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What I want to put to you, Mr Mthembu, is that this attack on Boipatong and Slovo Park must have been very well planned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line700"><a name="pos700"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I have no knowledge of that, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line701"><a name="pos701"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I want to read to you what your lawyers said on your behalf at the criminal trial.   Chairperson, I'm reading from page 78 of a document, the heads of argument which were submitted on behalf of the accused at the trial.   It is said there on your behalf</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line702"><a name="pos702"></a>"Ten eerste is dit duidelik op die totaliteit van die getuienis dat die aanval gepaard moes gegaan het met uiterste fyn beplanning en met militere presisie uitgevoer is."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line703"><a name="pos703"></a>In other words, the evidence which was led at the criminal trial made it clear that the attack... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line704"><a name="pos704"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That's a submission by the lawyers who were acting on his behalf at the trial?</p>
<p class="line" id="line705"><a name="pos705"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Indeed, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line706"><a name="pos706"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you follow what's being put to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line707"><a name="pos707"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> There was evidence led, and I'm sure that that evidence about who was killed and where they were killed and so on is not disputed, and your lawyers said on your behalf that it was clear from that evidence that the attack must have been preceded by very careful planning, if my translation is accurate, and that it was carried out with military precision.   Now, I want to ask you, or I want to put it to you that your evidence cannot be true that you were simply called to the stadium and told, "We're now going to attack Boipatong" and there was no planning, all that happened was, you all got your weapons and off you went to kill as many people as possible, that is not the way it happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line708"><a name="pos708"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I was responding to your questions and I was telling you what I knew and what happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line709"><a name="pos709"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> At your trial, your lawyers submitted that, on the evidence in court that had been led before the Court, it was clear that the attack on Boipatong had been planned, well planned, and was executed with what was described as military precision.   Do you understand what your lawyers said on your behalf at the criminal trial?</p>
<p class="line" id="line710"><a name="pos710"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, I understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line711"><a name="pos711"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you agree with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line712"><a name="pos712"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I do not agree with what the lawyers said, because I was sentenced despite their claims.</p>
<p class="line" id="line713"><a name="pos713"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Given the submission made on your behalf by your legal representative at court, which was based on the evidence in court, your evidence before this Committee that you were simply called onto the stadium without any prior knowledge and told to go and attack Boipatong is simply not true, is that what you... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line714"><a name="pos714"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes, that is what I wanted to say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line715"><a name="pos715"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What's your comment on that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line716"><a name="pos716"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> What I can say is that I was called into the stadium on that day and told about it.   I cannot comment on what the lawyers said, because I don't know about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line717"><a name="pos717"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You've told the Committee that you've not been trained, well let me not misrepresent to you, you have not had military training, you've just been to the shooting range?</p>
<p class="line" id="line718"><a name="pos718"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line719"><a name="pos719"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You cannot explain how it is that the attack appeared to have been carried out with military precision, you just say, "We went along with no planning and killed people at random", am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line720"><a name="pos720"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line721"><a name="pos721"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you, you went along willingly, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line722"><a name="pos722"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line723"><a name="pos723"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Berger, how many more questions do you have of this witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line724"><a name="pos724"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, I have approximately eight or nine pages of questions for this witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line725"><a name="pos725"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay, maybe we should adjourn at this stage.  We'll return at quarter past two.</p>
<p class="line" id="line726"><a name="pos726"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS </p>
<p class="line" id="line727"><a name="pos727"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> ...requested by one of the interpreters to draw the Committee's attention to the fact that when Mr Lax asks questions, having to share a microphone with you, Mr Chairman, his questions aren't easily audible, and if possible, when Mr Lax does want to ask a question, if he could take your microphone and put it in front of him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line728"><a name="pos728"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I see, Mr Berger, that you have just, you've handed us your heads of argument on the (indistinct).   Yes, thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line729"><a name="pos729"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes, I've also furnished Mr Brink with a copy, because I thought he might be interested in the argument.</p>
<p class="line" id="line730"><a name="pos730"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Yes, indeed, indeed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line731"><a name="pos731"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> All right, so everyone has a copy of this.  We can go on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line732"><a name="pos732"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> No, not the counsel for the SADF nor counsel for Mr Mthembu, I didn't think that they were interested, but if they are interested in this argument, we can... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line733"><a name="pos733"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Apparently you have a passing interest in the matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line734"><a name="pos734"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> There is no urgency about it, Mr Berger.</p>
<p class="line" id="line735"><a name="pos735"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> They said they have a passing interest in the matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line736"><a name="pos736"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well it doesn't affect any of their clients, that's the point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line737"><a name="pos737"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, excepting of course if they want to be drawn into the argument, which is their privilege.   Yes, very well, Mr Mthembu, might I remind you that you're still under oath.</p>
<p class="line" id="line738"><a name="pos738"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Mr Chairperson, I just would like to report, I did speak to the State advocate, unfortunately they do not have the map at hand, he'll try and get hold of it, but he doesn't think he'll be successful, but he will let me know as soon as he can get it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line739"><a name="pos739"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It would have been handed in as an exhibit though, would it not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line740"><a name="pos740"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Apparently it was on loan from the South African Defence Force, but he will see what he can do about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line741"><a name="pos741"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well your colleagues are just behind you, you can talk to them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line742"><a name="pos742"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> I can, but they are helpful in that regard, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line743"><a name="pos743"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Very well.   And the aerial photographs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line744"><a name="pos744"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> The same.</p>
<p class="line" id="line745"><a name="pos745"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The same?</p>

<p class="line" id="line747"><a name="pos747"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We have the South African Defence Force here, so they will provide those particulars.   Yes, very well.   Yes, Mr Berger.</p>

<p class="line" id="line750"><a name="pos750"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR BERGER CONTINUES:</span> Mr Mthembu, I'm going to try and move as fast as possible, so please I'm asking you, listen to my questions and answer just my questions, if you would.</p>
<p class="line" id="line751"><a name="pos751"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Let me emphasise that, Mr Mthembu, that when the question is put to you, if you can answer the question with a yes or no, please do so, but more importantly, if you do not understand the questions, you've got to say so, so that the question can be repeated to you.   Do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line752"><a name="pos752"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, I do understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line753"><a name="pos753"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Mthembu, what political objective did you think you would achieve by killing all the residents of Boipatong as you planned to do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line754"><a name="pos754"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> As I have explained before, I did not have the opportunity to go to school, but I think that had I had the chance to go to school, I would have tried to come up with a solution so that the conflict between the two organisations is addressed, bring the leadership of the two organisations so we can resolve the matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line755"><a name="pos755"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Let me explain the question to you, in your application for amnesty, you've stated that the attack on Boipatong was politically motivated, do you understand that, in other words it was associated with politics, do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line756"><a name="pos756"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line757"><a name="pos757"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What Mr Berger wants to know is, he's directing this question to you specifically, what political objective did you hope to achieve by killing all the residents of Boipatong?   Do you understand the question now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line758"><a name="pos758"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, I do understand, but then I don't have an answer to that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line759"><a name="pos759"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> I'm sorry, Mr Chairperson, maybe if I can ask this question, Mr Mthembu has been repeating, saying he's not educated, if I may ask him what standard did he pass at school?</p>
<p class="line" id="line760"><a name="pos760"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Standard nine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line761"><a name="pos761"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line762"><a name="pos762"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Mthembu, you've told the Committee that there were no meetings prior to the one on the 17th of June at which the attack was discussed.   Isn't it correct that a week or two before the attack, the possibility of an attack on Boipatong was discussed at the Kwamadala Hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line763"><a name="pos763"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Mr Berger, I don't know that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line764"><a name="pos764"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You did not hear of any such meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line765"><a name="pos765"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line766"><a name="pos766"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> On the Sunday before the attack, there was a meeting of all the men of Kwamadala Hostel in the stadium, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line767"><a name="pos767"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I don't know whether I was present or not on that Sunday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line768"><a name="pos768"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Let me try and refresh your memory, Mr Themba Khosa addressed that meeting, do you remember it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line769"><a name="pos769"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No, I don't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line770"><a name="pos770"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And a certain Mr Dlamini also addressed that meeting.   This Mr Dlamini came from KwaZulu Natal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line771"><a name="pos771"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I don't know whether he was present at the meeting or not, I wouldn't say, because I may not have been present on that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line772"><a name="pos772"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> This Mr Dlamini was accompanied by a bodyguard called Gabelo, and this Mr Dlamini was sent to Kwamadala by a minister who lived in Durban.   Does any of this ring a bell?</p>
<p class="line" id="line773"><a name="pos773"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line774"><a name="pos774"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Do you remember the meeting now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line775"><a name="pos775"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I don't remember the meeting.   I am answering to the question about Mr Dlamini.</p>
<p class="line" id="line776"><a name="pos776"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well no, what he's put to you is that, firstly, Mr Dlamini was accompanied by a bodyguard by the name of Gabela or Gabelo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line777"><a name="pos777"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Gabelo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line778"><a name="pos778"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.   In addition, Mr Dlamini had been sent to Kwamadala Hostel by a minister who lived in Durban.   Do you know anything about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line779"><a name="pos779"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No, I don't know anything about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line780"><a name="pos780"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Sorry, Mr Chairman, you're referring to a minister, that could be a minister of the church or a minister in the Kwazulu government.   Could that be clarified?</p>
<p class="line" id="line781"><a name="pos781"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well the witness doesn't seem to have a difficulty... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line782"><a name="pos782"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The witness says he doesn't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line783"><a name="pos783"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> ...the witness doesn't seem to have difficulty with that description.   A minister from Durban, either a religious minister or a minister in the Kwazulu government, do you know of any such minister who would have sent Mr Dlamini to the Kwamadala Hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line784"><a name="pos784"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I know Mr Dlamini to have been an ambassador, so to speak, or a representative of the movement in Vereeniging, who was taking care of the needs of the IFP members in this area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line785"><a name="pos785"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And he was sent by a minister of the IFP from Durban?</p>
<p class="line" id="line786"><a name="pos786"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, that's how I know it to have been.</p>
<p class="line" id="line787"><a name="pos787"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He was sent by the minister of the IFP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line788"><a name="pos788"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line789"><a name="pos789"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you know that Mr Dlamini was there, having been sent by a minister of the IFP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line790"><a name="pos790"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I can explain, sir, that he was in the Vaal Triangle area, not that he was sent on that day to attend the meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line791"><a name="pos791"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You've told us that you know Mr Dlamini as the IFP representative in Vereeniging, but what's being put to you is that, all of this flows from the question of a meeting that was held on a Sunday a week just before the attack on Boipatong.   What is being put to you is that Dlamini was there, having been sent to Kwamadala Hostel by a minister of the IFP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line792"><a name="pos792"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, I do understand that, but there's nothing I can say about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line793"><a name="pos793"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Your evidence is that you do not recall such a meeting, you know nothing about it, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line794"><a name="pos794"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> It's been a long time, sir, I wish for you to understand that, and I therefore cannot remember so many things as to what was happening at what time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line795"><a name="pos795"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well let me refresh your memory please.   Have a look at page 8, paragraph 11</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line796"><a name="pos796"></a>"On the Sunday before the Boipatong massacre, Themba Khosa and Dlamini came to address a meeting of the people in the stadium.  Other residents of the Kwamadala Hostel were present.   Only the men of the Kwamadala Hostel were present.   Dlamini was accompanied by a member of the Kwazulu police, Gabelo, who was his bodyguard."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line797"><a name="pos797"></a>Do you remember now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line798"><a name="pos798"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Sir, as I have indicated to you that I am not in the position to remember everything that happened.   This may well mean that this is what happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line799"><a name="pos799"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But you now remember that on a Sunday before the Boipatong massacre, Themba Khosa and Dlamini came to address the people at the stadium?</p>
<p class="line" id="line800"><a name="pos800"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line801"><a name="pos801"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Mthembu, you were asked a question at page 20, paragraph 20.4, you were asked</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line802"><a name="pos802"></a>"  Who is Dlamini, who you allege was present during this meeting, and what is his position in the IFP?"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line803"><a name="pos803"></a>Your answer, at page 31, 20.4:-</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line804"><a name="pos804"></a>"He is an honourable man who was sent by a minister of the IFP from Durban to look after the members of the IFP in the Vaal Triangle as a whole."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line805"><a name="pos805"></a>This answer of yours was signed by you on the 3rd of June 1998.</p>
<p class="line" id="line806"><a name="pos806"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, I signed it, I have answered that question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line807"><a name="pos807"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You were also asked about a meeting, I'll give you the question, question 19</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line808"><a name="pos808"></a>"  You state that you were present at the general meeting held in the hostel approximately a week before the attack?"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line809"><a name="pos809"></a>You were asked:-</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line810"><a name="pos810"></a>"  Was Mr Themba Khosa present during this meeting?"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line811"><a name="pos811"></a>Your answer was:-</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line812"><a name="pos812"></a>"No."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line813"><a name="pos813"></a>You were then asked:-</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line814"><a name="pos814"></a>"  Did Mr Mbeki Sene Mkhize personally address and warn hostel dwellers during this meeting to be prepared because of the pending attack?"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line815"><a name="pos815"></a>Your answer is:-</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line816"><a name="pos816"></a>"Yes."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line817"><a name="pos817"></a>Now it seems as though there were two meetings, there was one meeting on the Sunday, which was addressed by Mr Themba Khosa, and there was one meeting held in the hostel approximately a week before the attack, where Mr Themba Khosa was not present, and which was addressed by Mr Mbeki Sene Mkhize, who warned hostel dwellers to be prepared because of a pending attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line818"><a name="pos818"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Mr Berger, now I have just indicated to you this happened a long time ago, the meeting that was held, I want to say the meeting was held at that time because there was going to be an attack.   There used to be meetings and Themba Khosa used to come to address people if something was going to take place wherever, he would come to inform us about those meetings pertaining to the organisation.    He did not necessarily come to the meeting that day because there was to be an attack on Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line819"><a name="pos819"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Mthembu, is it your evidence that there were two meetings, one that was addressed by Mr Mkhize approximately a week before the attack, and one that was addressed by Mr Themba Khoza on the Sunday preceding the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line820"><a name="pos820"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Maybe you were told about these, sir, but I will tell you that the meeting that was attended by Mkhize was the one held on the 17th of June 1992, not that the meeting held on Sunday was with an intention of explaining to us what we should do, as you have just explained it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line821"><a name="pos821"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, as far as you can recall, there was a meeting on a Sunday preceding the attack on Boipatong, which was addressed by Themba Khosa, and there was no other meeting after that, other than the one on the evening of the 17th of June 1992?</p>
<p class="line" id="line822"><a name="pos822"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> That's what I've just explained, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line823"><a name="pos823"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Which minister had sent Mr Dlamini to the Vaal?  Sorry, that wasn't interpreted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line824"><a name="pos824"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I'm not in the position to say he was sent by the executive committee from Durban.</p>
<p class="line" id="line825"><a name="pos825"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The executive committee of the IFP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line826"><a name="pos826"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, that is correct, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line827"><a name="pos827"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You assumed that that was the position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line828"><a name="pos828"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes sir, that was my assumption because I too did not know Mr Dlamini and when he arrived he was introduced to us in one of the meetings where it was indicated that he is coming from Durban.   I would say... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line829"><a name="pos829"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Let's put it this way, you see on a Sunday when Dlamini came, was that the first time he was coming to Kwamadala Hostel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line830"><a name="pos830"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No sir, as I have explained that it was not for the first time that he came, and the meeting was not necessarily held because it was Sunday, now he used to frequent the hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line831"><a name="pos831"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> When Dlamini was first introduced to you at one of the earlier meetings, he was introduced as somebody who had been sent by a minister of the IFP in Durban, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line832"><a name="pos832"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> When I first heard about Mr Dlamini, that was just before we went to a meeting in Zone 7 in 1990.</p>
<p class="line" id="line833"><a name="pos833"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> My question is, he was introduced as somebody who had come from Durban, having been sent from Durban by an IFP minister, is that how he was introduced to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line834"><a name="pos834"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line835"><a name="pos835"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Now let's move, if we can, quickly to the meeting on the Sunday.   Both Mr Dlamini and Mr Themba Khosa addressed this meeting, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line836"><a name="pos836"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Even though I cannot remember, but really they had come to the meeting with a purpose.</p>
<p class="line" id="line837"><a name="pos837"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> But you cannot remember the purpose?</p>
<p class="line" id="line838"><a name="pos838"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No, I don't remember, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line839"><a name="pos839"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I suggest to you, Mr Mthembu, that you are being selective again in your memory.   You have been through the documents, your affidavits, recently with your advocate and there are certain things here, I'll take you, for example, to paragraph 12, page 8, where you deal with the role of Mr Dlamini.   You say there that he said</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line840"><a name="pos840"></a>"There was a meeting because our people were dying.  They were being killed by the ANC people and Umkhonto we Sizwe.  Dlamini said this problem must be reported to Buthelezi."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line841"><a name="pos841"></a>You don't remember any of this, Mr Mthembu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line842"><a name="pos842"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Mr Berger, I have just explained to you, I am not in the position to remember everything, it's been six years now since this thing happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line843"><a name="pos843"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> It's less than two years since you wrote these words, Mr Mthembu.   How is it that you have forgotten anything about this meeting?   Is it perhaps because it was at this meeting that the attack on Boipatong was discussed by Mr Themba Khosa and Mr Dlamini?</p>
<p class="line" id="line844"><a name="pos844"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Mr Berger, if there was something that I knew, I would tell you, I would not hold it back, and I've just indicated to you that I cannot remember certain things, how then do you expect me to change, I just cannot bring my memory back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line845"><a name="pos845"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mthembu, Mr Dlamini was the representative of the IFP in Vereeniging?</p>
<p class="line" id="line846"><a name="pos846"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, that is correct, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line847"><a name="pos847"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now if the IFP members in Vereeniging had any problems, would he be the person that these problems would be reported to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line848"><a name="pos848"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, that is correct, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line849"><a name="pos849"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I see.   Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line850"><a name="pos850"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> When Dlamini says that the problem must be reported to Buthelezi, page 8, paragraph 12 of your affidavit, which Buthelezi was he referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line851"><a name="pos851"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> How many Buthelezis do you know, Mr Berger, because here they were talking about the IFP minister, Mr Mangesoto Buthelezi, really I don't know which Buthelezi you want me to talk about now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line852"><a name="pos852"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well, amongst two of your applicants there are two people named Buthelezi, that's why I asked the question, but you've clarified it now that the Buthelezi referred to in paragraph 12 is Minister Mangesoto Buthelezi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line853"><a name="pos853"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I would tell you that, I would tell you that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line854"><a name="pos854"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So would it be correct then to say, Mr Mthembu, that the problems of the hostel residents in Kwamadala were known through the ranks of the IFP all the way up to Minister Mangesoto Buthelezi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line855"><a name="pos855"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Would you please repeat, I did not get the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line856"><a name="pos856"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Would it be correct to say that the problems of the IFP members in Kwamadala hostel were known through the ranks of the IFP all the way up to Minister Mangesoto Buthelezi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line857"><a name="pos857"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Mr Berger, I wouldn't know that, I wouldn't know whether they knew or not, but what I know is that Mr Dlamini was the IFP representative in the Vaal Triangle, I think he is the person who is most suitable to answer that question as to how many people knew and how many people did not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line858"><a name="pos858"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Where is Mr Dlamini today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line859"><a name="pos859"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> You are asking a wrong person, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line860"><a name="pos860"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Themba Khosa also addressed that meeting on the Sunday.   You say in paragraph 13 on page 9</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line861"><a name="pos861"></a>"He was also angry at the killing of his people and said if the people came and attack you, you are supposed to fight back and kill them."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line862"><a name="pos862"></a>Do you remember that, Mr Mthembu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line863"><a name="pos863"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Sir, I've just explained to you that I don't remember certain things, I cannot say I remember things, whereas I don't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line864"><a name="pos864"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Mthembu, is it your evidence that you have no recollection whatsoever of this meeting at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line865"><a name="pos865"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you referring to the meeting of... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line866"><a name="pos866"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The meeting on the Sunday, which was addressed by Mr Themba Khosa and Mr Dlamini, is it your evidence that you cannot recall anything about this meeting whatsoever?</p>
<p class="line" id="line867"><a name="pos867"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I think you don't understand, sir... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line868"><a name="pos868"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In your affidavit, you refer to a meeting that was held on a Sunday just before the attack, the meeting which was addressed by Mr Themba Khosa and Mr Dlamini.</p>
<p class="line" id="line869"><a name="pos869"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, that is correct, but then I've just explained to Mr Berger that I don't know what they discussed, and therefore I'm not in the position to say what they said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line870"><a name="pos870"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, but you do recall that such a meeting did take place, what you cannot recall is what was said at that meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line871"><a name="pos871"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, that is correct, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line872"><a name="pos872"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So you remember Mr Themba Khosa coming to the meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line873"><a name="pos873"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Mr Berger, I do remember Mr Khosa attending the meeting.   I have just explained that Mr Khosa was not coming there for the first time, he used to come.</p>
<p class="line" id="line874"><a name="pos874"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So then if the attack was discussed at that meeting, you would not remember it, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line875"><a name="pos875"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I would tell you if the attack was discussed at the meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line876"><a name="pos876"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you are telling me that the attack was not discussed at that meeting, of that you are sure?</p>
<p class="line" id="line877"><a name="pos877"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Mr Berger, I am saying to you I do not remember what was said at the meeting, that's all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line878"><a name="pos878"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Surely, Mr Mthembu, if there was going to be an attack on Boipatong on the Wednesday, it would have been discussed with IFP leaders on the Sunday?</p>
<p class="line" id="line879"><a name="pos879"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> That's what you say, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line880"><a name="pos880"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you cannot say if it was discussed or if it wasn't discussed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line881"><a name="pos881"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> You are the one telling me, what should I say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line882"><a name="pos882"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That doesn't help us, Mr Mthembu.   If you agree with him, say so, if you do not agree with him, say so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line883"><a name="pos883"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I don't agree with what he is saying, he is just reading from the paper and speak to me as well as he wish, I don't agree with what he is saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line884"><a name="pos884"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Mr Mthembu, you say you don't agree with him, why don't you agree with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line885"><a name="pos885"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I do not agree with him because I have just said I don't remember what was said at the meeting, that is why I don't agree with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line886"><a name="pos886"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> So surely if you don't remember what was said, you can't agree or disagree with him, isn't that fair?   You can't remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line887"><a name="pos887"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line888"><a name="pos888"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line889"><a name="pos889"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So it's possible, Mr Mthembu, that an attack on Boipatong was discussed that Sunday with Mr Themba Khosa and Mr Dlamini, is it not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line890"><a name="pos890"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I have no knowledge of that, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line891"><a name="pos891"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I take it that you also won't be able to say what Mr Themba Khosa meant when he said you are supposed to fight back and kill them?   All right, you can't answer that one.   Let me ask you this, surely if there was going to be an attack on Boipatong, you, as an IFP leader, when you heard it on that Wednesday night, would have realised this could have terrible consequences, or it could have great consequences, this attack on Boipatong, did you realise that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line892"><a name="pos892"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You're referring to the 17th?</p>
<p class="line" id="line893"><a name="pos893"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> To the 17th, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line894"><a name="pos894"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I would not have known at the time, sir, because it might as well happen that I too was angry at the time, I would not have known what consequences there would be, bad or good.</p>
<p class="line" id="line895"><a name="pos895"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did it not occur to you, as a leader of the IFP, on that Wednesday night, to discuss with your other leaders whether or not this has the blessing of the senior structures of the IFP, for example the provincial structures or the national structures of the IFP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line896"><a name="pos896"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Mr Berger, if a meeting is called here at the time during which the meeting was called, I think you too would not have had an opportunity to go and discuss with your colleagues with the discussions about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line897"><a name="pos897"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So are you saying that, even if you wanted to discuss this with your colleagues, you would not have had the opportunity to do so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line898"><a name="pos898"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, that's what I am explaining.</p>
<p class="line" id="line899"><a name="pos899"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Were you forced into the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line900"><a name="pos900"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I cannot say if there was force used, I was not forced.</p>
<p class="line" id="line901"><a name="pos901"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Page 37, paragraph 5, you say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line902"><a name="pos902"></a>"After a few minutes, Mr Quanqua told all of us at the meeting to go and fetch our traditional weapons.   We did as he told us because there was no-one amongst us who could disagree with him.   All of us were afraid of him."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line903"><a name="pos903"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> What do you want me to say to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line904"><a name="pos904"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you go on the attack because you were afraid of the consequences which would come to you if you refused to go on the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line905"><a name="pos905"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Mr Berger, as I have explained that I was not forced, I think that is the most appropriate answer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line906"><a name="pos906"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> When then do you say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line907"><a name="pos907"></a>"We did as he told us because there was no-one amongst us who could disagree with him, all of us were afraid of him."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line908"><a name="pos908"></a>Are you not saying here that if you were not afraid of him, you would have disagreed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line909"><a name="pos909"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Mr Berger, how would I have disagreed with him, because he is my elder and our people were being tortured and harassed at Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line910"><a name="pos910"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Mthembu, what then did you mean by the two sentences</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line911"><a name="pos911"></a>"We did as he told us because there was no-one amongst us who could disagree with him.  All of us were afraid of him"?</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line912"><a name="pos912"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I think you are asking this for the third time and I still have just one response to the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line913"><a name="pos913"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> So your answer is, you were not afraid of Mr Quanqua?</p>
<p class="line" id="line914"><a name="pos914"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Sir, you must realise that being afraid of a person and respecting him are two very different things.</p>
<p class="line" id="line915"><a name="pos915"></a>I should have listened to him, because he was my elder.  I regarded him as a respected person because he was my elder.  When he said something, I should have listened to him because he was my elder.  I think that when Mr Berger's father talks to him, he listens, because he is older than he is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line916"><a name="pos916"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Mthembu, my difficulty is what you say at page 37, paragraph 5.   Am I to understand your evidence that you were not afraid of Mr Quanqua?</p>
<p class="line" id="line917"><a name="pos917"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I was not afraid of him, but I respected him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line918"><a name="pos918"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You were not afraid of the men from Umsinga either?</p>
<p class="line" id="line919"><a name="pos919"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I was afraid of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line920"><a name="pos920"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And they were part of this attack on Boipatong, were they not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line921"><a name="pos921"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line922"><a name="pos922"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And if you were not a part of this attack, were you not then risking yourself that the men from Umsinga might take action against you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line923"><a name="pos923"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> If they were to take action, they would be doing what they thought was best.</p>
<p class="line" id="line924"><a name="pos924"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Let me ask you this question, did you go on the attack because you were afraid of the men from Umsinga?</p>
<p class="line" id="line925"><a name="pos925"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I went because our people were being killed in Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line926"><a name="pos926"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Not because you were afraid of the men from Umsinga?</p>
<p class="line" id="line927"><a name="pos927"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line928"><a name="pos928"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Is it correct that Iscor is a factory that works 24 hours a day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line929"><a name="pos929"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I don't know about that, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line930"><a name="pos930"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I'm sorry I didn't get the full interpretation of what the witness said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line931"><a name="pos931"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The witness said he would not know about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line932"><a name="pos932"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Let me read certain things to you.   Your lawyers at the criminal trial made certain submissions on your behalf.   At page 78 of their heads of argument, they say that</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line933"><a name="pos933"></a>"Iscor is a factory which works 24 hours a day."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line934"><a name="pos934"></a>You, as an employee of Iscor, would have known that, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line935"><a name="pos935"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> As I was working at Iscor, I knew of only my working hours of my shift.   I was concentrated on what I was responsible for or what I did, not the entire company, as such.</p>
<p class="line" id="line936"><a name="pos936"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The tarred road in front of the hostel is used 24 hours a day and it is lit, there are lights there at night.   Can you confirm that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line937"><a name="pos937"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I don't know which road you are referring to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line938"><a name="pos938"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The very road that you took to Boipatong.   You said you came out of the front of the hostel, you walked along that road, under a bridge, to Boipatong.   That road is used 24 hours a day and it is lit at night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line939"><a name="pos939"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I hear what you're saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line940"><a name="pos940"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> There are security personnel who patrol the area on a 24 hour basis, and the Vaal Commando also patrols the area, that's the army, and they, the words used here are "begelei skofte", they transport or accompany, accompany shifts who are coming off from work to and from the hostel, in other words there's constant activity, the Vaal Commando is there, the security personnel from Iscor are there, you can't dispute any of that, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line941"><a name="pos941"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I will not dispute it.   That is what you are telling me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line942"><a name="pos942"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Now, I want to read to you what was said at 79 on your behalf.   It was submitted, and perhaps I should read the Afrikaans</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line943"><a name="pos943"></a>"Dit word respekvol gesubmiteer dat dit uiters onwaarskynlik is dat hierdie roete..."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line944"><a name="pos944"></a>this is the route in front of the hostel, or out of the main gate:-</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line945"><a name="pos945"></a>"...gevolg sou gewees het deur die aanvallers.  Veel eerder sou 'n klandestiene roete wat deur die agterkant van die hostel kon gelei het gevolg gewees het of daar sou by 'n voorafgereelde plek byeengekom gewees het."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line946"><a name="pos946"></a>Now, according to you, you didn't go out the back of the hostel, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line947"><a name="pos947"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No, we used the main gate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line948"><a name="pos948"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you didn't come together at a pre-planned place either?</p>
<p class="line" id="line949"><a name="pos949"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I do not have knowledge about that, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line950"><a name="pos950"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> The submissions go on to say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line951"><a name="pos951"></a>"Verder sou veel eerder gebruik gemaak gewees het van voertuie wat aanvallers aan die agterkant van Slovo Park kon aflaai."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line952"><a name="pos952"></a>In other words, more probably vehicles were used to transport the attackers to the back of Slovo Park?</p>
<p class="line" id="line953"><a name="pos953"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I have no knowledge of that, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line954"><a name="pos954"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Now you see, my questions come down to this, you are not telling the truth when you say that police vehicles were not used to transport some of the attackers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line955"><a name="pos955"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> If that is the case, sir, do you mean that since I did not see a police vehicle nor being in one, it must be different people who were attacking that area, not us, is that what you mean?</p>
<p class="line" id="line956"><a name="pos956"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What he is putting to you and what you must answer is that he's saying you are not telling the truth when you say that police motor vehicles were not used to transport the attackers.   What do you say to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line957"><a name="pos957"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I say I have no knowledge of that, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line958"><a name="pos958"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you are not telling the truth when you say that the police, the defence force, and I'm going to add as well, as though you haven't said it, Iscor, were not aware of the fact that the attackers were moving from the hostel towards Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line959"><a name="pos959"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I have no comment on that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line960"><a name="pos960"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well, let's take Iscor.   On your number 330 heavily armed men with pangas and axes and AK-47's, come out of the main gate of Kwamadala Hostel and move in the direction of Boipatong, and they go directly past a 24 hour security, Iscor security, are you saying that you could not have been seen, or perhaps the security might have missed you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line961"><a name="pos961"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> With regards to that, sir, I think you may not know where the main gate is at Kwamadala and where the security force gates or their offices are.</p>
<p class="line" id="line962"><a name="pos962"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You see, Mr Mthembu, it was argued on your behalf at the trial that the attackers could not have come out of the main gate, because if they had done so, they would have been seen by the security personnel, by the Vaal Commando, by any number of security forces, that's what was argued on your behalf.</p>
<p class="line" id="line963"><a name="pos963"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, Mr Mthembu, having regard to the route that you say you used on the day in question, did you go past Iscor security?</p>
<p class="line" id="line964"><a name="pos964"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> When we exited through the main gate, or when we exit through the gate, we did not pass the security guards from Iscor.   I can see that the honourable sir doesn't know what he is talking about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line965"><a name="pos965"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> At the trial it was argued on your behalf that you could not have passed in front of the Iscor security without them noticing you, is that what was sub... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line966"><a name="pos966"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Can I clarify something here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line967"><a name="pos967"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...what was submitted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line968"><a name="pos968"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Not only that, and also moved along the road, which was patrolled on a 24 hour basis by Iscor security, Vaal Commando and so on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line969"><a name="pos969"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ja.   That is what was put on your behalf.  Do you agree with what was put on your behalf?</p>
<p class="line" id="line970"><a name="pos970"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Because this pertained to the trial, I think the lawyers who were defending us were trying to set us free, I cannot say that I used a route if I did not use it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line971"><a name="pos971"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> From that main gate, the Kwamadala main gate, to Iscor is about 300 metres, am I correct?   And you would pass Iscor on your way to Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line972"><a name="pos972"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Can I just intervene here, I just want to set something correctly?   I think if we get the photographs, the position will be made clear.   If one leaves through the main gate, you get to the tar road, and about 300 metres back on that tar road, away from Kwamadala, you get the security gates, so you don't really pass the security gates.  What was argued as a probability during the course of the trial was that there was activity on a 24 hour basis and it's highly improbable that if a group of 300 people moved along that tar road, that they would not have been seen, that was the argument during the trial.</p>
<p class="line" id="line973"><a name="pos973"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, that's what I understood to be the argument, yes, it was put no higher than the probabilities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line974"><a name="pos974"></a><span class="speaker">MR STRYDOM:</span> Yes, it's only on a probability basis, because our instructions were that Mr Mthembu, for instance, was not part of the attack, so we just argued on probabilities at that stage, and I can also mention these probabilities were rejected by the trial judge because the accused at that trial were convicted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line975"><a name="pos975"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well one can't, with respect, have one's cake and eat it.   What was submitted, and on the basis of evidence, was that it was "uiters onwaarskynlik", that it was not just improbable, that it was highly, highly improbable, that a group of 300 attackers would not be picked up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line976"><a name="pos976"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But the difficulty that we have here is that we don't have the benefit of that argument, I mean of the evidence that was before the trial court, on the basis of which those submissions were made, so we are not in a position to comment on the probability or otherwise of whatever submission was made, you know, at the trial, but I understand the point that you're making.</p>
<p class="line" id="line977"><a name="pos977"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well perhaps, Chairperson, we'll get those facts agreed and placed before the Committee in due course.</p>
<p class="line" id="line978"><a name="pos978"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It does seem, Mr Strydom is nodding his head, which I think is the proper way to deal with the issue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line979"><a name="pos979"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Whether or not you would have been picked up or discovered, there was always the risk, I put it to you, of discovery by either Iscor, the Vaal Commando, the police, someone else, and what I want to ask you is, how could you, as one of the attackers, have followed such a blatant route, such an open route, without fearing that you would be discovered by one or other of the security forces?   Do you understand my question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line980"><a name="pos980"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, I understand the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line981"><a name="pos981"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And what is your answer, how could you have done that without fearing that you would be picked up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line982"><a name="pos982"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> At that time, whether we were going to be caught or not did not matter.   After we had decided that we were going some place, we would go.   If the police discovered us, that would be their duty to do so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line983"><a name="pos983"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Isn't it rather, Mr Mthembu, that you knew in advance that you were not going to be arrested by the police or the army or Iscor, you knew in advance that you had safe passage to Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line984"><a name="pos984"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I had no knowledge of that, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line985"><a name="pos985"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You know the little bridge that one crosses to enter Boipatong in Umzumvubu Street, do you know that little bridge?</p>
<p class="line" id="line986"><a name="pos986"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, I know it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line987"><a name="pos987"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did you cross it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line988"><a name="pos988"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line989"><a name="pos989"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Do you know, if you're looking at Boipatong standing on that little bridge, one has to go, you have to go another 900 metres south, and then a further 900 metres west, I beg your pardon, east, to get to Lekwa Street, in other words it's almost two kilometres from that footbridge to get to Lekwa Street to enter into the township.   What I'm putting to you is that to get people at the footbridge entering into Umzumvubu, to get people at Lekwa Street entering into the township, to get people right up at the top near Slovo Park into the township, and to co-ordinate all of that so that the attack starts at the same time, you need planning and you need vehicles, that's what I'm putting to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line990"><a name="pos990"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Mr Berger, I do not understand your question clearly.   What I think has happened is this, people have told you about this and you don't know about it yourself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line991"><a name="pos991"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well in short what is being put to you is that to get to the point of the attack, you had, two things had to have occurred:  one, there had to be prior planning;  and secondly, you had to be transported to that point.   Is that in a sense what you... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line992"><a name="pos992"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line993"><a name="pos993"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I think Mr Berger doesn't understand when I say that I, as a person who was there, did not use any transport to get there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line994"><a name="pos994"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What I'm putting to you is that transport was used to carry some of the attackers... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line995"><a name="pos995"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Berger, do you think we can take it further than this, because he is clearly saying he didn't use the transport.</p>
<p class="line" id="line996"><a name="pos996"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, he might not have used the transport, but he would have seen the transport.   The point that I'm making is that for this attack to have occurred... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line997"><a name="pos997"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We understand the question.   Did you see anyone being transported by motor vehicle from the hostel to Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line998"><a name="pos998"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Sir, I did not see anybody being transported to Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line999"><a name="pos999"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> At page 82 of the heads of argument, it was submitted by your lawyers on your behalf that there were army vehicles at the robot at the crossing of Frikkie Meyer Boulevard and Nobel Boulevard, that's the northern entrance to Boipatong.   It is then submitted on your behalf that if any, and the word "enige" is underlined, if any of the attackers had made use of that road, that tarred road, to go in the direction of Kwamadala, then they must have been seen at least by members of the army.   It's your evidence that when you were going back to Kwamadala, you were seen by the army and the police, and none of them attempted to stop you, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1000"><a name="pos1000"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> We saw police and army vehicles, but they did not stop us.   We were using that small bridge you have been referring to and they were at the robots near the garage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1001"><a name="pos1001"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you see them on your way to Boipatong or was that on your way from Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1002"><a name="pos1002"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> On the way back from Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1003"><a name="pos1003"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Let me also tell you that there was evidence at the criminal trial that people had gathered in the veld behind the hostel and that that grass had been pushed flat.  Do you know anything about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1004"><a name="pos1004"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> What was discussed in the trial and what we are talking about now are two very different things.   The lawyers who represented us may not be here and I don't know if you expect me to go summon them and explain what they were saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1005"><a name="pos1005"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mthembu, you said that you were, as I recall, in Boipatong for approximately, what did you say, 30 minutes to an hour?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1006"><a name="pos1006"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1007"><a name="pos1007"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And that on your way back, it was there, well probably, when you were in Boipatong and on your way back it was only then that you saw the police, the Casspirs I think you said, here near the robots?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1008"><a name="pos1008"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1009"><a name="pos1009"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, and does that include the army as well?  Was it the army and the police, or just uniformed officers, it could have been the army or the... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1010"><a name="pos1010"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> It was police vehicles, I may not know what uniform they had on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1011"><a name="pos1011"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Could it be possible that the army, the police that you saw there, were already there when you went into Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1012"><a name="pos1012"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I will not explain whether they were there or not, because maybe I would have seen them if they were there, I would not know whether they were there or not, I cannot make a fair comment on that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1013"><a name="pos1013"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But when you went to Boipatong, there were no police in the vicinity where you later saw them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1014"><a name="pos1014"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No, sir, there were not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1015"><a name="pos1015"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You only saw them at that spot on your way back?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1016"><a name="pos1016"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, on our return.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1017"><a name="pos1017"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Mr Mthembu, did you use the small bridge twice, on the way in and on the way out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1018"><a name="pos1018"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> We used it twice, on our way there and on our return from Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1019"><a name="pos1019"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You saw them from the bridge on your way out you said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1020"><a name="pos1020"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1021"><a name="pos1021"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You probably weren't looking for them on your way in, because you would have been going in the other direction?   I'm just trying to understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1022"><a name="pos1022"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> As I've explained earlier, it is possible that they may have been there when we went into Boipatong, or they may not have been there, but I did not see them, because I was concentrating on where we were going.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1023"><a name="pos1023"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> That's what I was trying to understand, is why it was likely you might not have seen them, you were looking in a different direction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1024"><a name="pos1024"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, it is possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1025"><a name="pos1025"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Thanks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1026"><a name="pos1026"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> On the Sunday, well before I get to the Sunday, for the 30 minutes to an hour that you were in Boipatong, I take it there was a lot of screaming, shouting, sounds of gunfire, going on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1027"><a name="pos1027"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1028"><a name="pos1028"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And all you did for 30 minutes to an hour was, you stabbed one person and you hit one person with a knopkierie?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1029"><a name="pos1029"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1030"><a name="pos1030"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> On the Sunday, I beg your pardon, on the Friday, the 19th of June 1992, there was another meeting at the hostel, which was addressed by Mr Themba Khosa, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1031"><a name="pos1031"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1032"><a name="pos1032"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Was Mr Humphrey Ndlovo also present at that meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1033"><a name="pos1033"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I do not remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1034"><a name="pos1034"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Who else was present with Mr Themba Khosa at that meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1035"><a name="pos1035"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I don't remember, sir, because Themba Khosa used to come to Kwamadala either with Mr Humphrey Ndlovo or just by himself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1036"><a name="pos1036"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> On that day he came with a senior police officer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1037"><a name="pos1037"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes sir, because the police had already surrounded Kwamadala, there were police officers near the main gate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1038"><a name="pos1038"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Was there an attorney with Mr Themba Khosa, a woman, a white woman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1039"><a name="pos1039"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I don't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1040"><a name="pos1040"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> At that meeting, Mr Khosa addressed all the residents of Kwamadala and told them to burn all the stolen property, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1041"><a name="pos1041"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1042"><a name="pos1042"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You remember this meeting, but you don't remember the meeting less than a week before, in fact five days before, where Mr Themba Khosa said if people come to attack you, then you must kill them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1043"><a name="pos1043"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I think I answered that question, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1044"><a name="pos1044"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Khosa said you must burn the stolen property because it could be evidence to the police if the people of Boipatong come and show them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1045"><a name="pos1045"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I'm listening, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1046"><a name="pos1046"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1047"><a name="pos1047"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1048"><a name="pos1048"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Is it also correct that Mr Themba Khosa said that we must hide all those weapons and spears, together with the clothes which had blood on them, in order to stop the police from gathering their evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1049"><a name="pos1049"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Sir, I agree with you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1050"><a name="pos1050"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And then Mr Khosa told you to co-operate with the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1051"><a name="pos1051"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1052"><a name="pos1052"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And by that he meant tell the police lies?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1053"><a name="pos1053"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Mr Chairperson, I do not think that this applicant can tell the Committee what Mr Themba Khosa meant by those words.   He can tell the Committee what he understood by them, but I can't see that he can tell the Committee what Mr Themba Khosa meant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1054"><a name="pos1054"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I'll ask it that way then.   When Mr Themba Khosa said you must co-operate with the police after you've destroyed all the evidence, you understood Mr Khosa to mean that you must tell the police lies?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1055"><a name="pos1055"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Mr Berger, with reference to what you're saying, I think that when Mr Khosa said what he said at the meeting, he did not direct us as to what we should do step by step, he did not direct us as to what we should do first or do second and then do whatever last.   The police were there, they surrounded the area, we could not go out to the shops to buy food, how could we then let police in, into Kwamadala Hostel?   Themba Khosa told us that we should remain calm and co-operate with the police and listen to what they had to say and let them search if they wanted to search the place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1056"><a name="pos1056"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> But he also told you to hide all the weapons and spears from the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1057"><a name="pos1057"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I don't know how you want me to put this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1058"><a name="pos1058"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Did Mr Themba Khosa tell you to hide all the spears and the weapons from the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1059"><a name="pos1059"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> He did tell us to do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1060"><a name="pos1060"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> He also told you to hide the clothes with blood so that the police could not gather evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1061"><a name="pos1061"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I don't know what you want me to say, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1062"><a name="pos1062"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Just confirm that please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1063"><a name="pos1063"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I had already told you, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1064"><a name="pos1064"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> How did Mr Themba Khosa know that all of this stuff had come from Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1065"><a name="pos1065"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I think you are asking the wrong person, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1066"><a name="pos1066"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Was it discussed at that meeting on the Friday that "we were responsible for the attack on Boipatong, we have stolen, we have killed", was Mr Themba Khosa advised of it at that meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1067"><a name="pos1067"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I did not hear about that at the meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1068"><a name="pos1068"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Then, is it correct that all the property that was stolen from Boipatong, as well as the bloody clothes, were burnt to ashes in the hostel, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1069"><a name="pos1069"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1070"><a name="pos1070"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And this was done while the police were outside?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1071"><a name="pos1071"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, there were police outside the main gate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1072"><a name="pos1072"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Was this also done on the Friday, the very day of the meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1073"><a name="pos1073"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I don't know, I don't remember what day it was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1074"><a name="pos1074"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Well, Mr Khosa gives an instruction on the Friday, the hostel was searched by the police shortly after that, is it correct that between the giving of the order and the search of the hostel, that all the stolen goods, as well as the bloodied clothes, were burnt?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1075"><a name="pos1075"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Mr Berger, I think that on a Thursday after the attack on Boipatong, police arrived in large numbers, they searched the place and confiscated even traditional weapons for testing, ballistic tests, to see if they were not connected to the attack in Boipatong.   What I am trying to explain is that the police would come to the hostel even before Themba Khosa arrived there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1076"><a name="pos1076"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Were the TV sets and stoves also burnt in this fire, to ashes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1077"><a name="pos1077"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Those were the things that were being burnt in that fire.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1078"><a name="pos1078"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And the weapons that were confiscated by the police were all thrown into one pile and taken away, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1079"><a name="pos1079"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> The police confiscated weapons that they found inside the hostel and they said they are taking these for ballistic testing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1080"><a name="pos1080"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Who was Mr Themba Khosa to give an order that the stolen property and the bloodied clothes be burnt, how come he had the authority to give such an order?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1081"><a name="pos1081"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> He is also a member of the IFP, and he is an elder, so people should listen to him when he speaks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1082"><a name="pos1082"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Is that when he gave that order, it was an order from the leader of the Youth Brigade in the province, and that's why it was carried out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1083"><a name="pos1083"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> That is also possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1084"><a name="pos1084"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> And you knew that at the time, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1085"><a name="pos1085"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I did not know it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1086"><a name="pos1086"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Mr Mthembu, it's not a requirement for amnesty, but you were led on this right at the beginning of your evidence, you said, well through your counsel you said that you were sorry.   Now, at page 41, paragraph 15, you say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1087"><a name="pos1087"></a>"To conclude my statement, I would like to say to the community of Boipatong and to the residents who lost their loved ones, I am very sorry and I am asking them to forgive me because today I am behind bars and I realise what a dreadful thing we did that night."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1088"><a name="pos1088"></a>Are you sorry because you are behind bars, Mr Mthembu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1089"><a name="pos1089"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Sir, I explained this earlier on, that I am sorry, not just because I am behind bars, but even if I was free, had I had such an opportunity I would have come before this Committee and said the same thing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1090"><a name="pos1090"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Why did it take you so long to say that you were sorry?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1091"><a name="pos1091"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> As a convicted person, I cannot just go to the TRC or Mr Tutu, Bishop Tutu, and say that I am seeking amnesty for the people that I killed.   I have to follow certain procedures, like acquiring legal representation and so forth, to be able to apply for amnesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1092"><a name="pos1092"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> You see, Mr Mthembu, I want to put it to you that the only reason you are sorry is because you've been convicted, isn't that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1093"><a name="pos1093"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> No, it is not the truth.   Why are my co-accused who are not in prison also here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1094"><a name="pos1094"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> All of your co-accused who were convicted are the ones applying for amnesty.   Those who were not convicted, or who were never caught, are not saying that they're sorry, they haven't come forward, and isn't that where you would be... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1095"><a name="pos1095"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Sorry, Mr Chairman, again to interrupt, is this getting us anywhere, because we know that remorse is not a requirement in terms of the Act, so it doesn't really take it further, with respect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1096"><a name="pos1096"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Perhaps Mr Berger can tell us why it is relevant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1097"><a name="pos1097"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, I'm asking these questions because my clients have asked me to ask these questions, and if I... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1098"><a name="pos1098"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But is it relevant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1099"><a name="pos1099"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I prefaced it by saying that it's not a requirement, but if I can then, on a point of relevance, say, Mr Mthembu, if you are truly sorry for what you've done, would you be prepared to sit down with your co-accused and compile a list of the names and present whereabouts, if known, or if the names only, then that will also do, of the 300 people who participated in the attack on Boipatong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1100"><a name="pos1100"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I don't know how to respond to that, sir, because we do not see each other often, I am in one place, they are at another.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1101"><a name="pos1101"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> I'm inviting you, during the lunch breaks, and on your own and then to come together to compile a list of all the people, the 300 and more people who were involved in that attack on Boipatong, and the reason I'm inviting you to do this is because I've been instructed to tell you, on behalf of the victims, that they will not begin to consider forgiving you until you tell the whole truth, and the whole truth includes the names of all the people involved in the attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1102"><a name="pos1102"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I understand that you are inviting me, but what I and my co-accused think may be different, and we are not in one area, we do not see each other often, even during the lunch breaks we must do other things, like eating.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1103"><a name="pos1103"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> During the lunch breaks, and this has been my last comment to you, Mr Mthembu, during the lunch breaks, you and your co-applicants can get together, if you are truly sorry, and put together a list of all of the people who were involved.   After all, it's a requirement for amnesty that you do so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1104"><a name="pos1104"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I understand what you're saying.   In other words, you are telling me that I and my co-accused are not here to seek forgiveness, you only realise that we are here to seek forgiveness only when you invite us to do what you have suggested.   Is that what you are trying to tell me, Mr Berger?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1105"><a name="pos1105"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> What I am trying to tell you, Mr Mthembu, is that you have not told the truth about what happened on that night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1106"><a name="pos1106"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> If that is the case, Mr Berger, you are saying this, I hear it from you, you must have knowledge about this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1107"><a name="pos1107"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mthembu, listen carefully to the question.   What Mr Berger is saying to you is that you've not been telling the truth to this Committee.   What do you say to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1108"><a name="pos1108"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Sir, as I am here, I am here to tell the truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1109"><a name="pos1109"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, I see that I have overrun my mandate by eight minutes.   I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1110"><a name="pos1110"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you, Mr Berger.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1111"><a name="pos1111"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR BERGER</p>
<p class="line" id="line1112"><a name="pos1112"></a><span class="speaker">MR BERGER:</span> Chairperson, can I also place on record that, because Miss Cambanis does not have a microphone, she says that she has no questions at this stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1113"><a name="pos1113"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That is not a problem, you can swop seats, you can go back to where she's sitting and then she can come forward.   Very well, yes Miss Cambanis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1114"><a name="pos1114"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> Thank you, Chairperson, I confirm that I have no questions at this stage for this applicant.   Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1115"><a name="pos1115"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, could you, what is the stage you're talking about, madam?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1116"><a name="pos1116"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> Sir, I didn't, I didn't ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1117"><a name="pos1117"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well the witness is here, so what we're saying, if you have a question, you've got to put them now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1118"><a name="pos1118"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> Chairperson, I do not have questions, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1119"><a name="pos1119"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay, excepting of course that you're putting a rider that if there is anything which arises from what the Committee might have to put to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1120"><a name="pos1120"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1121"><a name="pos1121"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that the qualification?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1122"><a name="pos1122"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> That is the qualification, and if the need arises for recall during adjournments obviously.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1123"><a name="pos1123"></a>NO QUESTIONS BY MS CAMBANIS</p>
<p class="line" id="line1124"><a name="pos1124"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Malindi, do you have any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1125"><a name="pos1125"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Mr Chairperson, I have about three questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1126"><a name="pos1126"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.   Go ahead.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1127"><a name="pos1127"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MALINDI:</span> Mr Mthembu, when you look at page 3 of the bundle, under paragraph 11, you give the names of Mr Thebi Mkhize and Mr Quanqua as the people who gave you instructions to conduct this attack.   What authority did Mr Mkhize and Mr Quanqua have to give these instructions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1128"><a name="pos1128"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> As I explained earlier on, sir, that Damara was a person residing at Kwamadala, whom we respected and listened to, and furthermore our people had been killed in the township, I think that is why they proposed this attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1129"><a name="pos1129"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> So the reason you obeyed his orders is that he is a person that you respected and not that he was authorised maybe by a certain organisation to give those instructions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1130"><a name="pos1130"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> As an IFP member, that is the reason why I listened to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1131"><a name="pos1131"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Could you please look at page 13 of that bundle under paragraph 18.   The first sentence reads as follows</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1132"><a name="pos1132"></a>"The attack on the 17th of June 1992 in Boipatong was not approved by the IFP leadership."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1133"><a name="pos1133"></a>Do you confirm that statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1134"><a name="pos1134"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1135"><a name="pos1135"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Could you please look at page 20 of the bundle, under paragraph 20.3, the question is</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1136"><a name="pos1136"></a>"Give particulars of the issues discussed during this meeting."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1137"><a name="pos1137"></a>And you will see at paragraph 19 that this question is in reference to a meeting held a week prior to the attack, and on page 31, your answer under paragraph 20.3 is as follows:-</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1138"><a name="pos1138"></a>"The issues discussed at this meeting was that everybody was tired of what was being done by the Comrades to our people, that is they were necklacing our people and burning our people to ashes, that is the reason why they decided to attack the residents of Boipatong."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1139"><a name="pos1139"></a>This meeting, is it the same meeting that Themba Khosa and Dlamini was sent by a minister from Ulundi were present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1140"><a name="pos1140"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I don't remember, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1141"><a name="pos1141"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Could you please look at page 29 of that bundle, at paragraph 17.1.   You mention Mr Vanana Zulu and Mr Mkhize as the people who made a decision to attack the community of the Vaal, that is Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1142"><a name="pos1142"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1143"><a name="pos1143"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Mr Zulu, one of the people who gave you instructions, as you say under paragraph 11 of your amnesty application, are you including him as a third person, or not?   If you look at page 3 of that bundle, paragraph 11 of the amnesty application, you mention Mr Mkhize and Mr Quanqua as giving instructions, my question is, in view of what is on paragraph 17.1 on page 29, are you adding Mr Vanana Zulu as the third person who gave you instructions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1144"><a name="pos1144"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Mr Chairman, I just have one problem with Mr Malindi, my learned colleague here, is he asking the questions on behalf of the same victims, or is he asking the questions on behalf of different victims, because if it's the same victims, it's my contention that the applicant cannot be cross-questioned by two people regarding the same victims.   If it's different victims, I have no problem.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1145"><a name="pos1145"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well I assume that Mr Malindi is representing different victims, whose names would be handed up in due course.   Is that the position, Mr Malindi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1146"><a name="pos1146"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> It is indeed so, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1147"><a name="pos1147"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1148"><a name="pos1148"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Mr Mthembu, is Mr Zulu the third person who gave you instructions or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1149"><a name="pos1149"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes sir, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1150"><a name="pos1150"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Was Mr Zulu present at the meeting of the 17th of June 1992?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1151"><a name="pos1151"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I do not remember that very well, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1152"><a name="pos1152"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Please look at page 8 of the bundle, paragraph 8... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1153"><a name="pos1153"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Which paragraph are you saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1154"><a name="pos1154"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> I think I'm wrong about the paragraph, Mr Chairperson may I just try to locate it quickly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1155"><a name="pos1155"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Thanks, no, because page 8 doesn't have a paragraph 8 on it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1156"><a name="pos1156"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Yes, it doesn't, yes.   Excuse me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1157"><a name="pos1157"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Paragraph 8 is on page 6.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1158"><a name="pos1158"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Page 10, Mr Chairperson, paragraph 16.  You will see at paragraph 14 that you are talking about the meeting of the 17th of June 1992, and then at paragraph 16, the second line, you say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1159"><a name="pos1159"></a>"Vanana Zulu was not present."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1160"><a name="pos1160"></a>So he could not have been at the meeting of the 17th and given you instructions, isn't it so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1161"><a name="pos1161"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Be given what instructions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1162"><a name="pos1162"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> That they should attack Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1163"><a name="pos1163"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think in putting the question to the witness, please bear in mind that this issue was canvassed earlier on, and then in paragraph 17 there's reference to the one that you've just put to the witness, and that is 17.1, where he says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1164"><a name="pos1164"></a>"To the best of my knowledge Mr Vanana Zulu and Mkhize made the decision to attack the Vaal community."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1165"><a name="pos1165"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1166"><a name="pos1166"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And then later on, at paragraph 17.3, then he talks about Mr Mkhize agreeing with Mr Quanqua to attack the residents of Boipatong.   Continue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1167"><a name="pos1167"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> As the Chairperson pleases.   What is your recollection, was Mr Zulu present at that meeting of the 17th of June, or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1168"><a name="pos1168"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I think it is as written that Mr Zulu was not there at that meeting, he was not at the meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1169"><a name="pos1169"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> What is written at paragraph 16 on page 10, that he was not at the meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1170"><a name="pos1170"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Sir, I think you are like Mr Berger, I responded to this question when Mr Berger asked it and I've already said that he was not there, he had gone home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1171"><a name="pos1171"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> And members of the Committee will stop me, seeing that they have not stopped me yet, do you confirm that what stands on paragraph 16 on page 10 is correct or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1172"><a name="pos1172"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He's just confirmed that that is correct, he was not, you're saying he was not at the meeting, Mr Mthembu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1173"><a name="pos1173"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I have explained, sir, that Mr Zulu was not present.   I don't know how many times he wants me to repeat this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1174"><a name="pos1174"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Now can you tell the Committee, where did Mr Vanana Zulu and Mr Mkhize make their decision that the Vaal community should be attacked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1175"><a name="pos1175"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I would not know where they discussed this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1176"><a name="pos1176"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Last question now, Mr Mthembu, on page 13, paragraph 18, the last sentence you say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1177"><a name="pos1177"></a>"Vanana Zulu knew about it, but he went to his family",</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1178"><a name="pos1178"></a>and I will take this to mean he knew about the attack on Boipatong.   How did he come to know about it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1179"><a name="pos1179"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I meant he knew about the attacks we suffered at the hands of the community of Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1180"><a name="pos1180"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> No, Mr Mthembu, if you look at the first line on paragraph 18, the reference is to the attack on Boipatong and you say Vanana Zulu knew about it.   How did he come to know about it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1181"><a name="pos1181"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Malindi, could this last sentence not be referring to the second sentence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1182"><a name="pos1182"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Chairperson, I submit that in the context of this paragraph, it refers to the attack on Boipatong and that all residents of Boipatong... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1183"><a name="pos1183"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But does it lend itself to that construction only?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1184"><a name="pos1184"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> It may be ambiguous, it may be - Chairperson, my learned leader refers me to the question which Mr Mthembu was referring to, which is on page 20.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1185"><a name="pos1185"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But this sentence, because it seems to me it may well be capable of being, you know, of meaning that he may have known about the meeting or he may have known that the residents of Kwamadala Hostel were afraid of Quanqua and that they were forced to attend the meeting and that's why he went home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1186"><a name="pos1186"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> No, it is capable of, it's quite capable of being a reference to that first sentence or the second sentence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1187"><a name="pos1187"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1188"><a name="pos1188"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALINDI:</span> Thank you, Chairperson, no further questions.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1205"><a name="pos1205"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1206"><a name="pos1206"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Was there a specific reason for crossing underneath this bridge?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1208"><a name="pos1208"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Was the reason to cross underneath the bridge not so that you would not be detected, this group would not be detected by other people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1209"><a name="pos1209"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I think, sir, you may not know the bridge we are talking about.   There is a rail overhead the bridge, and then there is a road underneath the bridge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1210"><a name="pos1210"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> I understood your evidence to be that when the group moved away from Kwamadala Hostel towards Boipatong, that you saw no members of the police and no members of the Defence Force, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1211"><a name="pos1211"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1212"><a name="pos1212"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Now I also understood your evidence to be that while you were in Boipatong, you were there for approximately a half an hour to an hour, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1213"><a name="pos1213"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1214"><a name="pos1214"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> While you were in Boipatong, you saw no members of the police and of the South African Defence Force, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1215"><a name="pos1215"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1216"><a name="pos1216"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> My information is that while, or after the attack, that there were numerous rocks and tree stumps in the streets, is that your recollection of that evening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1217"><a name="pos1217"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1218"><a name="pos1218"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Your statements also - or your affidavits state in two places that the police were precluded from entering Boipatong because they were barred by rocks.   Do you agree with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1219"><a name="pos1219"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1220"><a name="pos1220"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Would you agree with me that to travel by vehicle that evening in Boipatong would have been very difficult, because of the tree stumps and because of the rocks in the roads?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1221"><a name="pos1221"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, I agree.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1222"><a name="pos1222"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> I understood your evidence to be that the first time you saw some form of authority was when you were moving back to the hostel, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1223"><a name="pos1223"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1224"><a name="pos1224"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> What did you see?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1225"><a name="pos1225"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I saw police vehicles, Casspirs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1226"><a name="pos1226"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Now, it's interesting that you say that you saw Casspirs.   Did you see any other vehicles, apart from Casspirs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1227"><a name="pos1227"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> The others called V12's.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1228"><a name="pos1228"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Could you repeat that, others?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1229"><a name="pos1229"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> (Indistinct) vehicles called V12, is it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1230"><a name="pos1230"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Do you know if a V12 is a Nyala vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1231"><a name="pos1231"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I do not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1232"><a name="pos1232"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Right.   When you saw the policemen that you're referring to, how far away were you from them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1233"><a name="pos1233"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> It was quite a distance away from us, from the garage where the police were parked and the bridge where we were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1234"><a name="pos1234"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Can you estimate the distance at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1235"><a name="pos1235"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> From that bridge, it will be a distance maybe from the stage towards the end of the stage, of the hall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1236"><a name="pos1236"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> When you started being cross-examined, somebody asked you to estimate, Mr Berger asked you to estimate a distance and you gave the same estimation, that it was about 40 to 50 metres.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1237"><a name="pos1237"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think now he's referring outside of the hall.   Is it from where you are seated... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1238"><a name="pos1238"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> From the bridge, from... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1239"><a name="pos1239"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...up to the doors right at the back?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1240"><a name="pos1240"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1241"><a name="pos1241"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Can you give an estimation more or less how far this distance is?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1242"><a name="pos1242"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well he says it's from where he is up to the doors at the end of the hall, (indistinct).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1243"><a name="pos1243"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> That's about 50 metres, Mr Chairman, more or less.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1244"><a name="pos1244"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1245"><a name="pos1245"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> How long did you observe these people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1246"><a name="pos1246"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> We were walking past, I could see them as they were standing there having their Casspirs parked there, and I did not estimate how long it took for us to see them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1247"><a name="pos1247"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Can you give me an estimation, Mr Mthembu, how long did you keep these people under observation, a couple of minutes or longer, or can't you say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1248"><a name="pos1248"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Would you please repeat your question, I don't understand what you're trying to say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1249"><a name="pos1249"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> You saw a group of vehicles which you've referred to as the police.   I'd like you to give an estimation of how long you kept these people under observation.   Are you able to do so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1250"><a name="pos1250"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I am not in a position to do that, because you are talking to me, I am the one who saw them, I was walking past, going back to my place, I therefore did not estimate what time it took for us to observe these people as we were walking past, we just walked past.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1251"><a name="pos1251"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> That's exactly why I'm asking you the question, because I wasn't there, and you were there, that's why I'm asking you to tell the Committee how long you kept these people under observation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1252"><a name="pos1252"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He says he can't tell us, he's unable to tell us, he says.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1253"><a name="pos1253"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> As the Chairman pleases.   Can you describe what these people were wearing that you saw?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1254"><a name="pos1254"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> It was at night, sir, I was not in the position to see what they were wearing, what colours of clothes they were wearing, it was at night.   I just saw cars as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1255"><a name="pos1255"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Look at the question that was put to you after your amnesty application was filed.   Will you please turn to page 20, paragraph 27 please.   Do you see the question?   It says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1256"><a name="pos1256"></a>"You mentioned that you saw a police armoured vehicle outside Boipatong on the eve of the attack.  Is it possible that this vehicle you saw could have belonged to the SADF?"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1257"><a name="pos1257"></a>In other words to the South African Defence Force.   If you turn to page 33, you see the answer to paragraph 27:-</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1258"><a name="pos1258"></a>"On the night of the attack I saw a Casspir of the Stability Force Police, such as a V12.   I am very sure it was a South African Police Casspir."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1259"><a name="pos1259"></a>So in other words what you're saying is, the vehicle you saw belonged to the police and not to the Defence Force, do you agree with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1260"><a name="pos1260"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I would not know, because you have just enumerated a number of things.   You also indicated to what other names used for the V12, I just know that these vehicles were for the police and the other one for the army.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1261"><a name="pos1261"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Yes, yes, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1262"><a name="pos1262"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You see, your attention is being drawn to the question that was asked of you, and the answer that you gave to that question.   The question was, is it possible that this vehicle that you saw there belonged to the South African Defence Force, that is the question that you were asked.   Do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1263"><a name="pos1263"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, I do understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1264"><a name="pos1264"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And then your answer to that question was</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1265"><a name="pos1265"></a>"On the night of the attack, I saw a Casspir of the Stability Force Police, such as a V12.   I am sure it was a South African Police Casspir."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1266"><a name="pos1266"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, I think so, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1267"><a name="pos1267"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You don't mention seeing, you don't say that that motor vehicle could have belonged to the South African Defence Force.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1268"><a name="pos1268"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1269"><a name="pos1269"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> Mr Mthembu, you made several affidavits in your application for amnesty, and the first affidavit I understand deals with the incidents that took place at Sebokeng.   Now if you look at your subsequent affidavits, look at the first one, it runs from pages 36 to 42... (intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1270"><a name="pos1270"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Da Silva, let me ask you this, what is the South African Defence Force position, were they present or were they not present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1271"><a name="pos1271"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> The position is that they were present after the attack, not during or before the attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1272"><a name="pos1272"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Put that to the witness and let's see how he responds to it.   Perhaps we will deal with the extent to which your client is implicated much quicker.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1273"><a name="pos1273"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> As it pleases you, Mr Chairman.   My instructions are, Mr Mthembu, as contrary to what Mr Berger put to you, that the South African Defence Force did not provide 24 hours service at that stage, during June 1992.   Do you have any comment in that regard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1274"><a name="pos1274"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> There is nothing I can say, sir, because there was violence in the Vaal Triangle, we used to see police and army vehicles coming to the spa shop near Kwamadala Hostel, they would make a turn there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1275"><a name="pos1275"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> My instructions are further that immediately before the attack and during the attack, no members of the Defence Force were aware of this attack.   You can't make any comment in that regard, can you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1276"><a name="pos1276"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I would not say anything about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1277"><a name="pos1277"></a><span class="speaker">MR DA SILVA:</span> If you'll bear with me, Mr Chairman?   I have no further questions, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1278"><a name="pos1278"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1279"><a name="pos1279"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR DA SILVA</p>
<p class="line" id="line1280"><a name="pos1280"></a><span class="speaker">RE-EXAMINATION BY MS PRETORIUS:</span> Mr Mthembu, Prince Vanana Zulu was never an accused in the Boipatong trial, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1281"><a name="pos1281"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1282"><a name="pos1282"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Mr Mthembu, that night of the attack, did you loot anything from Boipatong, did you take any TV's, blankets, two plate stoves or anything for yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1283"><a name="pos1283"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, madam, yes there were such things, Advocate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1284"><a name="pos1284"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> What did you take, Mr Mthembu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1285"><a name="pos1285"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> There is nothing that I took personally, because I had what weapons I had with me and I didn't take things from Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1286"><a name="pos1286"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Oh, that's what I'm asking you.   Can you tell the Committee, this little bridge you're talking of, is that a footbridge or is it a bridge over which cars can drive?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1287"><a name="pos1287"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> I don't know, we are talking about two bridges here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1288"><a name="pos1288"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Yes, but Mr Berger put it to you that if you stand on the little bridge, you can see 900, it's 900 metres, that little bridge that you can stand on and see Boipatong, is that a footbridge or is it a bridge for vehicles?   I'm talking about the second bridge, not the bridge you came under from Kwamadala Hostel, the one that you said you had to cross to go to Boipatong and to get back from Boipatong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1289"><a name="pos1289"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> This is a pedestrian bridge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1290"><a name="pos1290"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> It's a pedestrian bridge?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1291"><a name="pos1291"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1292"><a name="pos1292"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Mr Mthembu, you also testified that there was a certain Mbatha who was killed in Boipatong before the attack on Boipatong on the 17th of June, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1293"><a name="pos1293"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, that is correct, I am sure about that, because I also have a witness here behind me, Mbatha died in his presence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1294"><a name="pos1294"></a><span class="speaker">MS PRETORIUS:</span> Can I refer you to, I have copies for all the members of the Committee, as well as the members, of the Sunday Star dated the 28th of June 1992.   It was an article written by a Mr Riaan Malan, I believe, and it reads, on the inside look out, there is a paragraph, I can tell the Committee it's just above the last paragraph with the big T, the capital T, which says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1295"><a name="pos1295"></a>"Asked why..."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1296"><a name="pos1296"></a>and they refer you to a crippled youth leaning against a wall:-</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1297"><a name="pos1297"></a>"...in February he went to meet his mother in Boipatong and he wound up in Intensive Care with a bullet in the spine.   A month earlier one Bongani Mbatha made the mistake of wearing an IFP T-shirt on an outing.   He was stoned to death.  In May a boy named Tapelo went shopping in downtown Vereeniging, presumed to be safe territory, he was abducted and burnt alive."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1298"><a name="pos1298"></a>This Mbatha, is that the same Mbatha you told the Committee of?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1299"><a name="pos1299"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, that's the same person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1300"><a name="pos1300"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You've said that Mbatha was in the company of one of your co-applicants.   Who is that co-applicant who was in the company of Mbatha when he was killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1301"><a name="pos1301"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> There is one Mbatha who is my co-accused in this case, and there's also another one who died at (Indistinct).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1302"><a name="pos1302"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you know in whose company Mbatho was when he died?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1303"><a name="pos1303"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> He was with my co-accused, Khanyile, he's just right here behind me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1304"><a name="pos1304"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And the witness you are referring to, Khanyile, Vincent Khanyile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1305"><a name="pos1305"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTHEMBU:</span> Yes, that's correct, sir.</p>
