We couldn't start this morning because it takes some time to set up the room, and then we were due to start earlier this afternoon because my colleagues were coming up on the airplane from Johannesburg, but unfortunately the plane was delayed and that accounts for the late start, so I apologise for the late start.\n\tBefore we do start, I would like to just introduce the panel to you of this sub-Committee.  On my right is Mrs Sisi Khampepe, she is an Attorney from Gauteng, on my immediate left is Mr Johnny Motata.  He is an Advocate from Johannesburg, and on my far left is Mr Jake Moloi, who is an Attorney from the Free State and I am Selwin Miller, Judge from the Eastern Cape, Transkei.  \n\tI would just like the legal representatives please to introduce themselves.

We were only drilling and Themba Qosibe was the one in charge for that kind of training.  He came from the KwaZulu Police where he was a Sergeant.\n\tHe accompanied us to Caprivi.  Others were also screened and they were checked by Doctors, white Doctors were also in Mhlahlane camp, checking their medical conditions and checking what other diseases they may have.\n\tThe kind of training that I got there, was the kind of training that was physical, including drill among others.  There came a time where we were about 206, then we were taken to Caprivi.\n\tIf I were to explain, I would also say we were taken in these huge trucks that are referred to as furniture removals.  Those trucks do not have windows.  Many people Ii think, know those trucks.  They were not necessarily meant for transporting people.  We were taken into the trucks, driven to the airport and we arrived there at round about nine o'clock from Mhlahlane camp.\n\tThere were not 206 of us in the trucks, we were divided into two groups and we were taken to the Durban airport where we caught a flight to Caprivi.",

            "Thank you.  I would like to say on arrival at the Durban airport, we did not go through the normal airport procedure as would usually be the case when people go through the check out points, or the check in points.\n\tI am saying this because later on there might be questions that might put me in a difficult position.  It is for this reason that I would like to explain that some things were not following the legal procedure and the accepted procedure, pertaining to the check in points at the airport.\n\tI am saying this because we were taken into a plane as would be the case with cargo.  The plane was very close to the furniture removal truck in which we were being transported and we jumped like cargo as it was being off loaded and loaded into another truck.\n\tThat on its own explains that there was something sinister about this whole thing.  When we arrived at the airport where we waited at twelve o'clock, we were now approaching the airport and we realised that there was life where we were now headed.\n\tWe travelled such a long distance that the flight itself, changed to freezing point.  On arrival at the airport, lights went off.  We landed at the airport with lights off and on landing, we were taken into some vehicles that are said to be armoured vehicles, Unimos, the ones that are used by soldiers.\n\tWe used almost the same system as we did in the airport where we got into the flight, it is like cargo was being loaded.   We left at about twelve o'clock at night, and we travelled for about three hours, headed for the camp at which we would finally be trained.\n\tWhat we observed along the way was that Unimos are no longer the same as furniture removals, they are a little bit open and people who did military training, would understand what kind of a vehicle I am talking about.\n\tWhat we observed however, was that the boards, the road signs and as we came here to Richard's Bay, many of you might have noticed the road signs and the boards indicating direction, indicating how far Richard's Bay is.\n\tThe kind of boards that we came across along the way were covered with sacks and plastic bags.  The kind of plastic bags that are used for garbage.  I am saying this because I know that at the end certain questions would have been answered by so doing.\n\tMaybe the Commission and the IFP lawyers who are present here, will find it easier to follow.",

            "Yes, I will do so.  Firstly I would like to explain that the training was conducted over six months.  I would also like to say that it was divided into three.  The first part was Basic Training, the second part was an Advanced Course, the third and last part was called Specialised Course.\n\tIn the first part, we were taught things like drill, physical training and knowing the basic functioning of a gun, the type of gun and how it works, before we got into the Advance Course.\n\tWe then eventually got into the Advanced Course.  In that course the course had to be more concentrated, we were taught things like field craft, that is where you are taught to behave in a military situation, and how you work in a military situation.  You should be swift and you should be intelligence and you should be accurate and know what you are doing, and do it properly.\n\tThere are different phases in the parts or different parts as I have mentioned.  There are phases like Obstacle Crossing, where you are taught how you solve an obstacle, how you overcome a certain obstacle or problems and arrive at your objective.\n\tWe were also taught about footing.  That is where you are able to follow or follow certain people, maybe your group that you are working with, tracing them and getting to them.  And also tracing your enemies, using such things as a compass.  You were taught how to use that.\n\tYou are also taught something like Fire Removements.  This include positions - knowing different positions, standing, kneeling, laying positions, how you roll, how you duck, how you take cover.  Such things in a military situation.\n\tWe were also taught things like the buddy-buddy system where you are taught how you cooperate or how you work with some buddy, working shoulder to shoulder.  How you compliment your movements, how you take different stands against the enemy.\n\tWe also learnt things like house penetration, knowing how you enter a house.  Maybe your target is inside, how you enter or penetrate the house and kill the target and not other people.\n\tHow you enter through locked doors, what clues do you look for.  If you want to remove yourself from a scene of crime, or if you want to eliminate all evidence, we were also taught things like assassination.  How to kill your leaders or leaders of the community.  We were taught how to assassinate such people.\n\tWe were also taught about reconnaissance under the second phase.  Reconnaissance is where you are taught how to trace a person, follow a person.  You should know what he does in his daily life, what he watches on TV, what time he knocks off work every day, his routine.\n\tSomething that he does almost every day, like going to work, coming back from work, going to play golf and so forth.  That was included under what we called \"recce\", reconnaissance.\n\tWe were taught such things, knowing what a person does in his daily life, what car he drives, knowing the type of car that he uses.  We also learnt about kidnapping, where you take a person against his will.  That is, he does this involuntarily.  You force him to do so.  It could be that you are going to kill him, or maybe you want to get some information from him that will help you or your organisation.\n\tWe were taught about this and we were taught about the different ways of kidnapping so that people don't know or don't realise that you are kidnapping the person.\n\tWe learnt this in the Advanced Course.  We also learnt about different guns.  We learnt about Eastern Block weapons.  Those weapons are not used in South Africa.  A lot of people don't know about them.  If I can be permitted to enumerate the guns that we used, like the AK47 ...",

M.Z. Khumalo was then called and he addressed us and told us that the objective was not to become Kits Constables, but the objective was that the community of Pietermaritzburg had put a request through the IFP President, that they were experiencing difficulties.  They were being attacked by the ANC.\n\tBecause of that, and because the ANC was being assisted by the South African Police against Inkatha, therefore the IFP was in trouble.  Therefore Dr Buthelezi had spoken to SAP authorities about this issue.\tHe had therefore agreed with the SAP that he would bring his own people that were loyal and trustworthy to the organisation, that will be recruited into the SAP and investigate this allegation that the SAP was cooperating with the ANC, and they would in turn use means of attacking the ANC.\n\tIt was for that reason that we were to join this group that was responsible for controlling riots.  Special Constables were used mainly to guard certain people, and also to control riots because they would work closely with the Riot Unit.\n\tTherefore they would be directly responsible in cases like toyi-toyi and political activity.  Therefore they needed people who could carry out this mission properly.  Therefore our mission was to infiltrate the SAP as Special Constables, so that we could attack the ANC as Special Constables in Pietermaritzburg region.\n\tWhen M.Z.

I also remember the Gundani bus stop incident.\n\tWhat I would like to explain first is that this is not known publicly as the Gundani bus stop.  I have referred to it as Gundani bus stop in my affidavit because there was a joint where that was nearer the bus stop.  That is why I am referring to it as the Gundani bus stop, because it is near this shibeen.\n\tWe knew that the ANC was going to hold a rally.  I cannot remember very well whether it was a rally or a conference but we had already gathered information to the effect that they were going to ride busses out of eSikhawini.  We verified the information and we learnt that they were going to come back home after that rally or conference.\n\tUsually when people were gathering to board busses, they would sing or chant slogans and sing songs.  We concluded that we would be able to spot the busses and we wanted to attack them on their way back in the evening.  We were hoping that they would delay so that they could come back when it was dark.\n\tI was not able to get everybody who would assist in the attack, but the ones that I managed to get hold of included Joyful Mthetwa and he too was a Caprivian, but he was based at Ntseleni that is where he resided.\n\tHe was part of the attack, because I had already sent Zweli Dhlamini to explain to him that there is an operation in which I wanted him to participate.  I have also forgotten to say earlier on that Joyful Mthetwa is one of the people that, whose name was actually raised by Captain Langeni to the fact that I was going to work with him.\n\tI agreed to work with him, I didn't have a problem, I knew what kind of a person he was.\n\tWe then waited for the busses to return and we identified a place where we could lay our ambush.  We saw one bus approaching as we were laying in wait for their approach.  \n\tThere were three of us there, it was myself, Joyful Mthetwa, and Victor Buthelezi.  I would like to explain something about Victor Buthelezi so that the Commission can get to know him.  He was not a Caprivian, but he was a staunch IFP member.   He used to be the body guard of Bebebeyela who was a Mayor.\n\tHe was a fully fledged Policeman based at the eSikhawini police station and then he was assigned to the body guard position to the Mayor.  He was a strong Inkatha member.\n\tAs I have already indicated how we used to communicate with Bebebeyela, there was a time where we could use Victor as our driver in our operations, and that is how he got involved.\n\tAt the Gundani attack, as I have pointed out, there were three of us and we lay flat on our stomach.  I remember I had a hand grenade and also I had an RG5 or something like that.  We also had rifles, all of us and we also had pistols, magazines and magazines which were loaded because we wanted to hit as many people in the bus as we could.\n\tWhen this bus approached, which bus we knew and thought was ferrying the people from the rally, and knowing that that was the ANC area, the bus came to a halt and we were laying just next to the bus stop, laying a detachment pattern, such as would be the case in an extended line.\n\tEach one of us had their own positions in readiness for firing, deciding as to whether we were going to hit the wheels from the front to the back and vice versa, and everybody would aim a particular position and those who were getting off the bus.  That is how we had planned our attack.\n\tWe did exactly that and I still remember very well that I was the one who was supposed to pull of the hand grenade pin and throw it into the bus so that they could be confused, at which time we would start shooting.\n\tThat we did.  When the bus grounded to a halt, I threw in the hand grenade, it exploded inside and we started shooting.  There was a lot of pandemonium in the bus, diesel started leaking, we continued shooting.\n\tI have no idea how many people died, I cannot be certain, but yes, we did that.  I remember that I was not arrested for that incident and I was not even prosecuted for that, and none among us were prosecuted or asked about the incident, but people, yes, were injured and some died, even though I don't know how many and who they were.\n\tI also remember that I reported to Captain Langeni that we had already killed the people and he was excited about that.",

I would not want to concentrate on that, because it doesn't involve me.\n\tWhat information was available at the disposal of the local IFP leadership, was that Mr Mtimkhulu had now become dangerous because he was now rubbing shoulders with people like Khumalo, discussing sensitive dockets as already explained.\n\tWe are now in danger so that what covert operation we were involved in, could now be exposed to people and even our leaders run the risk of being arrested.  We were at war because of that, because we wanted to protect the organisation so that it doesn't end up in trouble, and we did not want to lose our fighting members, it would not be a good idea that these people be arrested.\n\tThat is the reason why Mr Mtimkhulu had to be killed.

I used to see him in the company of Siphiwe Mbuyasi.  They were very close friends.\n\tSiphiwe is well known in Durban as a well known person, a member of Inkatha and he was known to be strongly against the ANC.  Those are things that were even publicised.\n\tThere was also rumour to the effect that he is very close to the Inkatha President.

I thought that there might be certain political things that he is aware of because at the time we used to call him our oxen, so to speak.\n\tI trusted that if I approached him, I would be able to use him.  He was physically fit and he used to exercise quite a lot, and he was not drinking any alcohol.  He did not often associate with women and that made me conclude that I could use him in the operations.\n\tI started one step at a time, asking him when last he saw Siphiwe and he would respond, not knowing what my intention was.  I would ask him how Siphiwe was doing in Durban and he finally indicated without realising that he is indeed a staunch Inkatha member.\n\tOne day I told him that I would visit him at J2 where he was residing, and that on its own made me realise that he was indeed a strong member of Inkatha, because Mbambo used to reside freely in that area because the very same boys that I was talking about, were very strong in the area.\n\tMbambo indeed agreed that I should come and speak to Siphiwe, speak to him.  I went to see him and I indicated to him that it is important that we discussed these things.  He indicated to me that he knew that there were Israels, he would refer to the Caprivians as Israels.\n\tHe knew that there were Israels, but his problem is that he didn't know who they were, he cannot identify them.  But he has knowledge about their existence and I indicated to him and I am one of the Israels.\n\tI told him this is how I want us to work.  Even though he started doubting and hesitantly and he wanted to ensure that what I intended doing, had the blessing of authorities.  I told him that if I were to disclose authorities to you, you should know that there is no retreat, because if you were to retreat, that will be the end of you.\n\tYou should involve yourself knowing exactly what is going to happen and one day we arranged, I spoke, telephoned Captain Langeni, indicating to him that I have already roped in someone whom I wanted, he should meet.\n\tWorking with Mbambo would not be the same as working with Mdwane.

He was really angry, asking what our duties are if the ANC is still so strong and still has the capacity to disrupt our meetings.\n\tWe tried to give reasons and he then told us that we should use the same strategies that were used by the ANC, because the ANC is shooting indiscriminately leadership, followership and everybody and that was very dangerous to the organisation because we are dealing with people here and the issue is support.\n\tPeople would follow the kind of an organisation where there would be protection because protection is exactly what the people want.  A person would not join an organisation if he cannot be protected and therefore we should not allow ourselves to target only leadership, we should just attack indiscriminately so that the ANC can realise that they are being beaten and they, by so doing, will weaken and this is how we can gain support.

            "As I have already explained that Prince Gideon Zulu had already issued out an instruction that we should follow the same strategy as was being used by the ANC, by attacking mobs, attack ordinary ANC followers so that we could fight for support.\n\tWe agreed even though in his absence, and that we did with my group, that we were indeed going to do exactly as it was suggested.  I also remember the Gundani bus stop incident.\n\tWhat I would like to explain first, is that this is not known publicly as the Gundani bus stop.  I have referred to it as the Fundani bus stop in my affidavit, because there was a joint where that was nearer the bus stop.\n\tThat is why I am referring to it as the Gundani bus stop because it is near this shibeen.  We knew that the ANC was going to hold a rally.  I cannot remember very well whether it was a rally or a conference, but we had already gathered information to the effect that they were going to ride busses out of eSikhawini.\n\tWe verified the information and we learnt that they were going to come back home after that rally or conference.  Usually when people were gathering to board busses, they would sing or chant slogans and sing songs and we concluded that we will be able to spot the busses and we wanted to attack them on their way back in the evening.\n\tWe were hoping that they would delay so that they would come back when it was dark.  I was not able to get everybody who would assist in the attack, but the ones that I managed to get hold of included Joyful Mthetwa and he too was a Caprivian, but he was based at Ntseleni, that is where he resided.\n\tHe was part of the attack because I had already sent Zweli Dhlamini to explain to him that there is an operation in which I wanted him to participate.  I have also forgotten to say earlier on that Joyful Mthetwa is one of the people, whose name was actually raised by Captain Langeni to the effect that I was going to work with him.\n\tI agreed to work with him, I didn't have a problem, I knew what kind of a person he was.   We then waited for the busses to return and we identified a place where we could lay our ambush.  We saw one bus approaching as we were laying in wait for their approach.  There were three of us there, it was myself, Joyful Mthetwa and Victor Buthelezi.\n\tI would like to explain something about Victor Buthelezi so that the Commission can get to know him.  He was not a Caprivian,  but he was a staunch IFP member.  He used to be the body guard of Bebebeyela who was a Mayor.\n\tHe was a fully fledged Policeman based at the eSikhawini Police station and then he was assigned to the body guard position to the Mayor.  He was a strong Inkatha member.\n\tAs I have already indicated how we used to communicate with Bebebeyela, there was a time where we could use Victor as our driver in our operations and that is how he got involved.\n\tAt the Gundani attack, as I have pointed out, there were three of us and we lay flat on our stomach.  I remember I had a hand grenade and also I had an RG5 or something like that.  We also had rifles, all of us and we also had pistols, magazines and magazines which were loaded, because we wanted to hit as many people in the bus as we could.\n\tWhen this bus approached which bus we knew and thought was ferrying the people from the rally, and knowing that that was the ANC area, the bus came to a halt and we were laying just next to the bus stop, laying in a touchment pattern such as would be the case in an extended line.\n\tEach one of us had their own positions in readiness for firing, deciding as to whether we were going to hit the wheels from the front or the back, and vice versa, and everybody would aim a particular position and those who were getting off the bus.  That is how we have planned our attack.\n\tWe did exactly that and I still remember very well that I was the one who was supposed to pull off the hand grenade pin and throw it into the bus so that they could be confused at which time we would start shooting.  That we did.  When the bus grounded to a halt, I threw in the hand grenade, it exploded inside and we started shooting.  There was a lot of pandemonium in the bus.  Diesel started leaking, we continued shooting.\n\tI have no idea how many people died, I cannot be certain but yes, we did that.  I remember that I was not arrested for that incident and I was not even prosecuted for that, none among us were prosecuted or asked about the incident, but people, yes, were injured and some died, even though I don't know how many and who they were.\n\tI also remember that I reported to Captain Langeni that we had already killed the people and he was excited about that.",

            "As I have already explained that Mr Welcome Mtimkhulu was one of the people who were on the hit list because he was rubbing shoulders with the ANC and there were rumours and suspicions.\n\tThe local leadership had a way of gathering information, which way I do not know and therefore I don't want to commit myself as to how they gathered the information, but certainly there was a way of gathering information and there were also things like BSI which we knew that they had files which they used to follow up ANC leaders.  I would not want to concentrate on that, because it doesn't involve me.\n\tWhat information was available at the disposal of the local IFP leadership, was that Mr Mtimkhulu had now become dangerous because he was now rubbing shoulders with people like Khumalo, discussing sensitive dockets as already explained.\n\tWe are now in danger so that what covert operations we were involved in, could now be exposed.  People, and even our leaders run the risk of being arrested and we were at war because of that, because we wanted to protect the organisation so that it doesn't end up in trouble, and we did not want to lose our fighting members, it would not be a good idea that these people be arrested.\n\tThat is the reason why Mr Mtimkhulu had to be killed.  I also remember that on the day when he was to be killed, we took Bebebeyela's car, Bebebeyela being a Mayor, it was a Ford Meteor, white and small.  Victor Buthelezi who was his body guard, drove the car for us.\n\tVictor was in the car, myself, Romeo Mbambo and Joyful Mthetwa, Zweli Dhlamini was also in the car.  There is also another member who was present at the time of the attack, and that is Pios Ndlovu.  He was a Police at the eSikhawini station, also trained at Caprivi.\n\tOn that day, he was ... (tape ends) ... and we proceeded, but I can also say that during the day I tried to establish as to how he got to work, that was Mr Mtimkhulu and I learnt that he was going to report for work the following day, at ten, the day prior to his attack.\n\tI engaged in reconnaissance and also learnt that he was no longer residing at his home, he was now taking occupation at one of the houses that were flats at the upper H2.  On following this up, I saw a green Skyline parked on the driveway.  \n\tBy so doing, I confirmed that he was indeed residing in that area.  I started looking for an appropriate spot from which we could shoot him, and when we approached H1 together with the guys whose names I have mentioned, I still remember, we entered via H1 and we proceed until we were parked near a house wherein a certain Mr Makwanasi, he was also an ANC member, used to reside, we parked in front of this house.  The house is in an area that is a little steep and from that area, one would be able to walk or drive across to the other section.\n\tWe parked at the H1 section, not where we shot him, so that Victor Buthelezi remained behind the steering wheel.  We left the car there and walked on foot to the other side.\n\tMr Mtimkhulu was supposed to drive passed place with a T-junction at which place he would be forced to slow down because he was supposed to turn, proceed straight to the bus stop.\n\tHis car approached and I must also mention that we laid there early before ten in the morning - evening, and waited until we saw his car reversing and driving towards our direction.  And we laid down over the road, so that we could be able to aim and shoot.  I still remember very well that two of these people lay behind me as a back up so that in case one of us is injured, they should be able to rescue him and flee with him, and as the car was slowing down, trying to turn to the left, we started opening fire.\n\tWe opened fire directing the shots to his car.  We were not sure who the occupants of the car were, we were not even sure as to whether Mr Mtimkhulu was in the car or not.  But we had this belief that it must be Mtimkhulu because on looking at the turn that we were looking at, it corresponded and we concluded that it must be him on his way to work.\n\tWe then shot at the car and it jerked.  We thought the driver must be engaging gears and we concluded he must be hit, we must have hit him.  We thought the car would stop, but it engaged in another gear and fled at a high speed.  We concluded that we must have failed.  There was a gun, a Scorpion which is powerful and P.S. who is small in body structure, we thought that as he was firing, he got empowered by the strong gun, and all the bullets missed the target.\n\tThe gun jerked up and resulting in him missing the target because of his small body structure.  After that, we left the scene, got into the car and we fled.  I went back to the Police station where I waited for any sign because when we left, we concluded that perhaps they would go to the Police station to report the incident, but nothing was reported and I could not get any information.  I too was not in the position to make enquiries, because I did not want to be exposed.\n\tThereafter it transpired that they went to report at Empangeni Police station where they were told that they could not take up the case, because that was not their jurisdiction.  They were referred back to eSikhawini and we hoped that the incident would be reported, so that a docket could be opened, but it never occurred.\n\tLater I learnt that Mr Mtimkhulu was not even in the same car that we shot at.  It transpired that there were women in the car, and according to information that we gathered, nobody died, but some people were injured.\n\tI reported this incident to Captain Langeni, that we tried to assassinate Mr Mtimkhulu but we failed, and we would go for a second attempt, but we did not do the second attempt.\n\tWe were not arrested for the case, we were not prosecuted therefore.",

            "As I already explained that we tried to weaken up the strength and support of the ANC, so that the community could realise that they were supporting a weak and failing organisation.\n\tThe Ntokozweni attack therefore was along the same strategy and belief that Mr Mtimkhulu should be attacked and the car took us to some veld near the eSikhawini College of Education.  We went into this veld with an aim of attacking eMalahleni.\n\tI have indicated to the Commission that eMalahleni was a place well known, that even the cat there is ANC.  We knew fully well that workers whom we would encounter at the bus stop, were obviously ANC and on arrival these workers were singing there.  They were singing liberation songs.\n\tThe ANC was very strong in that section, it was a section that had become worrisome to us, we wanted to disrupt that and disrupt their singing so that they could end up not trusting one another.\n\tWe walked into the bush from the training side, that is the College of Education side.  People were waiting at the bus stop on their way to work, and we advanced towards their direction and we took up our positions, and we lay flat at a place, the very same place that is bushy and we started shooting towards their direction.\n\tWe did not want to shoot a specific person, but we were just shooting following the strategy about which I spoke earlier on.\n\tOn shooting, they scattered and others retreated and there were some small markets, vegetable and fruit markets in the area and some people took cover behind the market and they shot back.\n\tWe realised that some of these people were armed and I started using the military tactic and I indicated that we should not be defeated here, because if they defeated us here, they will start attacking our places.\n\tOn shooting, they continued shooting back and they were able to do so because they were shooting us from cover and we were just hiding in the bush.  We realised that this is dangerous, we should retreat and that is what we did.\n\tWe retreated, I was also trying to avoid losing one of my members.  We realised that they were using pistols, we could determine that from the kind of sounds.   We were not in a position to shoot from where we were hiding, because it was not safe at all and they were better placed, because they would only shoot when it was safe to do so.\n\tWe retreated until we fled back and each one of us took a different direction and we ultimately came across Romeo.  We could not even see Victor, the car was not there, we could not even see Joyful and everybody just disappeared.\n\tIt was now difficult for me to go back to see this people, because now that we have retreated, this people must be approaching.  Romeo suggested that we go to the Mayor's house.  We walked to the Mayor's house.   We came across cars and we had to keep hiding the rifles that we were carrying.  Some cars were just driving past and we ultimately arrived at the Mayor's house and asked where the people were.\n\tThe Mayor asked me the same question, and we told him narrating to him that things did not go as planned and he got a fright.  Our main worry was that they may have been shot and most probably left laying in the bush.  It was a concern that if their corpses were found in the bush, this would create a problem.\n\tThe Mayor and I decided to get into the car to go and look for them, but at the same time before we got into the car, they arrived and that became better.  We concluded that already there were suspicions among the community that the Mayor's car is usually seen ferrying us in particular around, and it was therefore no longer safe to drive around at night, because there was a lot of shooting taking place.\n\tWe tried to observe the situation for a while, and the Police also waited and we hoped that this would be reported, but nothing was reported at the Police station.\n\tIt transpired that the ANC members had undertaken not to report anything at the Police station, because such cases are not investigated and no one is arrested, instead Inkatha are found in a better position, and they could not report the matter at Empangeni because Empangeni would refer them back to eSikhawini.\n\tI don't know whether some people were hurt or killed during the shooting incident, but I still remember very well that there was a rumour to the effect that there is one who was badly hit in the head.  I don't know who he was and how much he was injured.\n\tTherefore we were not prosecuted and sentenced for the incident, but it happened exactly as I am explaining it.",

Makwanasi was alleged to be most prominent in smuggling guns and he did not only operate in the eSikhawini area, but he was also influential in the attacks on Inkatha at kwaDlangezwa.  He was helping the ANC there.\n\tWe also discovered that Makwanasi had started the idea of two way communication, that they had walkie talkies that they used when they patrolled in the evening, and they would use this to communicate and they were working in cooperation with the hostels, the  (indistinct) and the other hostel where they had their members who had infiltrated the hostels.\n\tThere were also MK members who used to come periodically to the hostels, that they used to communicate with.  Makwanasi was alleged to be in charge of the protection of ANC members, which involved smuggling weapons, but that was the information that we had.\n\tThe part that I have explained on patrolling in the evenings, communicating through these radio's and we couldn't get hold of these weapons, as a Policeman we tried many times to get these weapons from the hostels, from raids, but we couldn't get the weapons.\n\tWe would receive information that just before we entered the hostel, Makwanasi would have just left the hostel with the weapons that we are looking for.  He had a sky blue car, I think it was a Ford, a station wagon of some kind.\n\tThis is the car that was alleged to carry weapons that were used to attack IFP members.  That way it was decided that he should be removed.  There was a term that was used, that he should take the first bus.   I remember that on that day, we first met at Mrs Mbuyasi's house, Israel was there, Romeo as well, myself and Zweli Dhlamini.\n\tThere were three of us when we left and we were driving Mr Bebebeyela's Ford Meteor.  There were supposed to be four of us who left the house, but ultimately there were just three of us who left.\n\tOur purpose for leaving the house was just reconnaissance, following him, tracking him, finding out where he is, what he is doing.  Romeo was driving and I was in the passenger seat.  Zweli Dhlamini was in the back seat.\n\tIn J1 we saw Mr Makwanasi's car and it was reversing from a particular house and we passed and turned and came back, and we followed the car.  We followed the car out of J1 and we followed it closely.  When we were approaching the eSikhawini crossing, just before we approached the crossing, I concluded that he was going to the hostel, so we decided to overtake him so that he would be following us, and we would watch him from the rear view mirror.\n\tThis we did and we turned towards Nqobele.  It appeared like we were going to the (indistinct) supermarket.  Makwanasi did not do as we had expected, he turned into the opposite direction, following the road out of  kwaDlangezwa.\n\tWe then made a u-turn and crossed and followed him.  As we were approaching the bridge, there were two lanes on the road, two lanes in the same direction, so that cars could travel on different lanes, but going in the same direction.\n\tAs we approached the bridge, we decided this was an ideal opportunity, we should hit him there and then.  We agreed, all three of us.  This was the ideal opportunity to hit him.\n\tWe followed him closely and we realised that there were two of them in the car.  We pretended to overtake the car.  When the car was just next to his on the steep, because I was in the passenger seat, I was directly opposite their car.\n\tI was nearest to him.  We travelled some distance, the two cars next to each other.  I then took out my gun, the G3 gun, but I tried to shoot but the gun jammed twice.  I then did what is called immediate action drill, trying to see what is wrong, what is jamming the gun.\n\tWhilst I was still doing this, Romeo then accelerated.  As he did this, our car would be slightly in front of this other car.  Romeo made sure that our car was in line with his at the back seat, that is Zweli Dhlamini would be in line with the driver of the other car.\n\tOur car was now slightly in front of the other car and Zweli Dhlamini at the back seat was the one who was now directly opposite the driver of the other car.  Zweli then took out a .765 and he shot at that driver.  He used only one shot and hit him on the head, and the car careered off the road and Romeo accelerated and we sped off.\n\tWe eventually joined the main road to kwaDlangezwa, proceeding towards Forest Inn.  When we approached the road towards Port Dunfort, we entered this road and from Port Dunfort, we returned to eSikhawini.  I went to the Police station after delivering the guys I was with, to find out if the incident had been reported.\n\tThe incident had been reported at the Police station, there were two people in the car, Makwanasi and one other boy.  The boy was not hurt, it was only Makwanasi who got shot.  I reported this incident to Captain Langeni in Ulundi by telephone.  He was very pleased that we had managed to kill this animal.\n\tNobody was charged or convicted for this crime, there were no investigations or prosecution, nothing happened.\n\tI returned the car to Bebebeyela and I told him about what we had done.

To the wife of Mr Makwanasi and his children and his entire family, it is very difficult for me to say anything because I understand clearly that even if I were to apologise and beg for their forgiveness on my knees, this will not help them in any way.\n\tIt will not help them with their children's education, it will not help her pay her rent.  I do not wish for any other person to be in my situation now, I request the Makwanasi family to hand me over to God, because I have accepted that whatever happens to me is okay.  What I did, the people I killed, I thought I did this with clear objectives.  I request that one day they should find it in their hearts to forgive me.\n\tI don't even want to suggest that the death of Mr Makwanasi was because of political reasons, because the death of a person cannot be equated to politics.  The death of a person or the killing of somebody is not acceptable for whatever reason.  I understand fully what I have done to the Makwanasi family, something they will never forget.\n\tBut I am thankful that I have been able to see the light through the Grace of God.  What I am saying today or what I am explaining here is not just because I want to be granted amnesty, it is also because when I die, I wish to have said everything.  I am grateful that I have accepted the Lord and realised that my life previously was not acceptable, it was criminal.

            "In this incident, as I have already explained that even though instructions came from Captain Langeni, it was mostly things that I knew of because we were on good terms and cooperated with the local leadership of the IFP at eSikhawini.\n\tI knew about this things, but it was not policy that I should know why the person was being killed.  My job was to get instructions from Captain Langeni to kill someone.  It happened by chance sometimes that I knew the reasons for killing a person.\n\tThis happened because of the good cooperation between myself and the local leadership of the IFP at eSikhawini.  \n\tThere was an allegation that Mr Nqumalo was involved in mobilising in the factories.  I think he worked at a certain factory in Richards Bay.  There were certain people in these factories who were IFP members, who brought it to the attention of the IFP leadership at eSikhawini that Mr Nqumalo was very active in opposing the IFP and the kwaZulu Police in the factories where he worked.\n\tThe greatest problem about him was that he was very persuasive and people listened to him.  When he mobilised against the IFP, he could sway the people that he was talking to, he could convince them to hate the IFP.  He was reportedly very good at mobilising.\n\tThere was also an allegation that Mr Nqumalo was highly regarded in the ANC and was earmarked to contest a Mayoral position.  If this happened, and he got the support, this would overthrow Mr Bebebeyela.  This could be problematic for the organisation because if Bebebeyela was no longer in authority, our organisation would have been harmed.  If I can make an example, things like the news of Klangelani Hall, that was not granted to the ANC, they could not use that hall because Bebebeyela was in position, in authority.\n\tThe ANC could not even hold gatherings because of this, so if Mr Bebebeyela lost his position, the IFP would be harmed.   If Mr Nqumalo was in a position to contest this position with Mr Bebebeyela and win over Bebebeyela such that the ANC will then be in control of the area, the ANC would use that opportunity to wipe out the IFP because they would have the authority and therefore the power to wipe out the IFP.\n\tThat was the reason why Nqumalo was targeted to be killed.  I remember that on the day we were using Mr Bebebeyela's Ford Meteor.  I remember that I was driving the car.  Victor was with me, Romeo was also present.  I had fetched him from a course at aMatikulu.\n\tZweli Dhlamini was also there.  Israel as well.  When we left we were just intending to do reconnaissance, not really to hit him on that day, but we had our weapons with us.  But when we passed his house, we saw him coming from the house, he was with certain people, approaching the gate.\n\tWe then passed the house.  Who knew him was Victor Buthelezi, Mr Bebebeyela's body guard.   He was the person who was going to point him out to us.  When he advanced to - we proceeded on.  I cannot remember quite well how many people were in his company, three or four, I cannot remember, it is quite long.\n\tHe was in the company of males.  He looked like a person who was walking them to the gate after a short visit to his home.  We drove passed and we parked at a dust road.  We put off the car to look around, it was beginning to get dark, dusky.\n\tWe came back on foot.   It is quite a short distance.  On walking back, we walked back at the time when they were actually parting, that is why I am saying he was actually walking them to the gate after a visit.\n\tWe have now decided to make use of this opportunity and on getting nearer to them, Victor pointed him out to us.  We shot him and he dropped dead, and we fled.\n\tI took the steering wheel and on starting the car, I saw a KZP bakkie leaving at a high speed.  Isn't it gunfires had been heard already.\n\tI drove without having turned on my headlights and this KZP van followed us and we fled right up to Mkoboza with the same people in my company.  I drove further down, taking the eMalahleni road, and we were still being pursued by this KZP van.  I took my left at Mazankala, approaching the road that was connecting us to kwaDlangezwa.\n\tThe very same KZP van was pursuing us.  We decided to stop and speak to the Police and they indicated some people in the car, some people in the car in which we were travelling, indicated that if we did that, we would be arrested, because in the very same Police Force, there were ANC Police people who were planted to work within the Police Force and we didn't know what the situation would be like if we stopped.\n\tIsrael suggested that we should just shoot at them, but we hesitated.  We didn't think of that as a good idea and we exchanged ideas as we were fleeing and the van was right at our heels.  They apparently noticed that we are the ones that opened fire, and I approached the crossing at kwaDlangezwa and the van was still at our heels.\n\tWe took the Empangeni road, still being pursued and we decided that we should overtake the cars ahead of us, and I would turn off my headlamps and proceed overtaking, so that the ones pursuing us, should not see when we indicate and overtake.\n\tI just turned off my headlamps, overtook some cars and proceeded on.  We arrived at some place, I am not sure whether it is Bassonia, and there is a road there that proceeds towards Ndebayake and we took a dusty road at some sugar plantation and the van that was pursuing us, proceeded on and we concluded that we have actually managed to get away.\n\tWe took back the correct registration numbers for the vehicle in which we were travelling and we took out several things, like guns and hand grenades and we suggested that people like Zweli should walk on foot.  We decided that there is no way that we can be found now that we are travelling in the car with its correct registration number.\n\tAll the guns and arms that we had, had been off loaded from the car and we remained with our licensed firearm.  The group that were left there, walked on foot towards Nqwelezwani, heading for M.R. Mkhize who was in charge of the Inkatha Offices at Empangeni.\n\tMyself and Romeo stayed behind and we were to drive back.  I had to take Romeo back to (indistinct), and the remaining group proceeded on with the guns that we left behind, and we drove back to eSikhawini.\n\tI went to the Police station and I learnt that the incident had already been reported at the Police station.  If I still remember very well, I arrived at the same time as the hearse was arriving to pick up the corpse.  I reported to my authorities that we have already done it, they were happy that we had finally eliminated Naftha Nqumalo.\n\tWe were not charged, nor arrested, nor prosecuted for the incident.  The case just disappeared, just like that, to date.",

In fact I am the one who suggested that I use people who were not Caprivians.  There were people who were within the Police Force, who were not Caprivians and who had not been members of the hit squad on its formation, but who joined this formation later, people like Victor Buthelezi who was a Constable at the Police.  He was not trained for anything else except for the Police Force.\n\tPeople like Constable Lucky Mbandwa, people such as those were not Caprivians, but we did not form the hit squad around them.  As time went on, they joined in resulting from necessity and the need for manpower.\n\tWe trusted such people on realising on how committed they were to fighting rather for the movement and this was necessitated by the tension and the fight that was going on between the ANC and the IFP and these was growing on a daily basis, where people were dying and houses were set alight.\n\tThere was therefore a need for a greater manpower to come and help out.  Therefore I agree that there were members who ended up joining the operations resulting from their honesty and trustworthiness.  But I cannot lie here and say I also took them like Romeo, to introduce them to our authorities because they did not demand that I do that.\n\tRomeo is a special case, because he is the one who insisted to be introduced to the authorities, he wanted guarantee as to his security.

These first two people who were shot by Israel following my instruction, are not near, anywhere near the meeting.  They were a distance away from the meeting, but in the same section, which section we knew had ANC followers.  That is the first thing I would like to say.\n\tWe have not yet arrived at the meeting to which we were headed.  We shot these people knowing that they were ANC members, because they were walking freely around the area at that time.  That was not a planned intention, and we knew that the firing of the guns, shooting at these two people, could not be picked up by the people to which we were going.\n\tWe were just shooting, knowing that this is an ANC area.  What disrupted the meeting, or our plan however, is that on arriving at Mzingwena entrance point, we were sitting inside the Husky, quiet.  There was not even an indication that a meeting was going on.  There was absolutely nothing to the effect that there was a meeting in that school.\n\tWe started doubting as to whether the meeting was indeed going on or not, but it was also equally difficult to get off the Husky because we could be easily identified if we went out to verify the progression of the meeting.\n\tAs we were sitting there, we concluded that there was no meeting, we must have gathered wrong information.  There came this person, the third person and Israel was a distance from us.  I cannot remember very well who shouted at who, saying first bus.  By that time, we had become disillusioned, knowing of course that that was the ANC area and we had come to attack the ANC members following the reasons that I have enumerated earlier, and we just decided not to hit people as they were dispersing, and on shooting at this person, we got back into the car and left.",

If I still remember very well, Zweli Dhlamini was with me, Romeo as well.\n\tRomeo and Israel stayed behind in the car, that was at night.  I spoke to Indians who were owners of the place and I indicated to them that I was a Police and I produced my appointment certificate, and they gave me permission to proceed into his house.\n\tI found him in the house and he was in the company of someone.  I spoke to him, explaining to him that I am detaining him because I want to investigate him and his implication in a certain case, and he agreed.  He put on his clothes and we left.\n\tAs he was just about to get into the car, he saw Romeo in the car.  On seeing Romeo in the car, he screamed and he started refusing to get into the car.  We realised that now that he is screaming, this might lead to our arrest and we pushed him forcefully into the car.\n\tAndile took the steering wheel and we drove off, and we brought him back to eSikhawini.  We were trying along the way to plead with him to tell us the truth as to people who were involved in planning everything and why they did it.\n\tHe kept on refusing and denying everything, saying he knows nothing and when we were near Mandeni, he started owning up, indicating that there was nothing he could do himself as well, because he would be killed if he refused to be part of the plot.\n\tWe proceeded and we had not indicated to him that he might die.  We just told him that we are going to investigate him because we want to arrest everybody who is implicated in the plot against Romeo.\n\tThen we drove on to eSikhawini.  Here at eSikhawini we took the road that headed for Port Dunfort.  The one that proceeds straight to the sea.  There are bushes around that area.\n\tOn arrival at the bush, we took him out of the car and Nathi realised that there was no substance to the detaining story and he started fighting back.  He beat us and we beat him back.  He was fighting such that if he had found a chance to slip, he would flee and that would be attempted murder.\n\tWe outnumbered him, it was myself, Zweli, Israel Hlongwane and Romeo and Andile Xele.  We tried to surround him until we got a full grip of him and we were at this Port Dunfort bush towards the sea.\n\tAs we were struggling, we all fell down.  Israel drew a .38 pistol and on attempting to shoot him, the pistol jammed.  Nathi prayed at the time and the second attempt at shooting him, resulted in nothing happening.\n\tNathi also continued praying, calling upon his ancestors.  We quickly fixed the pistol, Nathi still under our firm grip, myself and Romeo.\n\tWe managed to get the pistol fixed, we were forced to use that pistol because it doesn't leave a cartridge behind, which cartridge would be used to trace us.  The gun, the pistol finally worked and Israel shot him whilst we were still holding him.  Two shots were fired.\n\tWe then left.  On getting into the car, we thought that the ANC has a tendency to burning IFP members on killing them, that was a common practice, because it was a common ANC practice to burn these people on killing them.  The UDF would equally necklace people, this was not a common Inkatha practice, it was mainly the practice within the ANC, to necklace people.\n\tWe thought that so that we can mislead evidence and any track of information, let us do exactly as the ANC does.  Let us also burn this one so that the investigation can direct itself to the ANC and not the IFP, because it was the ANC that was popularly known at the time, to have a slogan to the effect that they will liberate the country with matches.\n\tIf a person was found dead, this would have to be associated with the ANC, because they believed in liberating the country through the tyre and a match.  We did this trusting that we would mislead investigation and we wanted the ANC to feel exactly how it feels like to burn our people.\n\tWe were at war with the ANC.  We did barbaric things because we were at war.  We wanted them to go through the same pain as we did.  We drained petrol from the car, we came back and we burnt him.  We left.  Because we had difficulty siphoning the petrol from the small petrol pump in the engine, we realised that it would not succeed because we didn't have enough petrol from the small petrol pump in the engine.\n\tThat was for the first time that we burnt a person, and we never did it again.  We realised that because there were not enough fumes to really burn him, we just left.  I later learnt that there are certain things that one would have to do to ensure that a body burns completely, like throwing soil over the body.  This I had not known about and I did not even know or learn about it during my training at the Caprivi.\n\tWe left him there and we left.  After some time, I was arrested for the same murder.  Romeo was the first to be arrested and after a month, or within a month, I too was arrested.  That was the first case that took us to jail, not the others.\n\tI suppose everybody knows the details of the case, and we were sentenced for that murder because we took Nathi from Brickfield and brought him here against his will.  We were charged for kidnapping and I was sentenced for five years for kidnapping, and for killing him, I was then sentenced to 25 years.\n\tBut it was indicated that I would serve me term concurrently, that simply means the five years was included within the 25 years, and it would therefore become 25 years for killing Nathi.\n\tI am still serving the sentence at the Westville prison.",

I used to go there sometimes either for information or I would sometimes go there, sit down and drink.\n\tAs I was doing that, as usual, one person by the name of Nmbula said you think we are fools, we don't know what you are.  We know exactly what you are, you cannot fool us.\n\tYou mislead us.  We know how dangerous you are to us, and you make yourself a brave person by coming to our place.  We started arguing, because I, myself, had already taken some few beers and we quarrelled and we ended up fighting literally, by fists.\n\tHe is quite a hefty person, maybe heftier than I am.  He too, was drunk.  The problem started, I had my 9 mm pistol and I saw everybody now coming forward as if they were surrounding me.\n\tI rushed to withdraw my pistol and everybody had now their hands on my pistol, which was still in my body.  There was a struggle with my gun, which ultimately came out of my holster, and as the barrel of the pistol faced up, I don't know what happened exactly, but there was somebody who pulled the trigger.\n\tA bullet went off, but fortunately the barrel had faced up.  I would not just let go of my gun like that, and everybody stepped away, frightened by the gunfire.  I took the pistol and threw it to a boy who was called Skedi and I threw the pistol to him.  Skedi received the pistol and I hit Membula with my fist.  He hit me back, I fell face up.\n\tI picked myself up and I was now fighting with fear because I knew that I was all alone there, all these people were within the same group.  I was hesitant to hit him properly with my fist, because if I did so, I feared I might end up in trouble.\n\tWhat annoyed me, what really annoyed me was that I realised that the people who were trying to set us apart, were actually not trying to separate us.  And as I was being separated, they were giving Membula a chance to hit me, which he did.\n\tI got furious because ... (tape ends) ... I left the place and Gundani made his car available to take me home, and somebody was provided to drive me home.\n\tThere was also a lady with whom we used to have a fling, and I did not want to give them any indication that I was furious.  I was actually so furious about the fact that they were pretending to help and yet they were not.  I now had these bulges, a bulging face and I knew that the person would not beat me if there were two of us.\n\tOn arriving at my place, I spoke to Ali.  He has a green Skyline.  I requested him to take me to J2 to Romeo.  He took me together with this lady who was to be dropped at HY where she resided.\n\tWe went to Romeo's place.  What God in heaven has written is such that it is known that I did not go to Romeo's place to accompany me back so that we can shoot the people.  It is known that every man who gets beaten, can get angry.  I only went to Romeo so that I too can have my own people and Membula already had his own people, and we should be given a chance as men, so that we can fight using our own fists.\n\tAlso I had a chance to shoot Membula at the time, but I took the pistol which was loaded and threw it to Skedi who received it and I proceeded fighting with my fists.\n\tI did not try to shoot him.   I then arrived at Romeo's place in J2, I knocked, they opened the door.  I then told them about the whole story.  I then asked them to return with me to this place, because I wasn't afraid of this person and he wouldn't really defeat me, but I was also tipsy.",

Saying that we would not succeed today, we should come inside the house and he would show us.\n\tWe eventually managed to kick the door open, both the back and front doors and we fired.  His wife emerged, carrying a baby on her back.  We stopped firing and the wife passed us and she went to the neighbours.\n\tThen we advanced into the house.  I then remembered that we had not parked the car properly, it was in front of the gate.  As the gunshots were going off, I thought that the neighbours would look out and see the car and take the registration numbers.\n\tI then told the other guys that I was going back to the car but they should continue.  I got into the car and I told the driver to move off.

            "We looked for him that night because Captain Langeni on the phone was very angry, he was concerned about the damage that this would have on the image of the organisation.  This would have very bad political repercussions and we undertook to look for him.  He wanted him dead before the end of the day.\n\tWe looked for him until we came across him at the main road next to the College.  He was actually headed towards his home, and we were moving towards the opposite direction.  We made a U-turn and followed him.\n\tThere was myself, Romeo and (indistinct) Matenywawya in the vehicle in which we were travelling.  On following him we realised that he was headed for his place and we took a different road whilst he proceeded straight ahead towards a school that was painted yellowish, a school that taught people sewing.\n\tHe proceeded on that road because that is where his house was, and we took the road to our right and met him ahead.  (Indistinct) Matenywa offered that he was going to shoot him and we indicated to him that he is armed, you will not be in the position to do it and he insisted that he would shoot him.\n\tWe asked him what certainty he has and he said he would wish to be given a chance.  We knew that he was very good with firearms but unfortunately he had only five bullets.  We tried to give him another pistol, but he wanted this one particular AK47 that had five bullets.\n\tWhen we reversed, there is these electricity transmitters, the ones that you find in the streets, (indistinct) Matenywa himself was shot and he hid himself behind one of these electric transmitters, the one that was just next to Sergeant Khumalo's gate and Sergeant Khumalo would have to park at the gate and wait for the gate to be open and (indistinct) hid himself behind this electric transmitter.\n\tWe proceeded, dropped Matenywa and came back and went back to the school, parked the car at the school to which I referred earlier and we walked back, approaching and as we were approaching, we heard gunshots, single shots were being fired.\n\tOn shooting him, he did not give him a chance to withdraw his own and as Sergeant Khumalo was still waiting for the gate to be opened, there came two men.  They seemed to be from the same family, the Mabiga family and as the other one was getting nearer to Sergeant Khumalo, who was still sitting inside the car holding the steering wheel, Mabiga approached to speak to Khumalo.\n\t(Indistinct) Matenywa started shooting when Sergeant Khumalo was shooting to this Mabiga person, and the other one was standing at a distance.  As Matenywa was shooting it hit Khumalo and Mabiga.  Both of them were hit.\n\tThe aim was not to shoot Mabiga, but instead to shoot Khumalo.  I had also lost control because we were still approaching, we were not within the immediate place so that I was not in the position to say this is not the opportune time to shoot because we have a second person on the scene.\n\tBefore I arrived on the scene, he started shooting.  Sergeant Khumalo did not exchange fire, he had two firearms, a pistol and a rifle, and he was still talking to Mabiga and as a result he just died there in the car.\n\tMatenywa ran away towards our direction and we too were at the kind of direction where Matenywa was on the other side of the electricity transmitter and we just stood there.  We did not even get nearer, but yes, indeed the two of them were shot that way.",

His aim to come to Mrs Mbuyasi's place at that time was so that arrangements can be made to call me to rush to his place at Nyoni to assist.  He is a Chief at Nyoni.  He also indicated to me that there is one person in the area who was a bus driver and I am just thinking that there must be some place where I am confusing the surname.  I cannot differentiate the surname as to whether he was Myale or Mbanza, but I think one of these is his surname.\n\tThe Chief indicated that this person was problematic in his area, because this person would make sure that the drivers were divided into two.  There was this UWUSA group that was in loggerheads with COSATU.  UWUSA itself was formed by Inkatha, formed by Chief Mangosuthu so that if a driver belonged to UWUSA he would therefore be a member of Inkatha, and if a driver was on the side of COSATU he would automatically be associated with the ANC.\n\tThere was a problem because there was this unionism and it became a problem, there came a time when these people started fighting one another, some died and this person was alleged to recruiting people to COSATU leaving UWUSA and therefore this would mean that the organisation was losing support by so doing.\n\tHe further indicated that this person was organising people so that when they were going to a meeting, a conference at Ulundi they were attacked on their way going via Nyoni.  Such busses would be attacked on their way to Ulundi.\n\tOne person who was alleged to be behind everything was this very same person.
