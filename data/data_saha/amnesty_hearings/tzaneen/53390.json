On my right is Judge Khampepe.  Judge Khampepe is a member of the Amnesty Committee and she is attached to the Cape Court.  On my left is Advocate Bosman, also a member of the Amnesty Committee, also from the Cape, and I am Selwyn Miller, Judge from the Eastern Cape attached to the Transkei Division of the High Court.\n\tThese proceedings will be simultaneously translated, and in order to benefit from the translation you have to be in possession of one of these devices.

And then he told the policeman at the gate that he wanted to report a case and then the policeman opened the gate.\n\tAt that time if I could just explain to the Commission the entire police force was actually warned that all members of the police force at that particular time should keep all their gates and doors of the police stations securely locked.  So at the time when this person arrived the gate was locked, and at the request of this person the policeman opened the gate and this person entered into the police station and then when he was inside the police station he told the sergeant, the charge office sergeant behind the counter, that he was assaulted by someone. Now when the sergeant wanted to obtain a statement from him he then opened his coat, unbuttoned his coat and then took out an AK47 and started shooting at the police station, at the policemen.\n\tTwo policemen were fatally wounded there and then the gas bottles in the charge office which caught fire, and some dockets which were lying in the storeroom also caught fire and then the whole charge office was engulfed in fire.  \n\tOne policeman who was outside was shot at by two other people who were also armed with AK47's.  And then he was also fatally wounded.  He eventually left the police force because he was medically unfit to perform his duties. Those two other policemen were burnt to ashes inside the charge office.  An RPG7 was used too, to finish up the charge office.",

I personally had a moral obligation to see to either the suspects or the victims should be properly handled by the interrogators.\n\tMy failure I think has also contributed a lot to the conditions in which these people found themselves during the interrogation and I am deeply sorry that I allowed these thing to carry on like that, and I also physically assaulted one of these victims.  \n\tYou know looking at what happened to me after that I think people would be able to realise how deeply sorry I was.  \n\tMr Chair, I was the Deputy Commander of the Security Branch until I was transferred on the instruction of the President then, President Mpepu to go and be Chief of Staff of the Venda Defence Force in 1985, and then I went through a number of courses in the defence force.  Eventually I ended up as the appointed Chief of Defence Force, the Deputy Chief of Defence Force and I has to proceed again on other courses until in 1990 with the release of Mandela, President Mandela, and that I also got involved in a military coup d'etat in Venda.  I took over Venda and I tried everything at my disposal then to reconcile the people of Venda with those who were the enemies of Venda.  I built the Venda people and united them and brought in the spirit of reconciliation.  \n\tWhen we were due to represent Venda at Codesa and later on at multi-party conference I made sure that all people from all spheres of life, especially those in Venda, are nominated to sit with me at Codesa and multi-party talks. I took, amongst the victims here, Dean Farisani, he was one of my delegation.  To me this is a sign of reconciliation.  It is a sign that says forget about the past, let's build a new South Africa together.  \tI am the first homeland leader to host the first internal conference of MK.  We were fighting against MK in 1981 and '79 backwards.  But I found it necessary to gather them to come to Venda and host a conference, the MK conference.  \n\tI brought the various groupings within South Africa and Venda to come and discuss about quo vadis TBVC.  To look at what is going to happen to the TBVC States, because the future of these states were in the hands of who comes into power in the new South Africa, so I held a conference to discuss the future of these TBVC.  \n\tI was the first homeland leader to visit the MK headquarters in Lusaka.  The first conference of the TBVC, MK, SANDF was attended by me.  \n\tI was responsible for bringing about, for brokering the conference on enmity between the South African Defence Force, South African Police and APLA in Harare.  \n\tNow I can name a number of things that indicates you know, the change of attitude, the change of approach, the deepest felt apology that one could bring across.",
