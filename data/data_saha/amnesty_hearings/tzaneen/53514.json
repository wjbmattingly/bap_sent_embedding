After a lengthydebate a decision eventually was taken in January that the armed struggle hasgot to be stopped and therefore both the PAC and APLA had to be part and parcelof the process that was taking place.  Instructions were issued by the HighCommand, unfortunately we had a long structure in terms of the chain of command,so the instructions from the High Command were directed first and foremost tothe Director of Operations, and the Director of Operations in turn had to giveinstructions to the Regional Commanders and the Regional Commanders in turnhad to give instructions to the District Commanders, down until it reached thelowest levels, and this took a long time.  Not necessarily because it was along chain, but secondly we had to convince our cadres, like I am indicatingthat we had serious divisions in this regard.  Even ourselves before we couldtake that decision as the High Command, we were seriously divided, we had todebate over the issue until finally we had the majority that was for the decision,and amongst the cadres as well, there were those initially who opposed it andthis opposition was also reflected later on when we integrated into the DefenceForce.  Some of the members refused to integrate and we had to persuade themand the last group was only integrated last year, we are still continuing tomake an effort to make sure that even those who have not yet integrated, mustbecome part and parcel of the process.  I can assure you that we have made aneffort since 1994, even to date, if we can get an indication possibly that thereare some APLA members that are thinking differently from what the High Commandthought and the PAC thought initially, we will take it upon ourselves to makesure that they tow the line.",

We were sitting on the bed - may I just go back a littlebit, early that morning, just before I got up, the one dog who sleeps in thebedroom with us, there are two who sleeps in the bedroom, one dog rushed tothe window and barked.  I got up and I went to have a look, but I didn't seeanything.  Then later, I got up and washed and took my wife some tea in bedand while we were drinking tea, I was sitting on her side of the bed, and Ilooked out in the direction of which I would leave the house, I had alreadyput on my socks and shoes and I was weighing medicine for the chickens and Ithen left the house, it was about quarter past six in the morning.  In eachhand, I carried a little bowl of medication and approximately 15 metres fromthe front door, I heard a muttering.  There was a cement pond surrounded byflowers and I saw man standing, jumping up from the flowers and I actually thoughtit was one of my own labourers and I wondered why he was up so early, what hewas doing on our property so early because it wasn't yet time for work.  I openup the cages first thing in the morning and only then do the labourers arriveand the man approached me and said that I should halt.  As he approached me, Mr Thobejane also jumped up amongst the flower bed and when the first man wasabout five metres away from me, he aimed a pistol at me and when Mr Thobejanestood up, I saw that he had an AK47.  I then stood still, I first wanted torun and then the person with the pistol said I should stand still.  As I wasstill thinking what I was about to do, I took the two bowls of medicine andI bent forward and put it down on the path in front of me, he once again toldme to stand still.  He then told me to go back to the house and he pushed thepistol in the small of my back and we turned around and walked towards the house. Mr Thobejane walked next to us with the AK47 aimed at the dog, I have a StaffordshireTerrier dog who stays outside the house on the smallholding, and he kept thisweapon aimed at the dog.  At the door, the person with the pistol led me inthe direction of the room, we first entered into an entrance hall, we then turnedright into a passage and at the end of the passage, on the right hand side,is the main bedroom.  When I got to the bedroom door, I saw my wife standingin the middle of the room and I knew I had to do something.  I then jumped intothe room, and as I did so, I slammed the door shut, but as I did so, I hearda shot go off and it missed me by millimetres, it missed my arm.  As the doorbanged shut, my wife onto the floor in front of me.  I knew that she was dead. I stepped over her, I stepped over her body and went to my safe because I knewthat this was trouble.  Whilst I was standing in front of the safe to unlockit, shots were fired at me through the window from outside.  By the time I gotmy weapon out of the safe, I heard people shouting at each other outside andthen there was quiet.  I first looked out of the window to make sure if therewas anybody outside, there was nobody and then I went out, I left the houseand there was nobody outside.",

If they went there for robbery, it is mysubmission that I don't see any reason for them not to shoot their way throughthat door, and go and take whatever they wanted to take, if that was the case.\n        And alsoChairperson, the fact that the deceased had a firearm, it is clear though MrSwanepoel said the safe was locked, one - unfortunately, I didn't want to takehim through the events of the day because I could see that it is taking himback, but it is clear that definitely I suppose that also the firearm of thewife was kept in a safe, and it will be my submission that definitely, I don'tthink at that time, it was locked, the safe, as it was put here that he wastrying to open the safe at that time.

            "Yes, Mr Chairperson, I amafraid I still have to argue that point on the basis that if we are to believethe applicants, then the reason why they went to the farm was to kill the occupantsof the farm and as Mr Swanepoel testified, there was actually nothing that stoppedthem from actually killing him.  From that I deduct that it was possibly notthe motivation of these assailants to actually kill these people and that iswhy I deduct that there must have been another purpose to the attack.  I amnot prepared to argue this point much further and I leave it to the discretionof the Committee.\n        May I justadd another few factors which I consider to be pointers in the support of mytheory that they in fact went there to rob the place namely the fact that atthis stage the Committee have to accept that there is absolutely no basis onwhich they identified the target being a political target.  Mr Swanepoel testifiedthat he had actually no political affiliations, that he was definitely not amember of the AWB and that it was actually his livelihood to trade with blackpersons.  He definitely did not hate them.  If that motivation is then negated,it only leaves one other possibility and that is the fact that he was a farmer,a chicken farmer and I would suggest that it was then common knowledge thathe would have guns and a large amount of cash on the farm. \n        Secondly,Mr Swanepoel's evidence was quite direct on the point that they directed himto the bedroom where the safe was located.  He did not walk in that directionvoluntarily.  This points to the indication that the assailants, the applicants,had prior knowledge of where the guns and the cash would be kept in that house. I want to step off from that specific point and come to my learned friend'sargument that there was no material discrepancies between the versions of theapplicants.  Unfortunately Mr Chairman, I cannot accept that suggestion.  Iam of the opinion that at least for Mr Thobejane's part, I got the impressionthat he tried to make the case against him, or his involvement in that, in factas little as possible.  He fabricated a gun to be in the possession of the farmerwhen he walked out of the house.  I think there can be little doubt that therewas no gun at that stage.  He tried to put as much distance between himselfand the person who actually killed Mrs Swanepoel, he said he was preoccupiedby trying to shoot Mr Swanepoel in the circumstances, but had to concede thatit actually took place in the very same room, there was no different runningaway and shooting.  The two assailants were next to each other at the entranceof that specific main bedroom, that is the evidence of Mr Swanepoel and again,Mr Swanepoel testified, there was absolutely no reason why they did not actuallycarry out their, or why they couldn't carry out their mission, namely to shootthe both of them.  \n        To sum uptherefore, I would suggest that there was in fact attempts from the witness,specifically Mr Thobejane, not to put the real evidence before this forum, thathe in fact in that sense, failed to make a full disclosure.  Also referringto the involvement of a certain Jameson Baloyi which he admitted at a very latestage, and under cross-examination to be one of the persons harbouring theseassailants.",

Under cross-examination he admitted that hewon't dispute that it was not a gun.  So definitely if he was fabricating that,he would have stuck it out and said \"look, I don't care who says what,he was carrying a gun.\"\n        Coming tothe question of that, Chairperson, I would not go to the question that theydid not make out the question of political motivation because Mr Swanepoel wasnot a right-winger, he was not belonging to any political organisation, it hasbeen stressed that irrespective of what, the farmers were the targets.  Chairperson,I would like to come to this question of armed robbery.  I am sure I would beseen to be monotonous to the Committee, I have been arguing this question, theapplication in respect of the applicants.
