<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> Chairperson, I will ask the question I asked before this witness ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...[inaudible]</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> There is one last witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...[inaudible]</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> The idea is not to call any other witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Steenkamp, how many witnesses do you propose to call?</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Mr Chairman, it depends on the situation.  At this stage I have two witnesses Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What does it depend on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Well it doesn't depend on anything Mr Chairman, we'll definitely call them.  The problem is, we didn't prepare any sworn statements but we can call them.  There's a possibility of a third witness tomorrow morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> A third witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Yes, Sir, but the definitely the two witnesses are available, they can testify immediately.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The evidence that your witnesses are intending to give, is ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Well the first two witnesses, yes, Mr Chairman.  The third witness will probably deal with the facts of the incident itself, at the day of the incident.  The Security Branch police officer will probably come before.  The ...[indistinct] will make a sworn statement if necessary.  We're waiting for him but there is a request from the victims to testify, two victims.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So what we're talking about is actually a maximum of three witnesses and one applicant tomorrow?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a>Perhaps we can dispose of your last applicant now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> As it pleases the Committee.  Chairperson, the next and last applicant is Mr Molwedi Mokoena.  He is before you now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mokoena, what language would you prefer to use?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> I will answer for him whilst he is still ...[indistinct].  He also, like we indicated earlier, will use English.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MOLWEDI MOKOENA:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Koopedi, where is Mr Mokoena's ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">ADV STEENKAMP:</span> Page 8 until 20, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I see his personal particulars are already set out in his application so you can skip those and get to the nitty gritty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR KOOPEDI:</span> As it pleases the Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a>	Is it true that you are one of the applicants in  this matter and further that you are a member of the Johannes Nkosi Unit which was based in the East Rand?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> Yes, I was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> Now would you, very briefly so, inform the members of this Committee when you joined the ANC and in particular what training you had?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a>MR MOKOENA</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a>"I joined the African National Congress and its armed wing Umkhonto weSizwe in 1986 internally(?).  I became a member of the regional command, Johannes Nkosi Unit, between 1987 and 1990.  I received military and combat training in the former Soviet Union, Botswana, Zambia and Zimbabwe"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> Now the offences for which you are here before this Committee, would you, for the sake of the record, state the offences for which you are applying for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> I firstly say I engaged in the following in my personal capacity</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a>1)	The bombing and electrical sub-station near Katlehong Station with fellow applicant, Alfas Ndlovu.</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a>2)	Bombing of the sewerage tanks in the Sunwatt Park with fellow applicant, Ernest Sigasa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a>And as part of the overall command, the Johannes Nkosi, I'm applying for the following:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a>1)	Bombing of the "Kitskonstabels" Barracks in Mnisi Section.</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a>2)	The bombing of - the ambush of the "Kitskonstabels" and SAP in Motsamai Section next to Lindela Hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a>3)	The bombing of Wimpy Bar.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a>4)	And the bombing of the bus terminus in Germiston.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> Now when all these offences were committed, or in fact prior to that, were you involved in any way in the planning thereof?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> Yes, I was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> Now you have explained or mentioned the offences for which you are applying for amnesty, would you briefly tell the Members of this Honourable Committee what you did on that day, how you went about executing those acts?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> ...[inaudible] and on the electrical sub-section, and we placed the mini limpet mine on the railway line, the intersection of the railway lines. 	And the next thing we only got reports from the newspaper.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> With regards to the main sewerage tank in Sunwatt Park?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> With regard to the main sewerage tank in Sunwatt Park, we moved from our base again together with fellow applicant, Mr Ernest Sigasa.  We used one of our vehicles, which is somewhere identified as part of our support service to the place in Sunwatt Park.  It was in the evening between 8 and 9.  We went for those sewerage tanks which were a bit further away from the residential place and we placed our mines, and it happened like in the very first case, that we had to get the report from the newspapers of the explosion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR KOOPEDI:</span> That is all for now Mr Chairperson, from me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR KOOPEDI</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can you just run by the incidents that you apply for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> I think are two-phased, the specific ones that I applied, wherein I was physically involved and which is the bombing of the railway line and electrical sub-station near Katlehong, and the bombing of the sewerage tanks in Sunwatt Park.  And the rest are as my part as component member of the Johannes Nkosi Unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Which events are you talking about in respect of that now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> It's - say for instance, the bombing of the "Kitskonstabels", which my fellow applicants ...[intervention]</p>
