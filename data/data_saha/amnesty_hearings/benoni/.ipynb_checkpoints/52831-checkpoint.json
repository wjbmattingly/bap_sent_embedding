            "Please proceed.\nMR SIGASA\n\"I, Ernest Phumuzi Sigasa, born on the 4th of June 1965 joined the African National Congress and its armed wing, Umkhonto weSizwe in 1984.  I became the commander of the Regional Command Structure, Johannes Nkosi Unit, between 1987 to 1990.  I received my military training and combat training in Botswana, Zimbabwe and the former Soviet Union.  Johannes Nkosi Unit was constituted by the following combatants:  myself, Ernest Sigasa, overall commander of the unit, combat name Happy. My responsibilities were overall command, clearance of the DLB's, the guidance to military activities, to communicate with the front command of Botswana and the military headquarters, Lusaka and Zambia and also to execute armed attacks.  The other fellow applicant, Tebogo Kebotlhale, the Commissar of the Regional Command Structure, combat name, Bernard.  His responsibilities were to do political work within the unit to train and distribute arms in our various sub-units, clearance of the DLB's, executing attacks and sustain the moral of the unit members.  Alfas Ndlovu, fellow applicant, a member of the Command Structure, combat name Ambros.  Responsibilities was to train armed units in the various areas, execute attacks and he was also a principal tactician, a military tactician in the unit.  Molwedi Mokoena, fellow applicant, combat name, Bensaramos.  He was responsible for the overall welfare of the unit.  He served as the principal fund-raiser for the unit.  He trained armed units, he executed attacks and his also responsibility was a politico military analyst in the unit.  Gift(?) Sephras Mkomezulu, though late, member as well, combat name, Press.  His responsibilities were to train arm units, execute attacks and he was also the military tactician in the unit.\n\t\tJohannes Nkosi, the person, was born in 1905 and joined the Communist Party at the age of 19.  He was assassinated on Dingaan's Day, 1930, during the burning campaign, past burning campaign.  He was shot at point blank, stabbed and beaten to death by a chief police constable.  No policeman was ever punished for his assassination.  He was a true veteran Trade Unionist, a seasoned communist from the countryside.  \n\t\tOur unit was impressed with his selfless devotion to the liberation struggle, hence the unit was named after him, Johannes Nkosi.  The composition of Johannes Nkosi Unit was characterised by the proven record of involvement of members traced from the Congress of South African Students, COSAS, the youth organisation during the '80's.\n\t\tJohannes Nkosi Unit members involvement in the mass democratic movement, championed by the United Democratic Front was in various capacities as members and activists and leaders.  This informed their political readiness to serve in MK.  Proven leadership and political consciousness was the fundamental criterion characterising membership to Johannes Nkosi Unit\"\n\tThe structure of Johannes Nkosi Unit, it is in page 4 in the bundle of files, the organogram of our structure.\n\"The political situation then, the mid-80's was characterised by the heightened activity by liberation movements against illegitimate regime.  The apartheid regime had launched a brutal campaign of repression and suppression against all the people, both the black and white, urban and rural, rich and poor, unionised and non-unionised, who were bent on bringing down apartheid machinery through participation in the ranks of the people's organisations, civics, Trade Unions, youths, students and many more other progressive organisations.\n\t\tThe occupation of the townships by the then SADF meant that the apartheid regime was clearly gearing itself for unleashing its might on an unarmed and defenceless people.  The occupation of the African townships such as Sebokeng, Katlehong, Duduza and others necessitated an urgent need from the side of the African National Congress, ANC, through Umkhonto weSizwe to defend the people against this occupation.\n\t\tThe occupation by the then SADF of our schools, churches and sports fields was a calculated attempt by the apartheid regime to capitulate the masses of the people and cause a hole to the struggle for liberation. The occupation was a desperate response by the regime in order to save face in the light of the successes made by Umkhonto weSizwe, MK. \n\t\tThe call by President Tambo, the late President Tambo of the African National Congress,  comrade Tambo, I quote: \n\t'Render the country ungovernable and apartheid unworkable'.  That was the January 8th statement of 1985, had been met with positive revolutionary responses by the majority of people in South Africa.  To mention but a few, in 1984 school boycotts in the East Rand, the local government elections in August '84, the national strike by the National Union of Mine Workers, the rent boycotts in Sebokeng, Duduza, Sakane and other townships.  At that time the front-lying states as well were under constant cross-border raids conducted by the racists commandos as a result of the intensification of the armed struggle in the country.  The country was in a general state of war.\n\t\tThe Johannes Nkosi Unit was born out of the circumstantial realities of the time.  The Johannes Nkosi Unit was established henceforth to lead our combat groups against apartheid tyranny.  We believed that the seeds of people's war were now charred by tribulations of mass struggles waged by the people of South Africa.  And believing that, the armed struggle was integral component part of a broad political process towards liberation of South Africa.\n\t\tThe Johannes Nkosi Unit emerged to reinforce those struggles through increased armed activities and the revolutionary propaganda, to marshal revolutionary forces into war for freedom, peace and democracy in our country.\n\t\tThe strategic importance of Johannes Nkosi.  The East Rand region as an economic powerhouse in the province and the country was an ideal and strategic place to launch an accelerated armed struggle.  The East Rand region through its multitudes of industries occupied and served as the nerve centre of the apartheid economy.  As an industrial and economic giant through levies, taxes, rates, wealth created, subsidised and maintained apartheid regime. \n\t\tThe East Rand region, due to its economic progress as part of the broader campaign to weaken an cut the resource base of apartheid regime was eventually targeted as an ideal place for armed struggle, championed by the ANC's armed military wing, Umkhonto weSizwe.\n\t\tPolitical turmoil in the East Rand.  During the second half of the '80's and countrywide informed the origin of the Johannes Nkosi Unit.  Furthermore, the whole country was in fire.  Umkhonto weSizwe and the masses of the people, organised by the mass democratic movement, were engaged in fierce battles with apartheid regime.  It is during this period when killings, detentions, torture and displacement of ...[indistinct] was experienced across the line of fire.\n\t\tThe emergence of Johannes Nkosi Unit in the East Rand was due to political conditions existing countrywide and particularly in the region.  A need to build popular armed forces, a need to consolidate armed activities in terms of quality and number in order to salvage the people's war and finally to galvanise the support of the people and the international community through armed propaganda activities expressed in the operations executed by our forces to ensure that total isolation and the defeat of apartheid is realised.\n\t\tOur sub-units.  Johannes Nkosi Unit trained, armed and led people to battle, the combat units in various locations in the region.  These sub-units were ordered to deliver a heavy blow to the bogus municipal elections in 1988 and the security personnel.  The following operations illustrate the extent of the blow unleashed by one of our combat units under our command, Baizel February based in Duduza.  There was a blowing of a police van in Duduza with a limpet mine.  There was a blowing of the administration block in kwaThema with a limpet mine.  The sabotage of electrical sub-station in De Notre with a limpet mine.  The blowing of a post office in Nigel with a limpet mine.  Despite the difficulty to locate other units under our command and keeping their records of operations, we however salute those sub-units.  \n\t\tThe brief or the mandate to Johannes Nkosi Unit.  Our brief was to train, arm and lead the people into battle.  It was also to defend out people, to severe the enemy lines of communications and power.  To disperse and immobilise the enemy forces.  To destroy the enemy's economic resources.  To attack the enemy on all fronts and ...[indistinct] its forces.  To make a people's war flourish in its dimensions in every part of our country.\n\t\tOur modus operandi.  Our modus operandi was planning, execution and control and the support services.  On planning.  We met every Wednesday in a plannery to analyse, review and take decisions on our actions.  \n\tOn execution.  We retrieved the dead letter boxes, we trained various sub-units, we conducted reconnaissance, we distributed arms in various sub-units in the East Rand, we issued out combat orders, we executed armed actions.\n\t\tOn control.  We received reports from units, we visited units to ascertain welfare and needs, we monitored arms in their possession.  On the support services.  We had links with the mass democratic movement leadership, we owned two vehicles, we also had underground houses.  \n\t\tOperations.  The context of the operations.  The nature of the operations carried out by Johannes Nkosi Unit ranged from the point of qualifying the elaborate position of number one, to attack the enemy security personnel, to accelerate armed propaganda, hitting the economic infrastructure of the system.\n\t\tThe least of our operations:  Johannes Nkosi Command Structures Operations.  \n\t1)  We bombed the ...[indistinct] Barracks in Mnisi section.  It was carried out by my fellow applicant, Tebogo Kebotlhale and Alfas Ndlovu.  \n\t2)  The bombing of the sewerage pipes in Sunwatt Park, Boksburg, it was by myself, Ernest Sigasa and my fellow applicant, Molwedi Mokoena.  \n\tThe ambush of \"Kitskonstabels\" and the SAP Motsamai Section in Ndela hostel, it was myself and my fellow applicant, Alfas Ndlovu.  \n\t3)  The bombing of Wimpy, Benoni, it was carried out by my fellow applicant, Alfas Ndlovu.  \n\t4)  The bombing of railway line and the sub-station, electrical sub-station next to Katlehong Station, it was carried out by Alfas Ndlovu and Molwedi Mokoena.  \n\t5)  The bus terminus in Germiston, it was carried out by Tebogo Kebotlhale.  \n\t\tWe now classify our operations as follows:  The electrical sub-station in Katlehong - The bombing of the electrical sub-station in Katlehong which powers the railway services between Germiston and Katlehong areas was to signify the vulnerability of apartheid economic system.  The electrical sub-station serves as a reliable means to effect transportation at the benefit of apartheid rules, as part of the broader transportation network.  The bombing of electrical sub-station came on the eve of the stay-away campaign called by the Mass Democratic Movement.  For us to support struggling masses of the people, the progressive organisations and undermining the apartheid economy, the electrical sub-station became the target.  For us to disrupt and support the stay-away, we had to render trade services of use.  In summary, the electrical sub-station blast in Katlehong signified the passion the Johannes Nkosi Unit had in supporting the progressive forces which engaged the enemy despite limited means.\n\t\tThe Johannes Nkosi Unit attacked the electrical sub-station to support the stay-away planned by the progressive organisations in the townships.  The Johannes Nkosi Unit attacked the electrical sub-station in order to engrave in the minds of the people in South Africa, that MK is with them and MK is everywhere.  That action served as an armed propaganda tactic as well.\n\t\tWimpy Bar.  Wimpy Bar was not the target at first, the actual target was the notorious Security Branch headquarters in Benoni next to Benoni Railway Station.  The extensive and constant information sought through reconnaissance led to Wimpy Bar attack.  Our reports and information as a result indicated that most of the Special Branch personnel frequented the place before and after their notorious crusade of activities in the townships and elsewhere.\n\t\tWimpy Bar which is several metres from this Special Branch headquarters became the target.  To us Wimpy Bar was an ideal place to attack the security personnel where they least expected.  Furthermore, it was to mark the 67th anniversary of the South African Communist Party which was on the 30th of July.\n\t\tFurthermore, guided by the revolutionary call of the leadership, in particular the late Chief of Staff of Umkhonto weSizwe, comrade Chris Hani, I quote:\n\t'That we must turn the white areas into battle zones because there's a popular war for total liberation in this country'.\n\t\tIn summary.  Wimpy Bar in Benoni was bombed in line with the principles of attacking the enemy security personnel as legitimate targets and the revolutionary armed propaganda intended to cultivate the spirit of rebellion and the frame of mind which puts the politics of the revolutionary change to the fore.  That was also a statement by comrade President, the late President Tambo on the January 8th statement, 73rd anniversary of the ANC.\n\t\tThe bus terminus blast in Germiston.  The bombing of the bus terminus in Germiston was carried with the sole purpose of furthering the revolutionary armed propaganda.  The bus terminus was practically for white persons use in Germiston. The bus terminus was observed and reconnoitred over a period of time.  The outcome of the reconnaissance revealed that it is only busy during peak hours of the morning, roughly between from 7 up to 10 in the morning.  The bombing was time for 12 o'clock and during that time the place is deserted.  Hence it was placed consciously at a time when there are no people around.  They were done in order to cause confusion.  Despite the fact that it was an all white bus terminus we did not aim to attack those white civilians.  \n\t\tThe bus terminus bombing in Germiston was not an attack on the whites but an armed propaganda tactic.  In its planning and execution of the operation, Johannes Nkosi embraced the message on the white civilians' life as elaborated by the late President, comrade OR Tambo, I quote:\n\t'We have not been avoiding hitting whites as whites, there was no policy of hitting buildings instead of whites, no whites instead of buildings.  This is not a distinction that we have been making. If we have made any distinction it has been to avoid hitting people'\n\t\tThe bombing of the bus terminus in Germiston was planned in line with the zeal to spread revolutionary armed propaganda and extend the war into greater heights in the region.  \n\t\tThe ambush on policemen.  The Kitts Constable, the Municipal Police known as the \"Kitskonstabels\", came to ...[indistinct] at a time of the state of emergency declared on the 21st July 1985 by the ex-Law and Order Minister, Louis le Grange.  The Municipal Police in various townships in the East Rand engaged in most brutal attacks on the community.  They enforced curfew with much more abhorable arrogance ever shown by the racist Security Forces in the country.  \n\t\tThey collaborated an action with the riot police, the then SADF and the councillors, to extinguish the flames of war and to abort the cause of liberation struggle.  The Municipal Police, due to their geographic deployment in townships, were always the first of the enemy security machinery to be in touch with the popular activities of struggling, waged by the communities.  In all cases they crushed these activities with a brute force ever unleashed by other enemy Security Forces, that is the then SAP, the then SADF.\n\t\tFor us, Municipal Police represented part of the security machinery of the apartheid regime.  The defeat of the enemy plans to abort the struggle for liberation in our country depended on the cleansing and the elimination of all those cohorts in the apartheid regime's payroll.  \n\t\tThe Municipal Police as the security apparatus of the apartheid regime equally as the other agencies became the legitimate target for our unit.  It was about time that the armed offensive was directed against the Municipal Police.  In our minds they constituted the last blow of the security agency that was created to suppress the ...[indistinct] wave of mass resistance against  apartheid colonial ...[indistinct] forces.\n\t\tIt was also important for us, in order to deter and discourage the people from joining the enemy ranks which was heavily infiltrated, which has heavily infiltrated our communities through some 007 types, spies, informers, collaborators, at the point in questions.\n\t\tIn summary, the attack on the Municipal Police in Motsamai Section, Ndela Hostel was a legitimate target act of defending our communities against the savage attacks of apartheid regime.\n\t\tThe Municipal Police never hesitated to unleash systematic violence against the fighters for the people's cause.  They fanned fratricidal conflict amongst the people in order to ensure the perpetration of apartheid system, from which they benefited.\n\t\tThe late ANC President, comrade OR Tambo called, I quote:\n\t'The offensive against apartheid system must be extended to reach Bantustan and other apartheid institutions in all corners of the country, among all population groups'.  That also is the 73rd anniversary of the ANC, 1985.\n\t\tJohannes Nkosi Unit rose to the occasion to deliver telling blows against the apartheid system and their puppets who have denounced the people by defending the people's enemy.  \n\t\tThe contribution.  We saw our struggle as part and parcel of a contribution by other MK cadres.  The time has come therefore when we should dip the revolutionary banner in honouring the memories of our fellow martyrs, like comrade Izak Mokoena, Gift Mtaung, Aubrey Nkosi and many others.  The unsung heroes and heroines of our struggle.\n\t\tWe want to say that today the heroic work of our people's army goes on.  The new dispensation, democracy, nation building and the healing process testimonised the noble ideas of instituting a new South Africa, united democratic in nature.  The time has come when we should extend gratitude and appreciation to all those MK forces who made the spear more sharper and precise in line with the slogan: \"Every combatant a patriot and every patriot a combatant\".  It is through their blood and sweat that South Africa is a free united democratic in nature.\n\t\tOur address to yourselves, the Commissioners.  The Johannes Nkosi Unit takes this opportunity to appreciate work done by the TRC and the role it has played in bringing about reconciliation and healing our ghastly past.  We feel very much gratified for been afforded an opportunity by the TRC to tell the truth.  It is our firm belief that through our actions we have in one way or the other contributed to the establishment of a democratic dispensation.  And it is those actions which in a way contributed to the establishment of the TRC as an important vehicle excavating the true history of South Africa.\n\t\tIt is also our firm belief that even the Commissioners and the supporting staff have at one point or the other in their lives cherished an ideal South African society in which democracy reigns supreme and that the rule of ordinary law of the land applied.  It is that kind of society for which we ourselves risked our lives for the preservation of life itself.\n\t\tAddress to victims if they are present in this hall.  It has never been our intention to deliberately kill and injure ordinary people.  It was not our intention to be sitting with you in the hearing like this.  Our actions were not specially directed to you and your families.  It has however happened within the context of escalating armed activities that we sit here today and that you happened to be caught in that cross-fire.  We do not pretend that pain and all sorts of inconveniences have not been suffered by yourselves as a result of our actions, but it is within the context of the intensification and escalating armed struggle that some of you fell victims.\n\t\tWe also wish to bring to your attention, the Commission and the sundry, that you are not the only victims.  In a way we are also victims of circumstances which prevailed then.  Those activities have affected us tremendously to an extent that we need some kind of help of sort specialised counselling.\n\t\tIt is also with the aforegoing reasons and circumstances that we appeal to victims to understand our actions within that context.  We also make a humble request to all victims to accept our application for amnesty.  We acknowledge without any hesitation the trauma you have suffered and undergone as a result of our actions.  We know there has been pain and suffering and we hereby extend our hand of reconciliation.  \n\t\tWe are convinced and hold a firm belief that all of these activities were carried out in pursuit of the political objectives of the ANC and its armed wing, Umkhonto weSizwe.  These actions were intended to bolster the moral of South Africans, to mobilise them and enhance their revolutionary zeal and participation in the liberation struggle.\n\t\tThe other objective as mentioned elsewhere in this application was also to create conditions for a general revolutionary climate and demoralise and confuse enemy forces, police and army personnel.  Having said that, I present myself and my co-applicants, comrades, members of our unit, before yourselves to be considered for amnesty.  I thank you\".",
