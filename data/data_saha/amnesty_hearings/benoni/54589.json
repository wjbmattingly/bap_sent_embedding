These statements were made after the unbanning of the South African Communist Party.  My actions created the perception that I might not be able to act impartially in the current application.  It is of the greatest importance that the activities of the Amnesty Committee would not only be wholly impartial, but that it should also be perceived to be entirely impartial by the public at large.   The Committee must at all times act with integrity and impartiality and it should be perceived by the public to be such.\n\tIn view of the preceding I consider it my responsibility to recuse myself from this hearing.\n\tDuring 1990 I laid a charge with the Police to investigate certain remarks of the late Mr Hani.  This was after the unbanning of the South African Communist Party.  This led to the perception that I wouldn't be in a position to make an unbiased decision in the present application.  It is of the utmost importance that the Amnesty Committee should not only act with absolute impartiality but that it should also be seen by all South Africans as a Committee acting with integrity and impartiality.

            "We have an application to make to the Committee Mr Chairperson for a postponement.  You are no doubt in receipt of an affidavit filed by us setting out the reasons and a lengthier document from the applicants' representatives headed \"Heads of Argument\", indicating that they will oppose that application.\n\tBefore proceeding with the application and as a necessary preliminary step, in view of what the applicants say in what they call Heads of Argument suggesting that we are really seeking time to no good purpose, I consider it our duty to put before the Committee what it is that we intend trying to prove before you in order that you may more reasonably assess what they say and weigh it against what we have to say as to why this postponement is required by us.\n\tFirst of all there are no pleadings in this case and therefore it will be necessary for us to indicate to you what we believe the main issues are going to be in order to motivate the application for a postponement.\n\tThere are four main grounds which we want to inform you, Mr Chairperson and members of the Committee, on the basis on which you will be asked to refuse this application.\n\tThe first is that the applicants did not make full disclosure either at the trial where they were convicted, or in their amnesty applications, more particularly in relation to the role played by others, and more particularly Mrs Derby-Lewis.  We will show that her evidence at that trial was false, and that the instructions given by the applicants to their Counsel to put questions to her were based on an untruthful version.\n\tThe second ground is that they did not act on behalf of or on the order of any known political organisation.  And that we will show by the production of documents, if need be oral evidence, that they falsely allege that they acted on behalf of the Conservative Party.  Indeed evidence will be led that the leaders of the Conservative Party distanced themselves from the killing perpetrated by the two applicants.\n\tThe third ground is that their admitted motive was to create chaos.  This makes, we will submit, having regard to what happened, and having regard to the efforts that the leadership of the ANC, the South African Communist Party, COSATU, and many other men and women of good will, from preventing the chaos that came about as the result of the assassination of the late Chris Hani.  And for someone to kill a leader of an organisation who was at the time actively engaged in the reconciliation process in order to bring about a democratic election and a democratic South Africa is completely disproportionate to the objective which they wanted to achieve.\n\tIn their most recent amendment they introduce another ground, no doubt picked up, we will submit eventually, from other applications that it was in order to kill military targets.  So the introduction, we submit, that the late Chris Hani was a military target and that is why they chose to assassinate him, is false, partially because the assassination took place after the suspension of the armed struggle and during the period of negotiations that were well-advanced at that time.\n\tThose are the issues which we believe will be the main issues and other subsidiary reasons as to why amnesty should not be granted.\n\tMr Chairperson and members of the Committee, the documents put by the applicants before you consist, in the main, from cuttings from Die Patriot and the letters of one Ada Parker.  There is evidence in the documents themselves and evidence will have to be led, that this is a circular position that the wife of the first applicant, Mr Derby-Lewis, was in fact the author of many of the articles that have been put before the Committee and this attempt to pull oneself up by one's own shoestrings is hardly admissible, but evidence will have to be led in relation to what the correct position was.\n\tNow I want to turn to the affidavit that we have filed in support of the application for a postponement.  In paragraph 3 Mrs Caroline Nicholls says,\n\"I have been instructed by Mrs Hani to apply for a postponement as she has to go to the United States for personal reasons and will be unavailable for the hearing\".\nThere are, however, further reasons.  \n\tLet me deal with this reason.  Much is made in the applicants' heads of argument that Mrs Hani does not give details of what her personal reasons are.  Mrs Hani is leaving for the United States this evening.  She is in the auditorium.  I would strongly urge the Committee, because there are so many cogent grounds why a postponement is to be granted, that Mrs Hani should not have to explain publicly the reason, the personal reason for which she has to go to America where her daughter is.  Her husband's murder plays heavily on her and her children and her attitude to the applicants and indeed this process, is, with respect, somewhat ambivalent.  It's a great mental shock for her.  \tShe is the head of the Parliamentary Committee in relation to Prisons and the Committee was invited to America to go in April of this year.  For reasons that she, or anyone else could not foresee, that meeting or that trip for the purposes of gaining information for the purposes of the legislature, was postponed in April to this time.  She is booked to leave this evening.  Her daughter is anxiously awaiting her arrival in the United States.  \n\tThe question may well be, well she doesn't have to be present, which is an attitude taken by the applicants.  It may be that if this was a claim for a paltry sum of money or some other civil case nobody could say that she is entitled as of right to a postponement, but where human emotions are involved, admittedly brought about by the two applicants, one would have expected a little more generosity in their so-called heads of argument, in relation to the position of Mrs Hani.  We will leave that aspect there Mr Chairperson.",

            "We are not unmindful of that letter Judge Wilson.  We have taken the matter up with her.  What we are asking you to do is that this is a very difficult part of Mrs Hani's life, she is torn with conflict and inner conflict and it may be that the letter is unfortunate but I would submit it should not weigh too heavily on the Committee as to whether or not a postponement should be granted.  If we were dealing only with her personal reasons it may well have been a different matter, but we submit that there are cogent reasons.  In fact you will see, Judge Wilson, that on top of page 2 Mrs Nicholls says that it was agreed, more than three months ago that this would be the date.\n\tBut if we go on with the further reasons Mr Chairperson.  We in fact, and I don't want to read the affidavit out, we in fact only got a substantial portion of the documentation two weeks ago, and we had to go to the Johannesburg International Airport in order to get it.  Whoever's fault it may have been that is a common cause fact.  \n\tAlso we note that these voluminous documents from Ada Parker and Mrs Lewis in Die Patriot were obviously burdensome to members of the Committee and the Committee asked by letter would they please indicate which portions of these documents are they relying on.  Apparently the Commission was favoured by highlighting a number of these documents.  We were not favoured by this.  \n\tIndeed in truth and in fact we have some 230 pages of -in the amnesty application, which we only got two weeks ago and which we could try and sift out during the long weekend, from the 14th to the 16th, those new documents.  \n\tThose new documents introduce a new ground, the one that I indicated as number four, that is that Mr Hani was a military target and this is why he was shot.  That inquiry will require viva voce evidence and documentation in order to show that there was no war on at that stage, he was not a military target.  We will have to produce documentation and evidence that he in fact had relinquished his role when he took over the position of general secretary of the South African Communist Party.\n\tThere is some argument about the number of pages that were actually served.  Matters are not decided by the number of pages, with respect, or the weight of paper, but rather by the contents.  If this case were to be decided on the basis of the applicants, that we only have to look at Ada Parker's letters and Die Patriot, then of course not much research would have been necessary.  But, as a result of their putting up a case that they acted on behalf of the Conservative Party, to collect some of the documents is not very difficult, but to interview persons who made public statements dissociating themselves from the applicants' acts, in the highest positions of the Conservative Party, is a matter which requires preparation and consideration.\n\tFurthermore, we submit that this is a matter, and I did make an offer to counsel for the applicants before we came here, I think it was Wednesday of last week, we should actually have a meeting, such as a pre-trial meeting, this not being a trial we could call it a pre-hearing meeting, in which irrelevant documents are removed from the files and let me say, that it isn't only the Ada Parker and Die Patriot, the applicants have sought to burden the Committee with literature relating to perceptions of Marxism and character assassination of the late Mr Hani, which we submit that on a proper appreciation of the main issues in this case do not have to burden the record that you have to consider.  We ourselves, mindful of what our submission is, will try and avoid personal references to the background ...(tape ends)  ....I have given notice of what the main issues are likely to be from our perspective of the case.\n\tHaving regard to what I have indicated we have already taken up the better, if not the whole part of today, to do this case on a piecemeal basis is going to be wasteful and we will not be able to do justice to the case.  Cases are best decided where there is a continuity in the proceedings, where we muster all the information that we have to put to the applicants right at the outset rather than later when it becomes available so that there are no adjournments and not recalling of witnesses.  \n\tTherefore I would submit that the proper course to adopt for the Committee at this stage is to grant a postponement to a date suitable to the Committee and because we, as counsel, have already been involved in the matter and the parties no doubt have spent some expense in order to retainers and preparatory work has been done, we ask that both sides should be considered as to when they are available and that the matter should be postponed, preferably to a period of more than five days.  It may be that there are other applications which can possibly be postponed to subsequent days on an ad hoc basis, not those of long duration, which may not make it necessary for the Committee to waste the days that may not be taken up.  But we submit that from our view of the case that at least 10 hearing days will be necessary for the proper adjudication of this case.\n\tThank you Mr Chairperson, Members of the Committee.",

I have partly prepared it and I could have done it on the 28th when term begins but Judge Nugent requires me in his court for three or four days on the 28th.

            "Mr Chair thank you.  I am not an advocate so my argument will probably be far simpler than Mr Bizos' argument.\n\tMuch emphasis has been placed on what the applicants' have failed to do, or what the applicants have erred in.  I want to state very simply, at least and at the very best for persons applying for a postponement the date of this hearing was known in February of this year.  The question arises, what would such a person do, a person who brings the application today to save their own situation with regard to the application.  During July of 1996 this application was handed in.  \n\tThe applications of the applicant consists of Addenda A, B and C.  As has been stated very thoroughly in the heads of argument Addenda A, B and C consist of the pages as you would have found them and as they are paginated in Volume B pages 1 through to 48.  You will note that there is an indication that this consists of pages 1 to 56, but that is in fact not correct, 48 to 56 is in fact not correct.  However, in paragraphs 12 to 18 of the heads of argument a complete explanation is given of the constitution of the various documents.  With respect, Honourable Chair, the only documents not in the possession of the legal team of Mrs Hani would have been the documents reflected as pages 57 through to 112.  The total of these documents consists of 66 pages.   \n\tI could you through these addenda and you would find that for instance in the works quoted, the History of Communism of Pike(?), 11 of these 14 pages consists of the front page of the book and the contents pages of this particular book.  All that has to be read out of the History of Communism in South Africa is a meagre three pages.\n\tIn the end what is at issue is not the volume of reading matter against which there is a complaint, what is involved is simply this - the person or institutions who oppose the application for amnesty know full well which requirements such an application must meet. There is a duty on such a person or institutions, when opposing an application, to prepare their case to such an extent that they would be able to bring contravening testimony at the hearing.  Allow me to restate this.  \n\tIf the claim in the application for amnesty would be A, and if these applications are then opposed, because the actual situation would have been situation B, any person or institutions who opposed the application must bring testimony to prove position B and to therefore contravene position A.  What does the persons do who oppose these applications they say, here is a series of documents, documents which you have attached to your applications, we must now work through these documents and once we have worked through these documents we will decide on what testimony we want to call and what will be necessary to contravene these arguments.  \n\tWhat must the applicants prove?  It's very simple.  When we look at the particular act it would appear that there must be full disclosure; it would appear that the person of the applicant must qualify in terms of Section 22;  and in conclusion it would appear that the act of the person in terms of Section 23 must meet certain requirements and qualifications.  \n\tWith respect, it is the most simple task for the legal team opposing us when they know what the claims are that are made by the applicants to contravene these claims by means of contravening evidence.  Mr Bizos says that there are four grounds or four points of difference which are at issue.  The first would be - ...full disclosure at the trial and in its applications.\n\tWith respect Chair, a person or an advocate in the person of Mr Bizos, a respected senior advocate, would in cross-examination be able to chase a person who has not made full disclosure from one side to the other of the matter.  He is well-known to be able to do this.  There is no reason to justify a postponement on these grounds.\n\tThe criminal hearing of the applicants was concluded four years ago.  Had the applicants not told the truth four years ago, and it's common knowledge that they did not give testimony, then there would have been adequate grounds and in fact reasons, enough time from then, or at least from the date when the team received notice that the applications would be considered, to collect testimony with which to counter the arguments. \n\tIt had in addition been argued that there would be an additional disagreement, namely, that the crime had not been committed on behalf of a political movement and would therefore not qualify in terms of Section 22.  Again, there is no need for documentation by the applicants to be provided to support their claim in order to enable Mr Bizos' team to contravene the claim.  They could independently go about gaining independent testimony to in fact argue against this claim.\n\tThe other two aspects with regard to disputes would, in a respect not be under disagreement and that could also be handled in terms of normal cross-examination.\n\tThe submission of the applicants Mr Chair is very simple.  There is something far more serious underlying the reasons for opposition to these particular applications.  It is important to pay attention to the fact that on the very first occasion, the very first reason which was presented when we were approached for a postponement the single reason given was that Mrs Hani, for personal reasons, would not be available to attend the hearing.  On the 13th of June 1997 a letter was directed to us in which it was stated that due to \"personal reasons\" she would not be able to attend the hearing and that there would therefore be a request for postponement.  \n\tOn the 13th of June 1997, 10 days ago, no single word had been mentioned yet that there would be a mass of work to conclude, that there would be a large number of reports that are awaited, that there are a number of witnesses that have to be consulted, this single reason was given, namely that Mrs Hani would not be available.  \n\tThe request was directed to enquire why she would not be available, the reasons were requested from the legal team and until today we have not yet heard what these reasons would be, except to determine that she was in fact on her way to America.\n\tIn the heads of argument we had to anticipate that this matter would be handled, and it is said that should she leave if I could handle only this aspect, should she be on her way overseas prior to or rather had she left with the date of this hearing already being agreed she would do it in the face of this Committee.   Had she made her travel arrangements overseas prior to the agreement of this date then certainly this date would not have been agreed between the parties.\n\tOn the 16th of June, on Monday, after the legal team of Mr Bizos had worked all weekend a host of new excuses appear.  The first of these would be that they received on the 8th of June, in their own words voluminous materials which had been added or supplemented by the applicants.  If the Committee would go back to the original applications submitted by the two applicants it is clear that when they submitted these applications the only page that was amended in the case of the first applicant, Mr Walus, was amended during January of this year. \n\tSecondly, that the second applicant, Mr Derby-Lewis amended his application during October last year by adding another page.  Addendum C, which the complaint apparently entails, comprised initially of three pages.  It was elaborated upon by the applicants and it eventually consisted of five pages.",

            "Thank you for the opportunity Chair.  The position, if I may resume my argument, is that once these amendments had been made, initially only to the statement of Mr Derby-Lewis during October of 1996 and then that of Mr Walus during January of 1997, on the request of Advocate Mpshe there had been additional information with regard to Addendum C.  You must take into account the original Addendum C, consisting of three pages, as mentioned in the heads of argument, that those three pages contained photocopies of all of the articles to which the reference is made, known as so-called \"Press clippings in periodicals\".  Copies of these were not attached, or rather what had not been attached was photocopies from the books mentioned in the index available to- Advocate Mpshe mentioned as items 4 5, 6 and 7.  For practical purposes no copies were made of these books.  A request then had been made by your Committee on the 12th of March 1997 that additional photocopies should be supplied, not only with regard to the books of which the copies were not made available originally, but also with regard to the so-called \"Press clippings in periodicals\".  This request was met in May of 1997 and these are the documents which arrived in the possession of the team of Mr Bizos on the 7th of June of 1997.\n\tThe point made by the applicants is that there is something far deeper behind this application for postponement, namely, that there still remains the notion that there had been a far broader conspiracy in which these two applicants were involved.  I will, in a moment, substantiate this.  \n\tSince the death of Mr Hani there had been consistent pressure and there were consistent claims that there had been a broader conspiracy this despite several occasions on which there were opportunities to investigate this.  Information with regard to the conspiracy has not in fact yet emerged.  \n\tThe submission of the applicants is that the opposition to their application has two parts.  Firstly that this Committee should never hear the application, and secondly, that should it be heard that the two applicants should not be granted amnesty.  \n\tOn page 40 of the heads of argument you will find an example of an instruction given by the lawyers acting on behalf of Mrs Hani, an instruction given to Spartan Tracers, an investigative firm, you will find this on page 14, it is Annexure JL15, and this is addressed by way of instructions to Spartan Tracers.  Mr Chairman it states,\n\"Re full financial disclosure.\n\t\tWe would be pleased if you would obtain full financial disclosure of the abovementioned persons.  We are particularly interested in the periods of 1992, 1993 and 1994.  Details of the past two years, though not important, would also be appreciated.  Particular emphasis should be placed on the period January to April 1993\".\nThis is the period of time during which the crime was committed, planning committed.  The names of the individuals and of Mrs Derby-Lewis and there are full reports from ITC etc.  \n\tThe conclusion could be drawn that there has throughout been an investigation continuing by the persons or institutions opposing this application to be able to trace the links of the applicants to third party activities, if you wish to call it so, or links to the previous government or whatever you want to refer to, to expose such links.  Until today these efforts have failed.\n\tIt is the submission of the applicants that these efforts will continue and that this is exactly the reason why the opposition attempts to postpone the hearing.  \n\tYou can hardly find a clearer example than in the final paragraph of the final letter directed on Thursday past, 19 June 1997, you will find this on page 37 of the heads of argument, Annexure JL13.  Here is a full elaboration by Mrs Nicholls of the circumstances bringing about the request for postponement.  That letter concludes with this very interesting paragraph, and I want to quote it for you.  The letter reads:\n\"In the circumstances, and in the view of the fact that we are awaiting reports on other investigations it is still our submission that we have had insufficient time to properly prepare\".\nIt is very clear from this that there is an expectation of other investigations by the instructing attorneys of Mrs Hani and/or the ANC and/or the SACP.\n\tIt is the submission of the applicants that until these organisations or institutions are satisfied that no link can possibly be proved or achieved between the applicants and such organisations that this Committee should not decide on this matter.  My submission is, with respect, that this is as clear as daylight.  \n\tI do not want to mention all the matters in the heads of argument with regard to public pressure, with regard to certain leaders in the political parties, who clearly and publicly have indicated that they would rather see the applicants in jail for the rest of their lives, and with respect, in contravention of the spirit and intention of the legislation.  \n\tI want to suggest Mr Chair that there are sufficient grounds to indicate that this is merely a tactic of delay on the part of the persons making the application for postponement and that this application should be denied.\n\tWith regard to the Communist Party, with respect, it would appear that they are also giving instructions for the opposition of this application.  The South African Communist Party knows from whenever of this application.  Why then were no preparations made, no preparations whatsoever to oppose these applications?  With respect this simply does not hold water.\n\tExcept if there are specific aspects which you would like me to address I will now conclude.",

I am perplexed how a copy of the letter came to be in their possession, a letter written to our agent to make enquiries about their accounts finds itself in their possession, but that's by the way.\n\tFinally I want to make this broad submission.  If this application for a postponement cannot be properly argued because of the state of the documents, can you imagine where we are going to go to if we have to struggle to find the relevant document whilst cross-examination is taking place?  I invited counsel for the other side to have a pre-hearing conference where we could possibly iron these out, my invitation was not accepted.  One hopes that if the matter is in fact postponed in the discretion of the Committee that we can do what is usually done in order that we should be on the same wavelength with members of the Committee when we are arguing the case.  \n\tEven on questions such as, whose case are we going to hear first, Mr Walus or Mr Derby-Lewis?  I would like to make submissions in relation to that having regard to their respective positions, but these are matters which shouldn't have to be argued, we should talk about it and come to an arrangement so that when we come here the documents are ready, witnesses are available, we can have the order in which witnesses are going to be called, we will want subpoenas to be issued on a number of people whom we will want to examine.
