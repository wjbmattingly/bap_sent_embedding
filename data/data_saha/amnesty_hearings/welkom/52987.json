The main object of it, and there's no suggestion whatsoever that there was any other object in mind of the three, four people involved in these applications, other than a political motive and the Volkstaat idea.\n\tThere is probably only one possible conflict and that's where Mr Kriel said - and I must say, Mr Chairman, I all of them were very very frank, you heard in the end Mr Kriel's frank admission that his parting of the ways with the AWB in 1993 was in fact a sham and that the three others were led up the garden path so to speak for other reasons.  He was forthcoming and very very honest and frank about it.  The only possible dispute between them as to whether injury and loss of life, where does that really fit in.\n\tNow you will recall that Mr Labuschagne initially said that they would try to avoid loss of life and injury and he listed the steps.  They held a prayer meeting and then they timed the attacks in the evening so that they would minimise the chance of this occurring.  Clearly he felt strongly about it.  In cross-examination it was stated simply as a fact to him that those were his instructions.  But it was clear from Mr Labuschagne's - if one looks at the whole tenor of his evidence, that he realised very well if you dabble with explosives only a fool will say or think that there isn't always a chance, a very real chance that people may get killed and injured.\n\tClearly, Mr Chairman, Members of the Committee, Mr Kriel doesn't or didn't feel so strongly about it, while the other two members, the two very junior members, those without rank, they obviously followed orders but they were under the impression that they would try to avoid death and injury.\n\tWe submit however, Mr Chairman, Members of the Committee, that that detailed difference should not be fatal for this application.

I would then just prior to adjourning, like to thank the community of Thabong and the relevant authority for providing this very nice facility to us for having these hearings, it's a very nice facility indeed.\n\tI would like to thank the Police Services for the security provided, although I must say that at no stage did we ever at all feel threatened in the slightest but the security was there in any event, thank you very much.\n\tI would like to thank the sound technicians for providing the sound, the TV camera.  It's been here every day.  The interpreters for their work.  It is an extremely tiring and difficult job doing simultaneous interpreting and the interpreters have done a tremendous job, thank you very much indeed. \n\tI'd also like to thank the caterers for spoiling us and giving us tasty food, tea time and lunchtime.  Mr Mapoma who has been involved not only at the hearing here but to a great extent before the hearings.  The Logistics Officer, Melaney, thank you very much indeed.  If I've left out any person's name - our secretary, Mrs Pollock, thank you very much.  If I've left out anybody's name I can assure you it hasn't been with malice or ill will.  I thank everybody for making these hearings run as smoothly as they did, thank you very much.\n\tWe will now adjourn, thank you.\nHEARING ADJOURNS",
