I stayed at a refugee camp called, Dukwe which was under the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.  That is where I joined the African National Congress.\n\tAfter staying there for some few weeks I left for Zimbabwe where I stayed in a suburb near Harare, called Hatfield.  During that time I became interested in politics.  Together with other comrades we proceeded to Zambia in Chelston. In Chelston its where we made a choice to undergo military training in Angola.  \n\tWe left for Angola together with more than nine comrades.  In Angola I trained Enikakulama(?) at a base called \"Richard's Bhani Molokwani\".  I stayed there until 1989.  As a result of Resolution 435 of the United Nations which compelled all the foreign forces to leave Angola, we left for Tanzania.\n\tSome of our cadres went to Uganda and some went to Tanzania.   From Tanzania at Eringa Place I again left to Tanga near the Indian Ocean where I further my military training.  \n\tI came back to Eringa where there was this influx of young comrades running away from political violence, that is black on black violence inside the country.  I was appointed a commander and a commissar at the same time to train those young comrades to come back inside the country to defend themselves and the people.\n\tI came to South Africa in 1992 on the 27th of February.  It must also be noted that during our stay in exile we used to discuss a lot about political violence taking place in the country, especially between the IFP and the ANC, and the young comrades whom we were training in Tanzania related to us the horrors of political violence inside the country.  \n\tWe sometimes listened to the radio stations like BBC, Duchavel, VOA and other stations relating the fierce violence taking place inside the country.  Then on the 27th of February I returned to the country as a former exile.\n\tI stayed in Thokoza, that is where the violence was taking its toll.  I found the situation unbearable.  People were dying there.  As a cadre of Umkhonto weSizwe I had to act my role ...\"\n...(intervention)",

            "Yes, Sir.  It was called black on black violence, normally by the media and other people who were not involved there in that violence but we knew that violence was not black on black violence, Sir.\n\"As a cadre of Umkhonto weSizwe I got in contact with some of the operatives inside the country and they advised me to go and help there at Polla Park,  to go and train the SDUs there. Polla Park was a very strong hold of the ANC.  Even militarily the place was feared by the previous rulers of this country.  We had all assortment of weapons including Vinanti airguns there.  The record states clearly that even the police, the Security Forces couldn't penetrate that place.  It was a base, a guerilla base.\n\tDuring that time violence continued because there are still hostels near Polla Park.  It was again exacerbated by the media that the ANC was fighting, I mean Xhosa speaking people were fighting Zulu speaking people.  We know by the time that it was not true.\n\tAfter getting in contact with some of the Self Defence Units there - by that time I was still staying in the township but sometimes I went to Polla Park because Polla Park is not more than five kilometres from where my brother resided in Thokoza.\n\tI missed being killed many a times.  Almost all my friends have been killed in Thokoza.  \n\tI was advised by the Self Defence Units of Polla Park to go and stay there in Polla Park.  I was given a shack to stay in.  We sometimes undertook missions to go and defend other places, for example Ermelo, Ratanda, Thembisa, Meadowlands and other places.  Some of my comrades, the SDU were arrested during those missions and some killed.\n\tOn the 1st of April 1992 I was approached by Sebenzile Ndabene(?) ...\"\nPardon Sir?",

I did so.  He said to me: \"We will be going to Natal to go and defend people there\".  It was a normal thing for people to come and ask assistance from Polla Park since a very strong hold of the ANC politically and militarily.\n\tAnother point to be noted Sir, is that in Polla Park there were political leadership and military leadership.  It's possible that those who are engaged in military actions may not know what's going on from the side of the political office of ANC at Polla Park.\n\tThen I cleaned the rifles.

Nxala is my co-accused, he is Johannes Scalo Nxala.  That's the reason why we had to pass at Bohlokong black township in Bethlehem.\n\tThe entire morning on the very same day I stayed in the house together with some of the people I mentioned here but it was Nxala and Sebenzile who went out with the car.  I do not know where they went to.\n\tOn the very same in the afternoon we proceeded to our destination, that's Natal.  We passed at a garage somewhere in the town in Bethlehem but I heard later that the reason why we had to pass at that town was for Nxala to collect money for Sebenzile.  Then we left for Natal.\n\tJust outside Bethlehem town the car stopped.  There seemed to have been an argument between Nxala and Sebenzile.  According to my knowledge, Nxala was not going to Natal.  The reason why he was in the car from the garage to the spot where the car stopped was to show Sebenzile the road to Natal, but I believe he will come and confirm that on his own, Sir.\n\tThere seemed to have been an argument between Sebenzile and Nxala and since Sebenzile was a trigger happy person I thought something was going to take place.  He was angry, this Sebenzile.  Then Wellington Fokazi said I must disembark at the back of the car.  It was a van, Sir.  I disembarked and together with Johannes Nxala, it was Johannes Nxala, Wellington Fokazi and myself then proceeded on foot to the direction of the township.\n\tI later learnt from Wellington that the reason why we disembarked from that car was that Sebenzile wanted to do something very horrible to Mr Nxala.\"\n...(intervention)",

My co-accused, Wellington Fokazi had a pistol too.  The man pointed us with his firearm and ordered us to climb at the back of the car.  It was an Isuzu car with an aerial and no canopy.  \n\tThe car then made a u-turn towards the direction of the tarred road to town.  Well in my mind there was one thing, the man did not tell us where he was taking us to.  The man pointed a firearm at us and the manner in which he was talking to us was not good, he was talking to us in a threatening way.\n\tThen we took a gravel road towards the tar road which leads to town, that's the Bethlehem town.  I said to my co-accused: \"Look here, before we come to that tarred road pull out your gun and shoot to scar this man.\"  My co-accused, that's Wellington Fakazi did the same.  He shot and scarred the man.  He did not aim at his body.

I do not know that man.  It later emerged that the man has since passed away, even though his death is still a question mark.\n\tTo further answer you, Sir, my co-accused who are based in Leeuwkop Prison, used to get visits from high ranking members of the ANC.  For example, comrade Ronnie Kasrils, Paul Machatile, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, Robert McBride,  ...(indistinct).  \n\tNow it seems as if something was discussed because this Thabo Motaung visited one of my co-accused in Kroonstad.  The reason why he visited my co-accused in Kroonstad was that he wanted to come and tell him that he lied in the Court.  There is even a letter which is in the possession of my co-accused Fusi Simon Mofokeng, where this man it's alleged that he was promised, I don't know 75.000,00.
