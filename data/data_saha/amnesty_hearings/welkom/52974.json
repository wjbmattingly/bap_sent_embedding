            "Yes, I can explain this way, in 1990 I was working at Glodan Engineering in Edenvale.  We were assembling taps.  I was receiving a salary.  Then there were riots between Inkatha and the ANC.  As I was working, but I couldn't go to work because of a problem with transport and I was also scared that I would be affected because of the violence at the time.\n\tOne day I went to the firm and when I arrived there the owner of the firm told me to choose between two things because people around the firm were looking for me, people that I was playing cards with during lunch, so he told me to choose between my job and my life.  I then stopped working because of that, I resigned.\n\tThen violence continued in Thokoza.  In 1990, before the end of 1990 the ANC took a decision that the community have to protect themselves, it then formed the Self Defence Units.  I was then one of the members of the Self Defence Units.  I was trained in Polla Park.  We were trained by the people who were able to use  guns.  \n\tThe police then came.  We thought that they were trying to bring peace.  After a while we realised that the police were also involved in this.  We reported this to our organisation the ANC, that there are people that are involved in this violence or maybe they are the perpetrators of this violence.  \n\tThen the ANC didn't trust that because we were the ones who were telling the ANC.  We wanted them to prove this so that when the police came we would then kill them and then show the ANC that here are these people that were involved.  \n\tAnd the Minister of Law and Order at that time said that that was not true because he was also the Minister of the Police.  He didn't want to admit that the police were involved but we tried to show them that the police were involved in the violence.\n\tOne day when this violence was still continuing the hippos came.  We thought that they were there to bring peace but we were doubting the white policemen.  And in that hippo with other, the police from elsewhere came to bring about peace in the area.  We realised that those police in the hippo, the people who got out of that hippo were Inkatha members and they attacked us.  A lot of people were injured in that incident.\n\tAgain on one day, to show you that the police were involved, a Blue Ribbon bakery car came and people went there to get bread for their Spaza shops and it happened during that time in that Blue Ribbon car, the Inkatha members were the people who got out of that car.  There were also Boers inside.  There were white people inside that car.  We then saw that this violence is continuing.  It was also reported in the televisions and we were then involved in this.  That is how I lost my job or I resigned.",

The call was from Natal and Sebenzile received this telephone call.  They wanted some help.  He was our section commander but there was a central commander, Nozulu.\n\tThey then told us that we were going to a certain place in Inanda in KwaZulu Natal.  We were eight and then we went there but one of us, Johannes Nxala was not a member of the Self Defence Units as we were members of the Self Defence Units. \n\tWe went through Bethlehem and he had a problem with Sebenzile, he owed him money of the Golden Product.  His brother-in-law promised him money.  We then went to Bethlehem to his brother-in-law.  Unfortunately we couldn't find him in his house, we found Simon Mofokeng in the house.\n\tHe then met with his brother-in-law, Johannes Nxala and he went to the garage.  He then got what he wanted from him.  After a while we continued with our journey.  They had a problem with each other, Sebenzile didn't want to listen to him but as I was close to him I tried to speak to him as he respected me.\n\tIf I'm not mistaken from Bethlehem to that particular area.  I think it is two or three kilometres away from Bethlehem to this area and then there was a T-junction to the left and there's a tar road in that area.  I was at the back, Nxala was in front and the driver.  Nxala and the driver were in the front and Sebenzile, the five of us were at the back.\n\tWhen we saw that there was conflict in the car I told Makhura about this conflict in the front seat, then the driver stopped the car, got out of the car, we accompanied Morena and we were going to go back to the car but because we couldn't walk for a long distance they followed us with the car.  \n\tWhen we were about three or four kilometres we heard a sound at the back, the AK47 sounds.  We then realised that something was happening behind us.  We then continued, we went forward.  I don't know whether you understand me.",

I was behind and I was passing urine and he pointed these people with a gun and he told them to get into a van, a white van.  I don't remember whether it was a Mazda or Izuzu.\n\tThey then got in the car, Nxala and Stephen Makhura.  He also told me to get into the car.  He was speaking Sotho and I didn't understand Sotho but it happened that I got in the car because I could see that he was pointing to this car.  We didn't know where he was taking us.  \n\tHe drove in a high speed and we were scared because we didn't know where he was taking us.  Makhura said to me, he told me to take out my firearm so that I could scare him.  I then did so.  To scare him I shot on top, one shot, the first shot.  He didn't want to drive forward and there were people in that car.  There were also rods there, I didn't know what he was going to do with them.  \n\tThose people then grabbed me.  They tried to take my firearm.  Tony then stood up.  They didn't know that Tony, (Stephen) had a firearm.  He then pointed them with the firearm and this white man stopped the car, they jumped out of the car and they ran.  \n\tThis white man continued driving.  I then shot for the second time.  He then stopped the car.  When he stopped the car he got out of the car and when he got out of the car he tried to come to our direction.  I thought that he was coming to me.  He then - when he stopped the car, Johannes jumped out of the car, he then met Tony and Tony realised that he was coming towards me.  I prepared myself for him because I could see that there was a fight.  Tony then shot him.  I didn't shoot at that time.  Tony shot twice.  We then ran away to the township.  That is all.",

And I was old to go for - I was not there - we were not there to rob, we had weapons so that we can fight.  So that is a lie what he said.\n\tHe went to Fusi Mofokeng in Kroonstad.  We received a letter stating that he visited Fuzi Mofokeng in Kroonstad in jail when we were arrested.  If I'm not mistaken I think it was in 1995 or 1996, if I'm not mistaken.  When Thabo went to Fuzi he said that he was asking for forgiveness because he was promised something.  \n\tHe told Fusi that he lied in Court and he was asking for forgiveness and he was going to try to help us to get out of jail and then Fusi asked him how he would do that.  He then said he made certain affidavits but I don't know to which office.  He went to the Magistrate in Kroonstad.  He made a confession statement about our case.  The Magistrate said that he should go to the members of the ANC, those that were said to have planned this affidavit.  The lawyer of the ANC had to make an affidavit and send that affidavit to him as a Magistrate and the Magistrate would sign and stamp it and send it to the Justice Department.\n\tSo Chairperson, what I'm trying to say is that I'm aware of this but it is not true, it is a lie and there is evidence about that.  And on the 25th of August George Ndlosi was working for the TRC in Johannesburg.  I told him about this.  I was together with Clement Ndabeni.  We told him about what happened before and we didn't know exactly what was the end of this.  George Ndlosi said they would follow this case because I said to my co-accused it is better to hide this boy because if the police were aware that he was giving out such an information they would take him out of the way.\n\tThen Fusi Mofokeng told me that he was out of the way.  So I didn't know about this robbery.  Thabo just told a lie about this but he didn't straight to me.  Thank you.",
