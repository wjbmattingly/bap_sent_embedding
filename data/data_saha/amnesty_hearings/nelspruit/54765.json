The reason I said so in court, even though I pleaded guilty, I realised that police were nailing me and they were making me a main culprit on this.  I said this in court because I did not want the police to have that impression about me that I left Witbank with Solly, because after the police arrested me they tortured me and I gave evidence that I was with Solly and others when we did this and it took police a long time to arrest the co-accused and that is when I realised that the police were basically against me and the second thing is that in court they had a separation of trial and awe co-accused were given a free bail and I was given a R5 000,00 bail and after that we were separated.

            "I could certainly do that or I could certainly do that, Mr Chair.  The essence of the evidence that is before this Commission is the following.  When the African National Congress was unbanned in 1990 and the United Democratic Front joined with the African National Congress in 1991 what had happened is that there were three layers of political allies.  There was the South African Communist Party, there was the African National Congress as a political organisation and there still existed MK.  Inside the African National Congress there were three parts.  There were members of the African National Congress who had been underground, there were members of the African National Congress who had returned as exiles and there were members of the African National Congress who had come through from the United Democratic Front.\n\tIt is also clear, certainly from the submissions of Mr Joe Nkuna, that the forces of South Africa who were looking after the security interests of the National Party Government at the time were aware of the overlays and overlapping of the liberation movements engaged in struggle against them.  The overlapping and overlay was exploited and mercilessly exploited by the mastinations of the security police and various other persons who set out deliberately to sew dissention amongst the ranks.  This was set out in the affidavit, at least in the submission which is now under oath, from paragraphs 43 and 44 and continuing through the document of Mr Joe Nkuna.  The effect was that South Africa, even after the unbanning of the African National Congress and its various allies, suffered a time of trauma where there was a lot of internecine fighting, a substantial amount of which had been instigated by the political forces in favour of the Government operating against the liberation movement at the time.  That is the general background and context in which all of these events must be viewed.\n\tOne of the simplest and most effective methods that was employed at the time, as set out in Nkuna's affidavit, is that a level of disinformation would be sewn between the parties.  The disinformation necessarily then amounts to the following.  A certain number of people would be impeached within the ranks of the ANC from different areas of the ANC itself and the South African Communist Party and members coming in from the United Democratic Front.  There is nothing at the moment to say that this method of operation was not employed also by the former State in this province Mpumulanga.  \n\tAs a result of this the security forces were able to exploit the divisions that necessarily existed by virtue of the overlay and the overlap between the organisations.  Once the divisions began to be exploited there occurred the attack which forms a background to this application.  An attack in October of 1991 upon Joe Nkuna himself.  This attack had some fascinatingly interesting features with regard to the actual motivation of the attack.  The first aspect was that it was certainly not a robbery.  The second aspect was that the briefcase containing documents was the only thing missing from the scene of the attack after Joe Nkuna had been attacked.\n\tNow, you will recall that in the cross-examination by Mr Patel a number of theories were put forward with varying degrees of forcefulness that the attack was precipitated by virtue of somebody being upset about Mr Joe Nkuna's infidelity with a member of the party.  There is no evidence to support that.  That the attack was done on the basis of some faction, there is still no evidence to support that.  Indeed, the evidence of Mr Nkuna is that he believes, and with justification, that some form of security force agency was responsible for his attack.  The significance of it being that his briefcase was stolen not his watch, not his money, not his clothes, not his shoes.  What is even more certain is that all of his Comrades in the area who were members of the African National Congress at the time were quite convinced that the attack had been politically motivated.\n\tThe reason for the motivation of the attack would have been, probably, that he was an MK commander himself.  It would also have been probable that he was, it was because he was a prominent member of the African National Congress.  What is interesting further about that attack is that it is clear that the police made absolutely no progress at the time in bringing to book his attackers and, therefore, I would submit that it would be proper for this Commission to find that the attack on Mr Joe Nkuna had been part of the general campaign that was occurring at the time of attacks on activists and that the likelihood and the probabilities of that attack having been organised or sponsored or, in fact, actually carried out by agents of the State is extremely high.\n\tWe then move to Joe Nkuna's version of exactly what happened during 1992.  He stated that after he had begun to convalesce during the early part of the year at a time that he actually cannot remember precisely, but reasonably early in the year, he had had contact with the leader of Umkhonto we Sizwe, Mr Chris Hani.  In that contact, of which there were several, he had received an order which related to a general order.  Now this general order was to eliminate state agents.  It has been put to him in cross-examination that it is very convenient that Chris Hani would have given that order since Chris Hani is not here to contradict him, but it is also common cause that all the parties recognised Joe Nkuna as a trustworthy commander and that is the evidence here.  There is no reason to believe that he did not receive that order and what is most significant is that there is no direct evidence contradicting his version.\n\tThere was ample opportunity by any of the parties interested to have brought evidence specifically to contradict that fact.  That has not been contradicted.  Indeed, the approach of the attorney for the, for Mr Skosana, has been not even to cross-examine on that aspect.  Now, in cross-examination by Advocate Black this Committee will recall that at a time in the later part of that cross-examination, Mr Nkuna got the time, date line of that year wrong.  If one has regard to the record, which is luckily typed, one will see that initially his time, date line was correct.  A few extra questions were posed by Mr Black after which Mr Nkuna started to get confused in his answers and the confusion was later then confirmed when he was posed a question by one of the Committee members, Advocate de Jager.  \tMy submission in that regard is the following.  That the original answer which he gave is the following and this is the one that should be accepted and is correct.\n\"The general order to eliminate agents of the State masquerading inside the organisations occurred early in the year probably February or early March in the meetings he had with Mr Hani, but that was a general order.  Thereafter a specific order was given where the name of one agent was produced and that agent was alleged to be Mr Shabangu\".\nNow, I am leaving my address relating to Mr Shabangu last, because I have some very important aspects to put before the court about Mr Shabangu.  The most important one will be that it is quite clear that the information that he was an agent was and is always false.  It was never true.  It was a feature of the disinformation that was going around at the time, but the time, date line of 1992 I would submit should be found to be the following.  First came the general order then came the specific order.  It is also significant, because this Commission necessarily has to look at the applications of all three applicants when deciding these applications, because they relate similar facts and the same incident.  That twice in the submission of Mr Skosana he mentions the general order and then only the third time does he mention the list of the persons who should be eliminated. \tNow where the two versions overlap is that both versions have general order first, specific person second and where both versions can be clarified is that under Joe Nkuna the general order was early 92 and the specific one late 92 and in Skosana's version the general order and the specific order are both late 92.  What that means is that both parties are, in fact, correct, but that Skosana has not accurately placed the timing of the general order, but Skosana is correct about the timing of the specific order.  The timing of the specific order is October, the timing of the general order is February or March and that would make sense and that is why the attack was carried out, but it does not mean that the information upon which that order was based was ever correct and I will deal with that presently.\n\tThe effect of accepting Joe's version, that is Joe Nkuna, will be the following.  If this Committee accepts that the evidence given by Joe Nkuna is correct this Committee, I submit, will have no option to do anything other than immediately grant amnesty to Skosana and immediately grant amnesty to Conrad Nkuna.  The reason why amnesty will have to be granted to both of them is because they were clearly soldiers under the command of Joe Nkuna and the essence of their applications, I would say, is quite straight forward.  Both of them bona fide carried out orders and the question of whether or not their versions are exactly the same can also be explained when I deal with the question of the commonality of versions. \n\tThis commonality of versions, I would submit, is the most significant aspect of these applications.  It is quite clear that Mr Skosana met first with Solly Morape and then together they went to Joe.  Solly Morape, according to Joe's version, was a member of the intelligence.  According to Joe Solly and Derick, as he calls them, brought the specific order.  Objectively, he said that specific order arrived in October and objectively we know that they did arrive in October.  Joe Nkuna has made a mistake.  He has assumed that because the two arrived together they both brought the order, but my submission is that this Committee should find that, in fact, Solly alone could quite easily have been the bearer of the name on that order.  If that is so then there is no conflict of versions between the two in any event.  \n\tNow, why is it then that Mr Skosana's version differs in some slight aspects to the actual attack, because the attack is common cause, it was carried out.",

            "Now, the question of the three names is the part that would relate necessarily to the submissions I am going to make about Mr Skosana's evidence.  Mr Skosana was arrested and admitted quite frankly, and I submit, totally honestly that he was assaulted by the police.  Now, Skosana is a member of MK.  The people in MK were not softies.  MK was a very, very difficult soldiering work to do.  The fact that a MK soldier very soon changes his plea to guilty and then comes to give evidence against his former commander must be explained in the context of the admission made by Mr Skosana that he was assaulted by the police.  When it was put to him, did the police add those names to your list.  Well, he denied that, but he would deny that necessarily to remain as consistent as he can.  He would deny that to remain as consistent as he can with the evidence which he had given in his trial and in the trial of the Nkunas'.\n\tWhat is significant about Mr Skosana is that he has a number of competing versions where, I would submit, had it not been for the assault of the police which he has agreed occurred with him, would have been incomprehensible.  Why would he have one version for his mitigation, another version for the Nkuna trial and a third version here if his plea had been fully voluntary and if his evidence giving in the trial against the Nkunas' had been fully voluntary.  Those documents which are before the Commission tend to suggest that his plea was done voluntarily.  Those documents before the Commission tend to suggest that he was the chief witness before the, against the Nkunas' and that he was doing that voluntarily.  Well, if he was doing it voluntarily then, why the difference between what he said then and now and I submit that this Commission is singularly in a position to be able to take that into account.  Those names, I submit, this Commission can find were submitted by the police and they were put to Skosana and that was part of the evidence which he gave and ultimately it has become something which he now believes, but when one goes to the effect of the actual substance and probabilities on that evidence, the most significant question relating to that point arrived from the Committee this morning in relation to the attacks against the three people that were to be taken, that were to be performed on the night of November.\n\tThree people were to be attacked, but there were only two grenades.  There was no transport, two people were to be attacked, but there was still only two grenades.  It is inconceivable that at any stage the three people on that list is the truth.  There was only one.  In cross-examination yesterday Mr Skosana said that the documents had been stamped by the police.  These were the documents shown by Joe Nkuna.  The probabilities of Joe Nkuna having documents stamped by the police that contained a list of people that he should execute on behalf of MK are so staggering that it is laughable.  In that regard I would submit that the evidence is tainted, but it is not tainted because Skosana is a bad person. It is tainted, because Skosana has shown that he is singularly human, that eventually the police broke him down and that must necessarily be the way to deal with this.\n\tNow, I am not saying this simply out of, out of the blue.  In Skosana's application there is a document produced which I have read which is in Afrikaans which relates to correctional supervision and the fact that they are going to give the man parole after two-thirds of his sentence and a further document which was handed to us in a memorandum which is written in Afrikaans and I quote from this memorandum,\n\"The memorandum of background information with regard to Derick Skosana as well as completed SAP 62\".",

            "Sorry.  The significant part here is that paragraph three reads as follows,\n\"whether or not he possessed leadership skills and whether or not he could be regarded as a leader.  He possesses no leadership qualities.  He can easily be influenced by leaders and is very submissive\".\nNow, what that means is this.  The man is a good soldier, but some people are born to be soldiers and some to be leaders.  Skosana is a good soldier, but he is not a leader, but what they are also admitting is that put him under a position of authority, for example, under the thumb of the police after arrest.  He has got no power to withstand their influence and I would submit that this is a pretty accurate document stating that the man is dedicated, but he can be influenced.  The word they used is \"beinvloed\" and the tragedy for Skosana is that he can be influenced both ways.  That is why he had to take the order, that is why he must get amnesty, but it is also why he came to give evidence which conflicted three times.  In his own mitigation slightly different to what he said in the Nkuna trial and quite considerably different from what he said here.  Does that mean that the man has not made a full disclosure.  Well, I am not going to argue his case on that, but suffice it to say that a full disclosure operates in terms of the Act under the rubric of a full disclosure of all the relevant facts and in my submission Skosana clearly falls well within that definition and I will be dealing with that aspect with regard to the Nkunas presently.\n\tThe question of no opposition is also significant here for the Commission.  We know that the attorney of Skosana did not cross-examine the Nkunas.  We are also aware that this is not a Court of Law, but the Commission will take it into account that the attorney who was present throughout or his employee had access to the statements made by the Nkuna brothers from the first Monday, a good three days before I personally became involved in this matter.

            "Mr Chair and members of the Committee, then I am going to move to the argument concerning the full disclosure of the relevant facts.  I would submit that the proper way of interpreting that aspect is that the full disclosure of all relevant facts relates to the question of what is relevant.  A full disclosure of what is relevant is not the same as a full disclosure and the reason is that lawyers have long known that there is a difference between evidence which is admissible by virtue of relevance and evidence which becomes inadmissible by virtue of irrelevance or hearsay.  Now, if one takes that as the bench mark of what needs to be stated, the relevant facts here relate to the question of what actually took place and I would submit that their are four key relevant facts.\n\tThe first one is the fact of the order and that is divided into two parts.  The general order and the specific order relating to Shabangu.  The second one relates to the fact of the chain of command.  The third one relates to the fact of the attack and the fourth one relates to the fact of their motives, because that necessarily then brings into play Section 20, sub-section 3 of the Act where they justify.  Now, for example, where the Commission is faced now with a conflict of versions relating to the individual facts, because one party says two people threw grenades and another party says one person threw a grenade, is that a relevant factual dispute and my submission is clearly it is not, because both are common cause in the following aspect.

In that regard I would submit that the evidence that was found proved in the Magistrate's Court of the fact that one of the grenades exploded inside the bedroom and one of the grenades exploded outside of the house is clearly consistent with the version that was bought before this Committee by the Nkunas.  What is also, I would submit, very important in this regard is to accept that their is an inherent improbability that Joe Nkuna himself would have been part of the mission and the inherent probability relates to a structural aspect of MK, the fact that commanders generally did not go on raids.  They were the ones who organised them in the background and then the physical probability that as a result of his injury he would not be participant to a raid by virtue of the fact that he would not be able to get away particularly because we know that that raid was carried out on foot and that there was no vehicle to assist them in the getaway.  The probabilities that he himself were present are staggeringly low and I would submit that his evidence that he was not present and that he had organised it is what should be accepted by this Committee.\n\tNow, when it comes to the disclosure relating to how he got the orders, again I would submit that there is nothing to gainsay that he had the order as a general order from Mr Hani and then as a specific which he thought had been carried through from military intelligence by two people, but in fact it could well have been only one and that is Solly himself.  The problem that both Skosana and the Nkunas' have is that both Solly Morape and Mr Chris Hani are dead, but the fact that they are dead, does that mean that we have to reject their application for amnesty because there is nothing to corroborate it when indeed if one looks at the whole sequence of events everything else is corroborated and what is even more important is that there is no hard evidence before this Commission to set up anything in substance that goes against Joe Nkuna's version.  There is no hard evidence.  There has been more than ample opportunity for any of the victims to come in.  There has been more than ample opportunity for any of the parties to lead conflicting evidence, but there is not the type of evidence which says we know as a fact that Joe Nkuna could not have got the order from Chris Hani, because Chris Hani, for example, was out of the country at the time.",

First he pleads not guilty then guilty.  Then his guilty plea in mitigation is not quite the same as his evidence in his, in the trial, it is not quite the same as his evidence before this Committee.  He is not reliable where he denies that.  Joe Nkuna is quite clear about it.  What is significant as well about Skosana's evidence, not only does he meet Solly, but he has also met other Comrades and on two occasions he mentions the other Comrades, but you do not really know who they are.\n\tNow, even if, and one is trying to argue a reconciliation of the versions so that in fact all applicants versions can be accepted if one looks at what could possibly have happened.  Nkuna is absolutely sure he got the order from two people, but it is possible, it is possible that in fact when he says he got the order from two people he is wrong, because he is making an assumption.  He gets the order from Solly, but because the two have arrived together and the order is not contradicted by Derick Skosana he in his mind accepts it is an order from both.  Therefore the versions are, in fact, seemingly to compete, but capable of reconciliation, but what there is nothing to gainsay is the fact that Solly, according to Nkuna, was definitely a member of military intelligence and there is something to gainsay that Skosana is, because he denied it himself, but that is not Nkuna's version and there is a conflict which will have to be resolved as the Committee sees fit.",

Firstly, Mr Shabangu did not agree with that approach when asked specifically about that by the Magistrate and what that says about Shabangu is the following and I would ask this Committee to make this as a finding.  It means that Shabangu is a man of the most exceptional integrity.  It means that Shabangu is a very balanced, evenhanded and fair man.  Where does one find a victim who has nearly been killed by his attacker saying I am not going to speculate that that was the reason.  Shabangu is clearly a man who is so fundamentally honest that he is not even prepared to stoop to the level of imputing a motive be it false or true, but the fact that he did not shows that because Shabangu himself is a man of integrity and balance and honesty is that he did not believe that that was the reason and that is the significant aspect.  He did not believe that is had anything to do with that.\n\tHe, Shabangu, was also aware, he must have been aware of the problems that had been going on at the time with the disinformation and Shabangu has been in the hearings and was a victim and has not come forward to discredit Joe Nkuna and what is even more significant, Shabangu and Nkuna were friends.  He knew, he knew the man and he knows that Nkuna would not be motivated by the pettiness of trying to get back at an individual where a collective decision had been made to suspend him and where he had survived the suspension and, in fact, there is no direct evidence that at the time of the attack there was any correlation between his suspension from the African National Congress and his position as a MK commander and that, I submit, is the most significant aspect there.  As a MK commander he stands apart from the political organisation.  \n\tSo, Shabangu knew that.  Shabangu knows that he is not prepared to come and add grease to the mill.  He is not prepared to make a statement that because of a problem in the political arena Nkuna took it out in the military arena, no.

Well, we leave that one at that point and the other one would be, you see if Mr Nkuna, Joe Nkuna did go to, well you have dealt with it anyway to some extent.  Our concern was just that if he did in fact go to the scene he would have withheld relevant information and that would amount to non-disclosure on a material and relevant thing, aspect and why must we disbelieve Mr Skosana when he says that Joe was there.  I mean he has been consistent, well, maybe he misplaced the, him with regard to distances and the like.",

That he just was not in a position to be able to run away and the object was that they would run away.  Now, you will recall that the members of the Committee, Advocate de Jager also asked a number of telling questions in that regard.  I thought that would have clarified the issue forever.  He is clearly wrong about that.  He is clearly wrong.",

One was the question of the origin of instructions.  We have less problems with Conrad and Derick Skosana on that, because both of them got instructions from Joe and that is not in dispute.  That point, that difficulty is only in relation to Joe, the origin of the instructions.  As I said that would require of you to read this, the record and then the second thing was, well, his presence, alleged presence at the scene, you will deal with that.

The fact that Mr Shabangu made revelations and the like.  You have dealt with that, but those are the things which really worry us around Mr Joe Nkuna's affidavit, but do deal with other points in your argument.
