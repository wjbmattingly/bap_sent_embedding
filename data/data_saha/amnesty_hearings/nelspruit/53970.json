            "Having considered the reasons advanced by Mr Morgan for applying for a postponement in respect of Mr Rakgotho's application, the Panel hereby grants such a postponement.  It does so, notwithstanding the objections raised by Mr Mokoena on behalf of the victims.\n\tWe as a Committee are enjoined by the Act to be particularly compassionate to the victims.  I just want to highlight here now that the Committee has always been compassionate to victims and the fact that we are granting Mr Morgan's application does not mean we are being insensitive and lacking of the necessary compassion we are supposed to have as a Committee to victims.\n\tIt is a fundamental right of all applicants to be properly legally represented in a hearing of this nature.  The reasons advanced by Mr Morgan for not being able to proceed with the legal representation on behalf of Mr Rakgotho, are good reason advanced.  We don't think Mr Morgan would be in a position to properly represent Mr Rakgotho if this application was allowed to proceed, in view of the complete lack of consultation as explained by him.  \n\tWe must, however, again register our extreme displeasure at the manner in which the TRC and that is the administration of the TRC, continues to instruct attorneys to represent the interest of the applicants.  It is an untenable situation that any legal representative can be instructed at a 24 hour notice as it has happened in this case and be expected to properly represent the interest of an applicant.  \n\tWe hope this untenable situation will not occur in the near future, particularly as we approach the new millennium because it is instances such as these that perpetuate the snowballing of this process.  \n\tWe also with Ms Mtanga, that next time a hearing of this nature is set down, we do indeed appear to be sensitive and compassionate to victims by ensuring that a venue which is appropriately located, within the victims locality, is chosen.  This venue is completely inappropriate.  To have victims having to travel over seven hours to attend a hearing, I think it's completely insensitive and we hope such issues will be taken into account by the administration, before deciding on a venue.  This hearing is therefore postponed sine die.\nCOMMITTEE ADJOURNS",
