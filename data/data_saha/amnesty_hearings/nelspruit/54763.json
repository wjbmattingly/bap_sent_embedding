            "\"All these charges relate to an attack on the house of Mr Johannes Shabangu, that took place on the 10th of November, 1992 and in which I was involved.\n\t\tI am the younger brother Joseph Harold Nkuna, whose testimony this Committee has heard, and who is some ten years older than me.  My family circumstances are as those set out in his statement to the Committee.  At the time I committed these offences in respect of which I seek amnesty, I was 17 years old and a student at the Tembekha High School in Ganyamizani.\n\t\tAs a teenager, I idolized my brother who was a role model to me and my family.  I became involved in the politics of liberation in 1988 when I was in standard 6 and living in Swalalha.\n\t\tI was an active participant in youth and civil structures in my home area.  I was strongly influenced by the cadres of Umkonto We Sizwe, whom my brother brought to my sister's home, where I lived.  These MK cadres whom I regarded as heroes, showed me how to use light weapons and taught me much about their struggle.\n\t\tIn 1991 I moved to Gwayamazan to live with my brother.  I was in standard 9 at that time and at his house too, I met many MK cadres whom he was assisting.  I got involved in providing support to MK cadres by transporting them to and from safe houses.\n\t\tHelping them fetch and hide weapons (indistinct) boxes and generally provide them with the support they needed.   Although I knew how to use weapons, I was never a formally trained soldier.  I was however a member of the ANC Youth League.\n\t\tThe attack on my brother was traumatic both for myself and my family, particularly as we had lost a sister some six months earlier, who had died at a mysterious fire at her home at Giyani.  At the time of my sister's death, we suspected foul play.  She was the pillar of our family and did a great deal to support us.\n\t\tWe suspected that the police were involved in an arson attack upon her and that it was done to hurt Joe and his family.  I believe as did my family and those comrades with whom the matter was discussed, that attack on Joe was orchestrated by members of the Security Forces who had recruited members of the ANC for this purpose.\n\t\tMy brother was a great leader of the ANC, a stalwart of the struggle and somebody whose death would be a huge blow to the movement in this area.  There was little doubt in my mind that the agent responsible for the murderous attack on him, will try again and that if they succeeded, that will be disaster, not only for myself and my family, but also for the movement as a whole.\n\t\tWhen Soli Morapi and Derick Skosana arrived at my brother's home with information regarding the identity of the agent, who had ordered the attack on my brother, I was quite willing to participate in their plan to kill this person.\n\t\tI went willingly with the two MK cadres to carry out the attack.  My role was however, not as an attacker, but fundamentally as a guide to point out to the two cadres the house and the room in which Mr Shabangu slept.\n\t\tDuring the attack however, I was armed with an AK47 rifle which (indistinct).  It was given to me by Soli and I returned it to him immediately after the attack.  Only two grenades were thrown during the attack and no shots were fired.\n\t\tOne of the grenades went into the room, the other exploded outside.  I truly believed that Mr Shabangu was the only occupant of the room and I was not aware that Mrs Nolene Lingwale was present.  I certainly had no intention to harm or injure any other occupant of the house.  I do appreciate however, with hindsight the possibility that they may have been injured or killeD.\n\t\tAfter the attack, we fled on foot to a safe house near (indistinct) and a day later, left for Swalalha.  Soli left a briefcase in my room containing a handgrenade and 20 rounds of ammunition.  The briefcase was mine.  When he left it, I believed he left it there by mistake.  We were arrested at the house in Swalalha a short while later.\n\t\tThe raid came as a complete surprise to us and no resistance was put up.  Soli was shot dead by Major Van Zyl, notwithstanding the fact that he was armed.  His personal firearm was under the mattress at that time.\n\t\tI have little doubt that he was killed deliberately.  I participated in the attack in the absolute confidence and belief that I was doing the right thing.  I was accompanied by two experienced soldiers and the attack was planned with their council and that of my brother who was a senior MK Commander.\n\t\tAt no time did I doubt that it was a legitimate attack on an enemy agent and I had a bona fide believe that it was a furtherance of the struggle in which the ANC was engaged.\n\t\tThere can be no doubt in the fact that the victim of our attack was believed to me to have orchestrated the attack on my brother, made me susceptible to participate.  I will not however, acted as I did if I had not  believed that the attack on my brother was a political motivated attack and an attack on the ANC as a whole.\n\t\tEmotions such as revenge, malice and spite are not known in my family.  The values that we were taught as children are those of caring and tolerance.  I did not act out of a test for revenge.  I associated myself with the statement of my brother and in particular his express desire to be forgiven and to effect reconciliation.\n\t\tIn all the circumstances, I pray that this Honourable Committee grants me amnesty\".  \nI thank you.",

            "Thank you Mr Chairman.  I made enquiries, it related to the position of Chris Hani.  My enquiries, during the year of 1992, enquiries reveal that in 1991 Chris Hani, the late Chris Hani was elected to become the Secretary General of the South African Communist Party as a consequence of that, he did not participate in the Command structure of MK, he was the Chief of Staff up until he became Secretary General.\n\tI am given to understand that he did in fact continue as Chief during the transition period, Chief of Staff before handing over to Mr Sipiwe Nyanda, who became Chief of Staff of MK.  Mr Joe Modise was always a Commander of MK.  So all I can in fairness to the applicant put, that there is a serious doubt that at the time in 1992, Chris Hani would have been actively participating in the Command structure of MK.  Thank you, that is all.",
