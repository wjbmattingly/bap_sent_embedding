Would you please place those earphones on your ears because what I am saying now will be interpreted.\n\tAre there any people here related or connected to victims?  Would you also collect ...  Thank you.  \t\n\tThis is a matter in which the three applicants have attended this hearing in order to apply for amnesty in respect of a number of offences.  The offences for which they make such applications involve, as a result, various victims and in making such application and explaining themselves, have implicated other people in the commission of such crimes, or indirectly connected.  The hearing is governed by Act 34 of 1995 being the Truth and Reconciliation Act as amended.  In terms of this Act, people who have committed crimes with a political motive and who are prepared to make full disclosure, are entitled to be granted amnesty, but the Act goes further.  It provides and compels the administration of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in the form of the Amnesty Committee, to give proper notice to victims and/or their families as well as implicated people, that such a hearing is scheduled to take place on a particular date, at a particular venue, such that their interests, whatever that may be, can be protected and if they so wish, to oppose the applications.  Those are undeniable rights that emanate from the Act.  \n\tFor quite a while now, various Committees of the Amnesty Committee have been complaining that such notices have not been properly served, if at all, resulting in matters having to be postponed or adjourned and generally resulting in time-wasting and a waste of tax funds.  \n\tIn examining the documents related to this application, this Panel has discovered that there are a number of people who are implicated and have not at all been informed of this hearing.  There are one or two victims or families of deceased victims who also did not, or at least we can't say whether they were properly informed.  In my view it is an utter disgrace.  \n\tWe know of the hardships that applicants and victims and implicated people have to go through in order to avail themselves of such hearings.  Apart from the anxiety, they go through great financial expense because not all expences are covered by the TRC and the time has come, I feel, for the administration of the TRC to take note and take notice of what we have to say and really come to the assistance of all those who have a legal right in the results and actually the hearing of each application.  \n\tBefore I make a ruling on what's going to happen henceforth, are there any questions from any of the applicants?  If you want to say something, or ask something, now is the time.",

I'm sure you will agree it's very unacceptable, untenable and I undertake to raise these objections with the Chairman of the Amnesty Committee as soon as I can.  \n\tUnfortunately we cannot proceed with the hearing today because of those problems that I have mentioned and in the circumstances, we've got no option but to postpone the matter and I will see to it that instructions are given to those who are charged with giving out notice, that such notices are properly given out and served on the proper people timeously.\n\tI thank you.
