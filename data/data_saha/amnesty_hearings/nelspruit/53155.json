            "Thank you Madam Chair, I will try and be as brief as possible.  Madam Chair, it is true that the applicant, Mr Mtambo's application, the Committee heard today from the outset, it appeared that there might be, it is true that he did submit several applications, and there is also reference to an application for indemnity as well as a sworn affidavit, in fact two of them, which supported his application.\n\tMadam Chair, I think briefly, by starting if one looks at the requirements of the Act, and if I may just start with the political objective of the act which has to be established, Madam Chair, it is my humble submission and it is some extent also corroborated, although there was certain statements by the defence witness, Mr Phumayo, who opposed the application, Madam Chair, I think it is as the testimony of the applicant said, there was according to him, the time immediately preceding the death of the deceased, Mr Phumayo, there was an intense conflict in kwaDela, between the opposing political parties, the ANC and the IFP.\n\tMadam Chair, I think it has been clearly established that Mr Mtambo was a member of the IFP by his own admission, he was a Youth League leader and the issue which was just now clarified, towards the end of proceedings, what exactly status the deceased had, Madam Chair, it is true that the applicant indicated that he cannot deny that there was indeed another Youth League Chairman, but he was under the subjective impression that the deceased was indeed the leader of the opposition party, the ANC.",

            "This is true Madam Chair, there is certainly some of the aspects that might raise eyebrows.  This is however the testimony of the applicant.  Madam Chair, if I might just further continue, in view of the fact that he was told by the deceased himself, according to the applicant, that he was the leader of the ANC as well as in his evidence, he made mention of threats and he was also made aware of these particular threats by Duduza, that he was under the impression that his life was in danger.\n\tHe realised that something had to be done.  Madam Chair, it is to be expected and it was a question that was also raised by the Committee that if this were committed within party political context, why were some of the senior members, or specifically with reference to Mr Nkonza who was a leader of the local IFP branch, then not informed of his intention to perpetrate this act?  Madam Chair, the answer in all fairness was a very strange one, in that he said he might not have been, it might not have been approved, which certainly makes it a bit more difficult to believe or see this in the political context which he alleged it happened.",

I think it was not satisfactorily answered.\n\tMadam Chair, I think it all boils down to the question, was there a sufficient political motive for this crime, and again, I think it should also be seen in the context of the applicant as a witness, whether he was a credible witness and his version should be believed.",

It is true that he in his evidence given today, differs substantially from that in his applications, Madam Chair, it is true that he said that the offence was committed in self defence, which was also his line of defence during the criminal trial.  Madam Chair, in my opinion, maybe the applicant should be afforded the  benefit of the doubt in the circumstances.\n\tSaying, by his own admission, that he wants amnesty and that he is prepared to tell the truth, therefore.\n\tMadam Chair, one can however not get passed some of the very substantial questions surrounding key issues which have not been answered satisfactorily.\n\tI think there is just one which I think one cannot over look this, even though it might be very detrimental, when asked by Madam Chair, in his application it is stated that the deed was committed with a political objective of furthering the causes of the IFP, and in cross-examination he said that he did not want the community to find out about this killing, because it would damage the image of the party in the township, Madam Chair.  I think that speaks for itself, it is a contradiction which he was unable to clear up.\n\tMadam Chair, all taken into consideration, I think  ...",

There is no evidence to suggest that there was any hidden motive.  Madam Chair, the flipside of the coin is that is not enough, the question to be answered is was the political motive strong enough and I think that might be the problem.  Even in the absence of anything to the contrary, the evidence of the applicant himself might not have been enough to convince the Committee.\n\tMadam Chair, just in conclusion, I think should the Committee find him to be a credible witness, maybe thought could be given to amnesty, but I would leave the decision in the capable hands of the Committee.",

            "My submission today in this matter is that the applicant has been unable to make full disclosure and I would agree with my learned friend, that the political objective is not clear at all, or the political motive.\n\tI base this firstly on the fact that on the question of why he actually committed the offence, there are quite a number of reasons that are given, contrasting reasons, really.  When you look at page 3 of the bundle, he talks about the fact that there were elections, so he wanted to eliminate members of the opposing party.\n\tHe also gives the same reason in his application for indemnity.  On page 10 he talks about the fact that the deceased had to be eliminated because he was a stumbling block towards achieving their political gains.  At page 11 he speaks about the fact that he was eliminated because there were several attempts to kill him.\n\tAt page 28, he says because the deceased attempted to shoot him, it is quite a number of reasons, but it is true that it is not clear really what the motive is.\n\tWhich leads me to speculate, I don't know whether I am allowed to speculate, but from the instructions that I got, it appears that the applicant feared the deceased, hence he didn't even have the, he wasn't brave enough to face him, hence he shot him at the back.\n\tI don't want to elaborate on that very much.  The applicant also admitted having been scared or fearful of the deceased, himself, which maybe might explain why he shot him in the back.  I don't know, but I also leave it to the hands of the Committee to make a decision.  Thank you.",
