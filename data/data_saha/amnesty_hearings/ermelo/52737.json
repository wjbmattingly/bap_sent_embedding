When he went out, I asked Pat as to who these guys are and he said I should be very careful of them, because they were National Party people.\n\tAt about seven or eight o'clock in the evening, I heard a knock at the door and when I opened the door, they showed themselves at the door.  I thought that probably they had come to either kill me or attack me and when they left, I had taken my gun earlier on and when I opened the door, they made gestures as if they were taking their guns from their holsters or from their waists.  That is when I started shooting.\n\tErnest died on the spot, but the other one did not die on the spot.  When we searched them, we got some pangas from their bodies and I indicated that we should put them back into the car in which they arrived and we drove the car.\n\tBecause I did not know the area, and there was a river somewhere, somehow, I was not able to go through or go passed it, we took the documents which were inside the car and we burnt the car.
