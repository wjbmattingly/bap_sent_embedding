The problem I do have at this stage and I am not stuck with that decision, I must add, is that it is precedent to which I am not bound, it indicates that you can't get blanket amnesty, but only in respect of specific events, crimes committed.\n\tHence I ask the question because I see in your schedule, I think it is on page 20, the proposed witness applies for complicity to commit acts of violence against third force elements in general.\n\tThis does give me problems because at the end of the time, if we are inclined to grant amnesty, then - or refuse amnesty, then we must to it in respect of particular acts, particular crimes.  In other words there is no such thing as granting amnesty for crimes you may have committed.  The order can't read that way.",

That is a mere suggestion unless you feel confident of handling it now.",

I don't think it is going to have any effect time wise on their preparation, because I am sure they prepared in whatever way necessary on the events that he made mention, unless you are going to get a new event out of him, I am not too sure.\n\tIn that case, then he can stand down and you can proceed with the next witness.",
