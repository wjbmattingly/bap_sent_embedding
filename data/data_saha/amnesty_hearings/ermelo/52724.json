I thought this would go much quicker, but in order to put the Committee or inform the Committee as to the general events and circumstances which also prevailed at Piet Retief and in respect of Mr Gushu's application in particular relating to that area, I propose calling a witness, the current incumbent Mayor of Piet Retief, Mr Andries Gamede who will be able to advise the Committee as to what circumstances prevailed at the time Mr Gushu was recruited.

I would want to indicate that there were already a few incidents that have taken place in Piet Retief.  In 1982 Vusimuzi Mbongwa who was from the local township was a member of the MK.  He was actually killed by a farmer in an area which is about forty (40) kilometres away from Piet Retief, after a bombing of a petrol station.

In 1986 a member of the underground of the ANC, a local person, Philamyeni, was actually killed under mysterious circumstances which up to date we don't know exactly what happened.  During the year of 1987 to 1988 we had a situation where a car full of, a small car, a Toyota Corolla, of members of the ANC were ambushed by the police from Piet Retief.  And in 1988 we had a situation where a kombi full of members of the ANC were killed, all of them in that kombi.  What actually shocked the community in Piet Retief worse was that there was an inquest that actually took place in Piet Retief where Advocate Moranyani, who is now involved with the Commission of Inquiry in the Shobashobane massacre, one lady was actually shot through her vagina in that incident.  Some of the people, the bodies, were stripped with bullets and the car that they were in was stripped with bullets.  Obviously in 1990 we had a situation where ... (intervention)",

            "Okay.  In 1990 out of the unbanning of the democratic forces, I think in my perception as a person who was in Piet Retief at that time, I think the security forces, if you look in terms of the 80s, they were more involved with operations that were actually directed to members of the ANC.  Obviously the community was quite surprised in Piet Retief, you couldn't have a meeting.  There were a thousand procedures.\n\tActually 1989 we had the so-called election of the local council and us as democratic forces, I was already there in Piet Retief, we actually opposed the elections of the council.  It was a policy that as master democratic movement we actually opposed the question of the re-election of councillors.  But, however, people stood which meant that whoever was part of those elections was actually supporting the policies of the former Government which we didn't recognise, the Nationalist Party.  Under these circumstances, I think the person who got the highest vote in those elections, because we actually had campaigned in the community to oppose those elections, I think it was Mr Msibi.  I think he got about six hundred (600) votes and the others got about fifty two (52) and some of them were just elected unopposed, because nobody actually opposed them.  So, we had a council now which was formally established which was actually representing the Nationalist Party from 1989.  Then Mayor Mr Vilikazi became the Mayor and we actually campaigned as the community to say that they must resign as councillors because we believed that the system that they were representing was not representing the people of South Africa.  \n\tThen the perception from the community was that these people must resign and it seemed that in 1990 when the unbanning came, the security forces had a change of strategy because now they were forced to have an ANC which was inside the country which was legal.  Now, they had to deal with an ANC which was in Piet Retief which they were not sure who is MK, who is what.  As we understand, that there was then an internal decision that was taken because it was seen that Mr Vilikazi was not actually enforcing the police of the Nationalist Party in order to ensure that his oppressors, he was given a free trip to Germany.  \n\tWhen he returned from that trip he was overthrown by Mr Msibi who then became the Mayor.  When he came back from that trip he was already removed as the Mayor of Piet Retief.  I mean it's a township because that time you had four councils.  So, it was the way of the township.  Then Msibi took over in around 1990 and that's where we actually experienced a lot of difficulties as communities. We couldn't hold meetings because we were not allowed to have meetings, to call meetings, we had to use churches because you will be told that the council must sit before you can get a hall and they are not sure when the council is going to sit.  \n\tThen in 1990, I think it was around March, the community obviously, because they were demanding that the councillors must resign, water was cut in the township.  And that's when things went worse in 1990, when the water was cut.  Then there was an attempt at that time to kidnap  myself and Councillor Thabede.  I wouldn't say, there were a lot of people who were injured, some were shot with rubber bullets who are still carrying those rubber bullets because of that situation, you know.  When they tried to kidnap us, unfortunately there were people around.  We then approached Baklender who is now the Director-General of Land Affairs.  He actually issued, I think that's what actually saved our lives, he issued a letter to Piet Retief to the commander in chief of the security branch which were actually mostly involved with the covert operations.  I think that's what actually tried to save our life at that time, but as I have mentioned, that I wouldn't count who was hurt and what-what.  Some students were shot in schools.  \n\tThe situation was just chaotic, and we then received information at that time that there was a small gang calling themselves PAC.  I think there was an attempt to create a gangster which, when we discussed with our own colleagues in Ermelo, it seems as if the same thing was happening where they will come up with a small gangster and that gangster was actually trying to destabilise the community.  In one of the community meetings, I think it was 1991, there was an announcement that was made by the Mayor Mr Msibi that he needed people who are looking for jobs, and those people were actually bused to Gauteng.  In Gauteng, as we believe, because most of them came back because they were just ... (indistinct), but they told me that they were looking for work.  They were actually going there to be trained.

But I'm just narrating the situation of how I understand the situation in Piet Retief at that time.  Then we then, I think it was 1991, if I'm not mistaken, we then heard that Mr Msibi was shot.  Obviously we didn't know exactly what happened.  I think the whole community was shocked to hear that Mr Msibi was shot, but after he was shot I think in early 1990, just after he was shot, Mr Eric Nkosi was arrested for allegedly shooting Mr Msibi for business matters.",

And please, if the Commissioners can bear with me, because I'm talking from the perspective of the community and I want to present the perception the community are having, because I believe at the end of the day I would want to summarise this thing because we think as a community of Piet Retief.

In 1993, when the students were actually having a memorial service for Sithule Hleza, it was just a year after he was killed, three students were executed in a military style.  They said they saw something that went up, then they were shot and killed, three of them when they were coming from the burial site in Piet Retief.  Just after three days from that a member, a chairperson of the Civic Association, Mandla Magudulela and Mphelele Malinga were killed.

I went undercover in Pongola and I pretended as if I was coming from Mr Sydney Mufamadi's office and at that time when I actually arrested Mdu close to about two hundred (200) soldiers in that court in Pongola because he went to Pongola because one of the members, as we know now, of the hit squad who were operating in Piet Retief, shot an ANC member in Pongola.  So, he went to court in Pongola to see his friend who was arrested in Pongola.  Now, the allegation that these people - maybe let me finish the incident.  I will go to the allegations and I will say why I'm saying it's allegations.  When Mandla Magudulela and Mphelele Malinga were killed by Mdu Msibi, again it was just chaos.  Politically we tried having meetings with the police, with everybody to say but can't anything be done, people are being killed and I must be honest with you, nothing was done.  Then we came to a stage where we called the President of the ANC to come to Piet Retief, Dr Nelson Mandela.  I think he came just a day before, it was on the fourth (4th) of September.  The day before he came another member of the community, Jusiah Thabede was shot through the window of his house, and as we understand, they were saying they wanted Mr Mandela to walk on top of his blood of his people.  Luckily Mr Thabede was not killed.  He sustained serious injuries.  He went to stay in a hospital in Johannesburg for about three weeks.  Now, this is Piet Retief.  Late in 1984 we then politically tried to manoeuvre, to find out because we knew that some people knew about what was going on and we actually, one lady who was deployed who fell in love with one of the killers, that when we first ...

I think for their benefit I believe very strongly that they can take lawyers.  The system that was there defended them, the courts, the police and everything, they were not prosecuted you know, because of the system that existed, but I think for the interest of the community it will be important that one day maybe in their hearts they must decide which I'm prepared as a leader of the community now that maybe we go back to the community and say, \"Sorry, it was part of the conflict.  We had hoped that maybe the Nationalist Party was going to continue to be in power and it didn't happen\".
