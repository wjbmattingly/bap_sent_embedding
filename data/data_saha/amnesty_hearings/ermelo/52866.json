Mr Mbambo, together with the other applicants in this matter, the other number of applicants in this matter, have all given evidence previous to today.  This hearing has commenced some time ago, I think it was in March of this year when we sat in Durban and we heard about incidents that occurred in the Durban area.  And then from Durban we moved up and we sat for a couple of weeks in Richards Bay where we heard further evidence as to occurrences which occurred in that region.  And then last month we moved down to the Hammarsdale area where we had another hearing, where we heard about incidents that occurred there.  And then of this whole application, this is the last leg of it, as it were, where not all the applicants are involved, but only two of them.  Mr Mbambo and Mr Hlongwane will be testifying as to incidents which occurred in this area, as well as the one incident which occurred in the Bushbuck Ridge area.

He was involved in hit squads in most of these areas, and there was an investigation on him and he was supposed to be arrested by the South African Police.  They have already requested that the KwaZulu Police should suspend him so that he could be investigated.  He was called to come to Ulundi by Ntwana Chief Gatsha Buthelezi who was the Minister of the KwaZulu Police at the time.  He wanted to discuss about the suspension.  Siphiwe requested me to accompany him to Ulundi.  We went together to Ulundi.  When we arrived at the Legislature in the KwaZulu Government that's where we met Dr M G Buthelezi.  After the discussions Siphiwe told me that they had discussion about his suspension and the Chief Minister agreed that Siphiwe should not be suspended from the KwaZulu Police.  However, the Chief Minister, referred to as Ntwana of Phindangene requested that Siphiwe shall come to work at Ulundi.  However, since Siphiwe was a person who lived in the cities, he didn't like going to go and work at Ulundi.  He put conditions that he can only come to work at Ulundi if he could be put in charge of any particular unit there.  All the units which were existing at Ulundi had their own commanders.  Therefore there wasn't any unit in which he could be assign.  Therefore they have to establish a new unit and they called it the Firearm Unit and they made him the commander.

One day he came to my house where I was staying and we had some discussions, and we also discussed politics.  And he also introduced himself to me as to who he was, and also his involvement in the IFP as an organisation.  He also asked me if I know about the Israelites.  I said, \"Yes, I know about the Israelites, even if I don't have more information about them\".  The Israelites were known as a gang, the two hundred (200) Gang which was recruited by the IFP to be trained in Israel, to come back and fight against the ANC within the country in South Africa.  The reason why they were called the Israelites, it was because they never knew where they were taken to.  They thought they were taken to Israel, by they were taken to Caprivi where they were trained.  They were known by all the KwaZulu Police members and that also they were trained to fight against the ANC.  He introduced himself to me as one of those people, and he also told me that there is a difficult situation in the place, in that the IFP people are being killed within the community by the ANC members.  He also said that he has recognised me with Siphiwe Mvuyane, the person I've just explained now.  He trusts me and he believes that I'm also a member of the IFP, and anything that he's going to say to me will be kept secret, and we agreed on that.  And he said that he was sent to recruit me to join the Caprivi group so that we can fight and attack the ANC.  I said to him, \"I understand what you're saying, but I can't just easily join your group without having had any contact with the people who sent you to recruit me to be sure that I won't find myself in trouble as times goes on\".  And then he took me at that time to one lady, a mother known as Mrs Mbuyase.  This Mrs Mbuyase was a member of the Central Committee of the IFP.  This Central Committee acted as an Executive Committee of the IFP at the time and she was also a leader of the Women's Brigade for the IFP.  I was introduced to this mother by Gin Mkhize and I introduced myself to her and she also introduced herself as Mrs Mbuyase to me, and she told me that I should relax because Gin Mkhize are their members and they were sent by her and the other members from Ulundi, and therefore she is happy to see someone committed like me to come and help and join them to fight against the ANC.  She said I mustn't worry because she's going to arrange a meeting with the senior leaders of the IFP at Ulundi so that we can discuss the matter.  We agreed on that, on that particular day.",

            "We left her place.  We went to my house and we came straight to Nelspruit, Mpumalanga.  It was becoming late when we arrived.  We stopped at a police station, in front of the police station in Khangwane.  We waited there for some time.  It was becoming dark and a Mercedes-Benz car came.  It looks like it was white.  A male came out of the Mercedes-Benz and talked to Siphiwe Mvuyane, and he went back into his car and we followed this car.  We proceeded until we arrived at Bushbuck Ridge.  There is a shopping complex in that town and when we arrive at the area, we stopped in a parking just outside the entrance of the shopping complex.  Siphiwe instructed us to come out and to go to the person who we met at the Khangwane Police, driving a white Mercedes-Benz.  Siphiwe talked to this man.  He came back to us and got into the car.  We waited a moment and then a young man came and talked to the person who was in the white Mercedes-Benz.  The person in the white Mercedes-Benz came to tell us that Mr Theledi is not there, he's in Pretoria, and it looked like he will not be back to Bushbuck Ridge for some few days.  We have to drive back to KwaZulu-Natal.  I reported to Mrs Mbuyase because Siphiwe Mvuyane have to proceed to Durban and if we were to go back to Bushbuck Ridge he was supposed to come and accompany us.  After some weeks Siphiwe came back and we drove back to Bushbuck Ridge.  We were three.  It was myself, Siphiwe Mvuyane and Israel Hlongwane.  We went to the Khangwane Police and we met the very same white Mercedes-Benz, and it's occupant talked to Siphiwe.  Siphiwe came back to us.  It was on this particular second day when Siphiwe introduced us to this man who was driving the white Mercedes-Benz.  His name was Willie Moekwena.  He was introduced as an IFP coordinator at Ulundi and also in Mpumalanga.  We were introduced to him. We got into the car and we proceeded towards Bushbuck Ridge and it was drizzling on that particular night.  We went there and stop just at the entrance of the shopping complex that I've already mentioned.  On that particular day Mr Theledi was pointed to us.  He was inside the shop, and we were standing outside.  As we were waiting there were so many police in the area, surrounding area.  I think they were the Lebowa Police, because their cars had LP registration numbers.  We waited until they left and the shops were close.  Japhi came out with the other people he was with.  They got into a red car which look like a Honda.  They left.  On that particular day we left about the operation, we didn't proceed.  Siphiwe talked to this Willie Moekwena who was driving the white Mercedes-Benz, and we drove back to KwaZulu-Natal, and we went back to report to Mrs Mbuyase, and Siphiwe went back to Durban.  It went on like that.  Siphiwe Mvuyane was killed at the University of Durban-Westville in Durban.  Wiseman Nconco came to me at Esikhawini.  He was driving a sky blue VW kombi, a Caravelle.  I used to know it as Siphiwe Mvuyane's car.  He delivered - he told me that the IFP in Mpumalanga and Nelspruit, they are still complaining that the person who is troubling them, who is supplying firearms coming from Mozambique to Ermelo is still alive and nothing has been done about him.  We went together with this man and explained this to Mrs Mbuyase.  Mrs Mbuyase instructed that we should come back to Nelspruit and therefore we had to proceed to Nelspruit.  We went to Nelspruit.  It was on Friday evening when we left Empangeni, and we arrived here in the early hours of the morning.  We went to a township known as KaNyamazane in Nelspruit.  We stayed in one house there and during the day, on Saturday, Willie Moekwena, who was said to be a coordinator, came with driving a kombi which looks the same as the one we were driving in.  It didn't have registration numbers written.  We have already removed the number plates in our cars.  It was no longer the NT, it has the computer numbers, registration numbers.  The other one had also computerised numbers.  And we get into the cars and we proceeded following each other, going towards the Bushbuck Ridge direction and we were put into his own hotel.  We stayed there.  And someone by the name of David came.  It looks like it was a brother to Willie Moekwena.  He was sent to go and do a reconnaissance as to whether Mr Theledi is there.  We waited the whole Saturday, and we were told that he went to Johannesburg or Pretoria, and on Sunday evening we decided to go back to Durban because we couldn't find him and we will come at another date.  We agreed.  Willie Moekwena said we must go to Nelspruit in town to buy food.  We got into a car, his car, Willie Moekwena's car which is a Caravelle.  I've already explained, as looking the same as the one we were driving, and therefore we drove to Nelspruit.  As we were driving on our way we met a Honda Prelude which was red.  Willie said, \"This is the person\", and he referred to him as Mr Theledi.  We proceeded forward and did a U-turn and went back to stand at his place.  We waited until it was late and when it was becoming dark, because when we left KwaZulu-Natal to Nelspruit we were armed with our issued firearms as KwaZulu Police.  We were not holding AK47, Makarovs, all those unlawful firearms because we're afraid of meeting a roadblock on the way, and we knew that we'll get firearms in Nelspruit.  Mr Moekwena took out an AK47 which we were supposed to use.  When I took the AK47 I find that it was muddy, full of mud.  It looks like it's been used before, and I realised I can't use such a firearm because it's not safe, because it has been used before.  The AK47 I'm talking about was brought by David who was a brother to Willie Moekwena.  I told them I don't trust this AK47.  They say to me they don't have other firearms.  We said we'll use our own issued firearms and we'll report when we go back and there might be tampered with when we go back to KwaZulu-Natal to hide the evidence.  Mr Willie Moekwena explained to us that - he asked us actually as to whether we still remember how Japhi looks like and he ask us to describe him to him.  And I told him he has short hair, he doesn't have long hair.  He has cut his hair and he's growing grey.  His hair is growing grey and he's also clad in a lot of jewellery.  He's also armed with a gun which he normally puts on his leg and he also had a bodyguard who is armed with a shotgun.  And we proceeded to this place.  It was myself and Wiseman Nconco.  Wiseman was wearing a bulletproof vest inside and a jean and also a black hat.  I was also wearing a jean and a T-shirt which was black and also a cap which was black.  We went there.  We found him and we agreed that when we arrive there we are not going to speak Zulu, we are going to speak English because when wearing these hats, they wouldn't be able to distinguish whether we are whites or coloureds.  We entered and we found him in the supermarket next to a tiller.  We greeted him in English.  He responded back.  We proceeded along the shelves in the shop.  We turned around the shelf and come back.  We were on the other side of the shelf.  When we're coming back I told Wiseman to go and stand at the entrance, to wait for me because I was supposed to shoot him.  As I was turning around the shelf proceeding towards him, I already pull out my firearm.  I was holding a Z88 9mm.  I shot him with this firearm.  It was about some few shots and he fell to the ground.  After he fell to the ground I shot him on his head.  After he collapsed I saw his firearm on his leg.  I just went out of the door and turned towards the back of the building.  It looks like the police barracks.  I went through and jump a fence and I was coming out of the Mkowena Complex.  We left our car about a distance from the scene. We entered into a white 4X4 car.  I'm sorry, I don't remember whether it was Willie Moekwena who was driving or David himself.  We left the scene and they dropped us next to our car.  It was already dark because it was at night.  We get into our cars and we drove back to KwaZulu-Natal.  We arrive late at night at home.  The first thing we did was going to Mrs Mbuyase to give the report.  She was so happy and she said she'll call Ulundi to report this report and thereafter we went back to our police station.  We phoned the Mkowena family to find out as to whether he died or not and they confirmed that he died and we went back to Mrs Mbuyase to report that it's true, he is dead and she was so happy saying that she's going to give the report to Ulundi.  And that's how Japhi Theledi died.",

Mr Chairman, if my learned friend is saying he's seeking for a postponement because of the additional documents that were given to him today, that consists of two pages.  If that is the reason for seeking for a postponement then I must hasten to oppose such an application.  Mr Chairman, and members of the Committee, the applicant was represented in July in the same application by the same advocate who knew the matter very well and when the matter was postponed by the then Committee, it was indicated to my learned friend the advocate here present that certain things are to be put right.  It was some time in July.  Now, I cannot understand, Mr Chairman, I'm not saying he should be able to do the matter today, but the bulk of the matter is known by my learned friend.  He prepared the documents.  He represented him in the month of July and he has consulted with the client many a times before this very month in July.  Now, for him to need a postponement only to read two pages, that are nothing new but it's just an amendment to the original affidavit, I've gone through that affidavit.  It does not change the original in any material respect.  He's just amending and saying, \"I'm putting right what I've said in the other affidavit\".  Mr Chairman, I must put on record my utmost dissatisfaction.  I know it is the duty of the Committee to do that, but the way in which my learned friend has carried himself in this matter is really, if I'm not blamed for being defamatory, very unethical.  To keep the Committee waiting for the whole day and the people and everybody here only to seek at the last moment a postponement.  Mr Chairman, when we left the chambers, the idea was for them to look into the question of calling witnesses, whether they will call them or not to discuss with the client.  They did that and they came back to me and I said, \"Look, if you've got that witness to call, Mr Sibiya, I have no objection.  You can hand up his affidavit and dispense with him.  I will not object.  I won't even ask a question pertaining to Mr Sibiya's affidavit\".  My learned friend and his attorney agreed and they said they are going to talk to the client, and when they come back now it is no more the question of witnesses, it is a question of further information.  Mr Chairman, I'm dissatisfied by this changing or moving around of poles at the expense of the taxpayer's money.  That is all.",

            "If I may reply.  If we talk about changing of poles. My time schedule, initially this matter was - there's the Caprivi Strip matter hearing.  This, I was giving to understand, would be a matter which was going to be slotted in on Thursday.  I then had to reschedule my time to Wednesday and I've made an attempt to be here today.  As I say, the delay I must apologise and I don't want to be - I'm certainly not going to be naming people and colleagues.  The difficulty that I've found myself in is that there is a witness.  I certainly haven't consulted with him.  It's quite correct what Mr Mpshe says, I have consulted with Mr Sambo, the applicant.  The reason why the matter was postponed on the last occasion was simply again that there was no time to hear his application.  As originally scheduled, I'm available tomorrow, I'm available on Thursday and it's simply that, after having discussions with the applicant this morning, and as I've indicated, together with the additional possible witness and his wife, it would, in my respectful submission, not be doing the applicant any justice if we simply proceed with the evidence-in-chief and end up with a part-heard matter or something to that effect.  We all know as lawyers, part-heard matters cause great difficulty in the sense that we've got to get all the parties together again.  I must apologise again for the delay, but I can give the Committee the absolute assurance that it's through no fault of mine and I've attempted to get here.  But as I say, as scheduled, I'm available that Mr Sambo's matter be heard either tomorrow or Thursday, but I also appreciate the fact that there are other matters that have been apparently scheduled now for Wednesday and Thursday.  I have no idea why I'm supposed to have been here today.  I've been attempting to get some explanation as to why at the last minute I had to be here.  So, I would again just apply for a postponement on behalf of Mr Sambo, and it's not just the question of the two page affidavit.  There is a necessity to have a consultation with him.

            "Yes.  This matter, as mentioned earlier, was postponed yesterday until 9:30 this morning.  It's now 2:30 and I must say that we as a panel were upset and very much dissatisfied by the fact that not only us, but all the people present in the hall here, the other legal representatives were kept waiting in the dark as it were until just before lunch time.  It seems from what Mr Black has told us, that there was some misunderstanding that this matter would be proceeded with on Wednesday, and where that comes from I don't know, and I'm sure Mr Mpshe doesn't know either, and that misunderstanding or the coming about of that misunderstanding is also most unfortunate.  \n\tMr Black has, on behalf of the applicant, applied for a postponement in this matter stating that he would require a further consultation with his client, notwithstanding the fact that he has in the past had consultations with the client.  \n\tThere's also the possibility that a witness or witnesses may be called despite Mr Mpshe's offer that any affidavit would be submitted by such witness on an unopposed basis.  However, our main concern is to ensure that the applicant gets a fair hearing in this matter, and I'm sure if it started today, having a look at the papers before us, and having read the affidavit of the applicant, that the chances would be very great that we wouldn't even conclude the evidence-in-chief of the applicant which would mean a part-heard matter in the middle of the applicant's evidence which is not very desirable.  It's most unfortunate the whole situation surrounding this whole application, particularly today, but we are of the view that after having heard Mr Black's problems relating to the matter, that it would probably be in the interests of the applicant to have the matter not heard today.  We are aware at the same time that this loss of a day constitutes not only a great waste of time, everybody's time that's been here, but also a loss of resources as well.  And although we are loath not to proceed with the matter today, we think that it would probably be in the interests of justice that the matter not be heard today.  I think in the circumstances then, the course to follow would be at this stage just to remove it from the roll and it can be set down at some later stage.  Unfortunately then we will not be proceeding with the matter on the application of the applicant, and we will then stand adjourned until half past nine tomorrow with regard to the other amnesty application, namely the application of the so-called Caprivians.  That application will no doubt take up the whole of today and go into Thursday and might even take up most of Thursday.  \n\tI, in the circumstances, do not think there would be any purpose in postponing this particular application to either tomorrow or Thursday, because that would more than likely result in people coming again only to be disappointed again.  \n\tSo, therefore in the circumstances, the application of Voice Morris Sambo is removed from the roll and for it to be set down at some later stage, and we will then adjourn until tomorrow at half past nine where I'm informed the matter will be proceeding.  The other matter, the other application will be proceeding.  We will therefore adjourn now.\nPROCEEDINGS ADJOURNED TO 16 SEPTEMBER 1998\nON RESUMPTION ON 16 SEPTEMBER 1998",

I took the report as it is to Noah and reported it as I have stated, and Noah instructed me to search, hunt and kill Bhobholina.  I hunted him day and night.  I couldn't find him.  I took a report to Noah.  Noah was very frustrated and he said he better call Daluxolo at Ulundi because seeing as though I don't know my work, and why can't I shoot Bhobholina's mother if I'm able to find the mother, because if I shoot the mother Bhobholina will come back for the funeral.  Therefore we can shoot him at the funeral.  I would say it was myself, China, Makunga.  Makunga is a surname, another man who was working at the Ermelo Mine, Mtunzi, Obed, Jomo and another one which I remembered later it's Bafana Khumalo.  We went to the house. When we arrived at the place I positioned them, some at the windows, some by the door.  Jomo was holding a litre which was half filled with petrol with a string which therefore it was a petrol bomb.  There was a bigger house which was Bhobholina's mother's house.  That's the house where I went to investigate to look for him.  I couldn't find him and China was armed with an M26 handgrenade.  I got into the house alone.  The others were surrounding the house so that if Bhobholina come out through the windows they could kill him.  I searched the whole house.  I didn't find him.  I went back to the kitchen to see if he's not there.  I asked the mother and therefore that we shall go to the kitchen to see if Bhobholina is not there, and at the kitchen I shot her on her chest and that's how she was killed.  And before we left the place I instructed China to remove the pin of the handgrenade and throw it into the house and thereafter I went back to Noah and gave him the report.  He was so happy about the report and he said we must wait for the night vigil.  Unfortunately since Sabata was dead, there were so many police around because Sabata was a Black Cat member.  Therefore there were so many police on that particular day, we couldn't enter to the Bhobholina night vigil and we couldn't kill him.  That's where I end.",

When the community was fighting against Charles Maseko.  Charles Maseko was working in one of the offices here.  Unfortunately one million disappeared and he was suspected as a culprit.  So therefore since he was trained as a soldier, he has to leave his home and go and stay with Charles.  Now, I'm talking about the Maseko house.  I'm talking about the house of Charles Maseko.  On this particular night when Ms Nkosi was injured, it was myself, Charles Maseko, the owner of the house, Noah and China.  Noah, roundabout six (6) o'clock, said, \"Today we are going to kill Ms Nkosi\".  Charles Maseko said, \"If we can be able to kill this woman, she's a troublesome woman in Wesselton, and she's the one who decides women\", and we all laughed and we left to Wesselton, myself and China.  When we were at Wesselton on that particular night we meet her.  She was having a baby on her back.  China confirmed that it is her.  If I remember well, at that instant a car which was a bakkie carrying furniture, a furniture bakkie came and it stopped at her gate.  And then she bent.  I did the U-turn and went back to her.

She had the problem with Christina because it was said that comrade normally assembled at his place and we were told that we shall go and kill him because that's where the ANC is based.  Therefore I took China who pointed the house to me, in the house.  It was a big house, when you enter the home the gate is standing directly to the entrance to the garage.  China explained that it's a grown-up man who has hair.  We left Noah's place and we were going to do both the operations on the same night.  We left Isikhumplazi after shooting Ms Nkosi and that particular night we went to Estancia.  We didn't first get into the house, we went out to confirm if he's there and they found it and Christina confirmed that she was there, and therefore I entered into the shop and China went down to stand by the corner.  I entered wearing a jean.  My gun was inside the jean and I was wearing a T-shirt over which was COSATU T-shirt, red in colour.  And the gun was right in front.  This Crucket came and he went up.  When coming back he was towards my direction and I shot at him, and he started crawling or rolling.  I couldn't jump because there was a fence and there was only a small hole where you can take out goods or money.  So, I couldn't therefore shoot him while he was crawling under this counter.  There was shooting from the house because there was one young man who was a policeman by a Zulu surname.  I think it might be the person who was shooting, but I'm not sure.

I said to Noah, \"Since you are here, I'm under your hands, what do you say about this\".  He said, \"You shall go\".  And we said to him, \"I can't go during the day because my work is to kill people.  So if I go during the day the community will recognise me.  So I will not be able to go around freely in the community\".  Therefore I sent some Black Cats men first to the area.  They used Mr Mkhonza's car.  These young men, the Black Cats young men, went to the area.  On the same day, later, Malahlele came.  Malahlele is a member of the IFP in the town and he was travelling in a van or bakkie.  And there, after his arrival, I left to Mkhonza's place.  I arrive and slept over.  On the following day Mkhonza called the police station at Davel and another man by the name of Felani Mthethewa came in the company with a white person who was clad in a uniform.  They were driving an Ace AP van.  They all came in.  We greeted them by shaking hands.  I also greeted the white man.  Felani said to me, \"I'm happy about your arrival because what you did in Ermelo it's what we expect you to do here\", and I said to him, \"I can't talk to you because I don't even know you and I don't even know this white man\".  And he said, \"You don't have to worry about this white man because the white policemen in this area hates the ANC\", and he said to me that I'll travel together with this policeman.  I got into the police van and Felani will point out to me all the families which have to be attacked.  I entered together with the driver and Felani, we were three and we started driving slowly and Felani was pointing at all the houses.  In the morning I was with Mkhonza.  They pointed out one house at the corner which I discovered later to be belonging to Malinga, and we patrolled the area and when coming back we went via the Malinga house, and we just have talks with him, this Felani, and he left.

I will say after the attacks we'll run back to Mkhonza's place and even in this particular time we ran back to Mkhonza's place, and after that the police car, known as the Casper came.  It stopped at the gate and there was Felani.  He talked to Mkhonza and asked whether all the boys are all back.  Mkhonza asked me whether the boys are all back and I confirmed that they were all back.  And then there were policemen in the car, about nine (9) of them, they were all white and Felani was the only black official.  As the houses were burning and people crying we were in this Casper and we were travelling around.  The Casper didn't stop in any particular scene, it just passed around the area.  And we went to a place at the soccer field.  There was a lady who was crawling on her knees and she was crying, and they switched on the Casper's bright lights and when we look at the ground we saw a boy trying to jump a fence.  We ask what was happening to the child and \"what was happening to you\", and she said someone was trying to rape her.  \"As we were doing that, you came running trying to jump the fence or a concrete wall\".

            "Yes, I can see that, sir.  Before I explain here.  In Davel, after the burning of the house, I realised the need that - I realised it's not going to work because there are ANC members who like to avenge, so I have to get people posted in Davel since it was not necessary to have them in Ermelo.  So each and every house we posted young men and one day as I was coming to check my posted men.  I was with Jomo, Bongani Khaba and Sdiga.  I started from Mkhonza's place.  I found Bongani.  I ask the whereabout of Dumisani.  Bongani said, \"Dumisani have just left.  He is going to Felani's place\".  And I said, \"Okay, I'm going\".  And I passed to another place where there's a lady by the name of Gumbe.  I checked that place and thereafter I went to another man's place by the name of Mathibula, I don't remember if he was an Ikatha member.  I found some young men there.  I asked them how they progressed.  Unfortunately I had three (3) rounds in my firearm and I realised that things were still fine.  When coming back I met about fifty young men.  They asked me how does it come about that the ANC people are getting killed.  They stopped us in the middle of a road, they were holding stones and fork spade and spades.  They said during the times of the Black Cats, it was Sibusiso, I don't remember well, I think he ran away with my identity or my photo to join the ANC in Davel and they already know me and I could see that as they start ask questions to this man that there will be problems.  And I asked Sdiga and Jomo to keep quiet and I told them that it's better that I speak to these men to avoid any conflict.  The information they had was that there was a policeman from KwaZulu who is killing ANC members.  Things became tough.  I was armed with this 9mm which I got from Noah and there were many and they were having stones on their hands.  I pulled out my firearm.  This shining gun like the glass windows at the interpreters' booths and it is - I mean the frame, the steel frame.  They said it's a toy and they came towards me.  I shot one on the arm and I realised that I only had three (3) bullets, and when I shot Sdiga and Bongani realised there's going to be a fight and they ran away and I was left.  I gave them a distance to run away and they didn't enter Mkhonza's place, they passed the place and ran.  I shot one on the arm, they all scattered and I was left with two shots and I ran away.  They followed me.  I realised they were coming close to me.  I kneeled on the ground and I shot back.  They stop and I started running again.  And we ran until we entered a farm, a white man's farm.  When we arrived there Sdiga was stabbed by the comrades and he had been stitched on his stomach.  As we were running and then I shot the last one.  The police in Davel has already noticed this and they were running on the other side of the road trying to stop us at the front.  I said to them stomach down.  They lay on the ground on their stomachs and then we hid in the grass.  They came to the grass because they saw us and then they found us.  They took us.  They didn't arrest us or handcuff us.  They took us and Felani asked me, \"What are you exactly doing.  You could have been shot because we didn't know it was you\".  But they said, \"No, you don't have to worry because nothing will happen\".  At the time we were at the police station ... (intervention)",
