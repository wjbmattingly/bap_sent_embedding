It's a document that's 21 pages - that's in Volume 2.  I just want to explain that this document was in fact the heads of argument submitted by Mr Sogget in that Commission and did not form any part of Mr Goldstone's report.  The reply which I drafted and replied to this and which was fully considered by Mr Justice Goldstone is not annexed so I would ask that it merely be ignored as it's merely submissions made by another counsel.

Perhaps, perhaps and I'm not inviting to go further than next week on Friday but perhaps we should start thinking of dates also for further hearings.  The quicker the better because the rolls, the new rolls have not been scheduled yet and if we indicate to Cape Town Head Office that this panel is required in Ermelo on a particular week then it's easy for them to slot it in on the new roll, okay?  Then we'll adjourn till 1 o'clock on Monday.\nCOMMITTEE ADJOURNS",
