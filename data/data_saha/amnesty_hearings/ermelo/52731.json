            "As it pleases you Mr Chairman.  The next applicant is Mr Mkhwanazi.\n\tBefore calling him to the stand, we wish to make an application in terms of Section 33(1)(b), namely that his evidence be heard in camera.  The reason for making the application is as follows:  Mr Chairman, you and your learned Committee Members are aware of the hostilities that are existing between the various parties that are present.  It has been reported to me through the applicants that I represent, that they've received death threats more particularly aimed at the four people who formed the Special Committee.  \n\tThe three applicants, save Mr Mkhwanazi, are resident in Ermelo and are well-known to everybody, hence a similar application will not be brought in respect of them.  Mr Mkhwanazi however to a large extent and because of the manner in which he conducted himself in the Ermelo area is unknown to a lot of people, in fact his role in what took place is to a large extent unknown.  Given the threats that have been made he fears for his life and safety.  \n\tMy submission is that that particular fear is well-founded given the circumstances that are prevailing at this point in time.  My submission is that in view of the threats and the belief that he entertains that his life is in danger, that his request that his evidence be held in camera be entertained.  \n\tMy submission would be to exclude the media and members of the public, but given the antagonism that exists which we don't want to fuel and to avoid any unnecessary prejudice, we would only ask for the exclusion of those two categories.  In other words we would say that the victims or their next-of-kin can be present.  So all we are asking for at the end of the day is two categories to be, or rather all categories to be excluded save for victims and/or their next-of-kin.  As it pleases you Mr Chairman.",

In other words, did you in fact as it were promote Mr Gushu to an MK commander?  I don't have clarity on that.",
