            "Thank you Chairperson. Good morning everybody.  This morning I thought I would set the tone so to speak by remembering those doctors who couldn't walk away from it.  I think this is an important occasion to help us do a critical analysis of our past behaviour and I say more broadly, particularly in the field of human rights, to do an honest assessment, not only looking at individual behaviour but also examining those policies, structures and procedures that enable the perpetration of those gross human rights violations, particularly in the health sector.\n First I want to pay tribute. Dr Mvuya Tom, Dr Abe Nkomo, Dr Aaron Mac Claury(?), Dr Rafiek Ismaela(?), Dr Ndeleza Mjee(?), Dr Joe Viriaver(?), Sister Madelaine Tshabalala, and many many others of you for whom the floor was frequently your surgical table, for whom improvisation was your practice art, for whom life was very dangerous just by the act of intervening.  Many of you were detained just for intervening, many of you were tortured, many of you were harassed.  \n My tribute to Black doctors is not to take away or demean what was contributed by doctors in the broader South African community, but it is a special tribute because they couldn't walk away from it you see, they were part of the morass, part of the pain, part of the struggle and overriding all of that was the question of caring even under very difficult circumstances.   \n To all South African doctors, both Black and White, it is arrogant of me to remind us that caring is more important, much more important than State objectives, that our patients are much more important than the security of the State, and that perhaps as we look to the way forward that we'll learn from our past experiences and our past behaviour and that we make a strong strong commitment that our patients come first.\n I want to read some excerpts from some of the letters we received, and this will be done throughout the day, just a few excerpts.  The first is from the Harvard School of Health, Centre for Health and Human Rights.\n\"The Francois Xavier Centre for Health and Human Rights at the Harvard School of Public Health supports the process of examination and the search for the truth.  The systematic structural conditions which enable human rights or violations to go unchecked must be brought to light. We believe that the call for accountability by the health institutions and professionals will serve as a model for such work around the world.  Knowing that this process will be painful and difficult at times, but ultimately will create an environment in which all live from human rights violations is what makes this endeavour so worthwhile.  We extend our utmost support to the work of the Commission\".\nAn excerpt from Johan S.Veer Stigting (?) Foundation for Health and Human Rights, \n\"We believe that your hearings will constitute a milestone in the history of the health profession which surpasses the interests of South Africa. We wish you much success in conducting these hearings\".\nAn excerpt from the World Federation of Mental Health:\n\"It is regrettable that the WFMH is unable to directly be represented at the hearings, but I am sure that the members of the Federation worldwide will await with keen interest to hear about the outcome of the deliberations.  On behalf of the WMFH I wish to extend the strongest support to the hearings.  We trust that your deliberations will be fruitful and assist in the process of reconciliation in South Africa.  I have no doubt that the WMFH would be more than willing to participate in any further activities initiated by the hearings\".\n And finally for this part of the morning, a letter from the Province of KwaZulu Natal Health Services, the Minister's Office:\n\"We should be especially vigilant in the health care field.  Our aim must be to always provide care and comfort for those who turn to us for help.  We must ensure we are not maltreated, abused or corrupted by their contact with us. To be able to do that we have to be aware of the shortcomings of the past, of how systems have been manipulated and what motivators drove the causes of evil. We need the truth, not for retribution but for reconciliation and for the capacity to build a better system, better processes and procedures so that the people whom the health sector serves are accorded the attention and support they deserve. It is my hope that by exposing the short-comings of the past, we'll be able to create a future in which all health care providers are viewed with trust as people of compassion, integrity and skill.\n I wish you all the very best in your deliberations today.\nChairperson, excerpts will be read throughout the day from all the different letters we received and thank you very much.",

            "Thank you Dr Ramashala.  Can I call the MASA delegation to the table.  And whilst they are doing that can I say that after yesterday's experiences we are going to be fairly strict today.  I know everybody in the audience does not have the respective submissions being made.  So I'm asking the delegations to cover the important points in your documents.  Time limits have been set down on the timetable and I'm going to actually be fairly strict on keeping people to those times today for several reasons.  I certainly don't think I want to actually have a situation like yesterday where we're going well beyond our time.\n Secondly, many of you have come here today to participate in the workshop at the end of the hearings and I'm sure many of you want to get back to your respective homes. So in order to give that meeting the respect it deserves, we need to finish all the proceedings at the right time.  \n So please don't be affronted if I intervene when my colleagues and panel are leading you but I don't think we're going to get through the timetable unless we do that today.

            "Thank you very much Chairperson, Councillors, thank you very much for giving us the privilege of being with you at this very important occasion in the last two days.  We are extremely concerned about the past and spending the whole day with you yesterday it was something which all of us have thought about very deeply before and do so now as well.  I am, as Dr Barker said, the Chairman of the Federal Council of the Medical Association.  I also have the privilege of being the president of the World Medical Association.\n MASA is a voluntary professional organisation of medical doctors. There are approximately 27 000 doctors registered with the interim National Medical and Dental Council at present, some 21 000 of these are practising doctors and 14 000 of them have chosen to voluntarily affiliate with the Medical Association of South Africa. The Association's mission is to empower doctors to bring health to the nation.  The association must certainly not be confused with the Interim Medical and Dental Council, a statutory body in place for the State to protect the community through licensing education and the maintenance of standards with disciplinary powers to act against doctors for unprofessional conduct.\n On the 24th of January 1996 following an international meeting on the caring of survivors of torture which took place in November 1995 which I've tendered on behalf of both MASA and WMA, the Secretary General of MASA wrote to the TRC as follows:\n\"MASA wishes you and the Commission every success in achieving your objectives. One tragic event was the death of Mr Steve Biko.  MASA does not have any specific new information.  However should it be required MASA will be pleased to cooperate in giving the Commission access to all records and documentation at our disposal, or make such available at your request\".\n The first current collection of important documents surrounding  MASA and Human Rights was published in an article in the South African Medical Journal of September 1996.  Immediately following the publication MASA approached Miss L Louw, a master of Philosophy student with an honours degree in Psychology as its researcher. Ms Louw was given carte blanche to go through any of the MASA files and archives to gather any material related to human rights.  After four months she collected a substantial amount of documentation which was presented and is presented today in MASA's submission to the TRC. MASA members have been on both sides of the spectrum, some have been perpetrators of human rights violations and others have been victims.  Some have campaigned to advance human rights and others have been complacent.  The complete submission attempts to cover the role which MASA as an organisation played in Human Rights development. \n Just briefly I want to mention the question of the World Medical Association and MASA and I want to refer to the visit of the World Medical Association to Somerset West last October and the opening address by Mr Thabo Mbeki, the Deputy President of South Africa.  He said,\n\"In June 1995 the Medical Association of South Africa adopted a resolution with unreserved apology to persons within and outside the Medical Profession who might in the past have been hurt or offended by any acts of omission or commission on its part in the past\".\n In his statement the chairperson of the Federal Council of MASA mentioned some of the issues on which MASA has remained silent and had been insensitive and indifferent and went on to commit MASA to broadening access to quality health care for all the people in South Africa.  \n It was an important announcement and MASA deserves credit for having made it.  The point was also correctly made that the notion that it should be a beacon pointing the way to the completion of our transition, indeed much work remains to be done merely to deal with the legacy of the past. And that serves why we're here today.\n I'd like now with your permission to ask Dr Barker who's our main spokesman in the submission.  Thank you.",

            "Dr Randera, Commissioners, forgive me if I read again.  This is for the sake of keeping within time and to ensure that we get my message across exactly as I want it to come out.\n At the outset of today's proceedings concerning the Medical Association of South Africa, I would like to make a personal statement regarding my own position in appearing before you to present the Association's submission.  My position here could be seen by some people to be equivocal and I would like to explain why I have accepted personally this onerous and rather necessary task.  The present day MASA has taken upon itself the task of examining the history of the organisation in an effort to uncover and disclose human rights abuses which arose by commission or omission by the MASA under apartheid.\n As one of the members of the Association who was active at the time in opposing a range of decisions and policies of the MASA as it then existed and in the period covered by this submission, I am in a position to explain and elucidate to the Truth Commission the matters covered by the submission document.  \n The membership of the present organisation, approximately two thirds of whom were not even qualified at the time of Steve Biko's death, have taken on responsibility for examining the darker side of the history of the Association.  While the MASA of today is a vastly different institution from the MASA as it existed under the period of examination, the present membership recognises that the history which it has inherited requires full exploration and disclosure.  Collective responsibility for this history has to be accepted before the organisation can be freed of the burden of the past and move forward to fulfil its role in the life of the community. \n Before I go on to address the substance of our submission document, I would like to make one extremely important correction of fact relating to something that appears in our submission.  It relates to the decision by the Federal Council of MASA in 1974 to prohibit the South African Medical Journal from accepting advertisements for professional appointments that can contained any terms discriminating between doctors on grounds of race or colour.  This is mentioned on page 37 of the document.  However paragraph two on page 38 states that MASA decided to amend rule 19, which was a rule limiting advertising for professional appointments to professional journals only.  The documents state that this amendment was made by MASA in order to ease the difficulties for the government which was then unable to advertise State posts with a racial criteria.\n Now this is a grave error.  This fact is simply not what happened.  Rule 19 was in fact a rule of the statutory body, the South African Medical and Dental Council and it was this body which amended the rule in order to rescue the government to allow it to continue making discriminatory appointments. The MASA stuck to its policy and since 1974 has never again accepted discriminatory advertisements.\n Now I make this correction, not because I believe it's part of my submission today to tell you about any of the good things which MASA has done in the past, MASA has done some good things, this is not what we're concerned with today, the only reason I have made this statement about this factual correction is that I believe it's equally important that MASA not be asked to accept blame, guilt for things which it did not do, such as for example the impression created by this.\n And now Mr Chairman, to go on to my main presentation.  It's not going to be possible for us, there's a 104 pages of detailed fact in the submission and there is no possibility in the time available for me to cover this.  What I want to do is to give an overview of what we have tried to do, how we approach the subject, what our intentions are and then make as much time available as possible for questions from the Commissioners who would like to elucidate matters and we'd be very happy to answer.\n Now MASA as such was always, without doubt, a part of the White establishment in South Africa, and for the most part and in most contexts it shared the world view and the political beliefs of that establishment. Inescapably it also shared the misdeeds and the sins for which that establishment was responsible.  From the time of its inception in 1927 until the day that Steve Biko died, the \nAssociation flirted along in terms of human rights and its approach to human responsibilities in a fairly unconscious and unremarkable fashion with a few issues being taken up such as, for example, its repeated calls for the abolition of discriminatory differences and the salaries paid to doctors of different race groups.  These efforts were not immediately successful, it took many years to achieve parity.  \n Apart from these the Association in general was quite comfortable with the status quo and its public reaction to any criticism of the inequity and the iniquities in society, particularly the inequities in health care delivery was to dismiss that criticism as the work of enemies of the State and defined all sorts of means to defend itself and the system.\n The death of Steve Biko, and particularly the circumstances surrounding his death, in which members of the medical profession were clearly and shockingly involved was the event which rocked this complacency  and started to force the Association to examine the ethics and the morality of its actions in many different contexts.  \n The Association was initially able to resist calls from within and without its ranks and for the actions of the doctors concerned in the Biko death to be investigated and judged on the grounds that an inquest was to be held and that justice demanded that any action that preempted this inquest would be unjust. When the findings of the inquest magistrate were released, the clamour started up again for MASA to take action in the name of the honour of the profession and it's claim to be the upholder and guardian of professional ethical standards.\n The Association again resisted these calls, again on the grounds that the matter had now been referred to the Medical Council for investigation and was therefore still sub judice.  \n When the Council finally, two and a half years later, issued the findings of its committee of preliminary inquiry which, astonishingly, and unbelievably, absolved the doctors concerned from any blame, the fires of controversy really flared up. Under growing pressure from vociferous protest, among which I participated fairly actively, again from within and without its ranks to publicly reject and to condemn the Medical Council's indefensible finding, which seemed to simply ignore the evidence given at the inquest, the Association was finally faced with its moment of truth.   It had the opportunity to rise to the occasion and to meet the challenge to demonstrate it's commitment to truth, to equity, to justice and the centuries old tradition of professional honour.  It not only failed to respond to the challenge and thereby betrayed the values for which it supposedly stood, but the leadership of the time then mounted a vigorous nationwide propaganda campaign to make sure that the membership of the Association followed its lead in this matter.  \n However, this sad and disgraceful episode marked the beginning of a movement within the Association, a movement of opposition to the actions and attitudes of the then leadership of the Association which haltingly and with many setbacks and failures finally grew powerful enough so that by 1989, it was quite clear that the Association had set its feet firmly on the road of renewal and transformation. \n Our written submission details the many failures and compromises that occurred along the way, failures of will and courage, compromises founded on expediency, many of these occurring even in the years since 1989.  It's not possible in the time available today to explore in detail all the misdeeds of commission and especially of omission that have been detailed in our written submission. However I can assure the Commission that we have made every possible effort to provide as complete and as honest a disclosure as it lies in our power to do.  \n I plead with you and with the Nation, that this submission be accepted with respect for the truth which it embodies.  It is vital for the Association, at this point in its development, its renewal and its transformation, to achieve reconciliation, and this can only happen if there has been full disclosure and full acknowledgement of all the wrongs of the past.  If there are gaps or omissions in this submission, they are unintentional. We would welcome any input in this regard from whatever quarter it may come.\n The transformation of MASA of which I speak is an ongoing process. A significant event along the way was the unconditional apology for the past wrongs of the Association that was made in June 1995.  We stand by every word that was spoken in that apology.  However there are those who understood this apology to be an attempt on the part of the Association to achieve what they termed blanket amnesty and to sweep everything else from our past under the carpet. This was far from the intention of that apology.  The apology was a necessary step along the road we are travelling, but it was only a step.  Our wholehearted participation in the work of this Commission is yet another step on this road, but again only a step.  \n In terms of the way forward there is much that we have done to make sure that the wrongs perpetrated in the past by doctors can never occur again, but there is much that remains to be done.  We intend to participate fully in the work of the proposed over-arching Health and Human Rights Organisation.  We propose to enlarge and to strengthen the office and the activities of our ombudsman, our public protector. Our peer review system has already been sharpened and structured much more effectively than it ever was before. We are currently engaged in a programme designed to promote structured ethics education in all the medical schools in this country and we are planning formal structured training for prisons' health service personnel. \n However, in all these efforts we still find ourselves hampered by the huge baggage of past wrongs that the Association has had to drag along with itself and from which it has found it impossible to free itself.  It will only be through the process of truthful disclosure and reconciliation that we will finally be freed from the burden of this baggage.\n And Mr Chairman I now would welcome questions.",

            "Dr Barker I want to just come to one point of the segregated hospital issue, the separate facilities for training.  In your own document you refer firstly to a resolution that was passed in 1970, I think by the Tanzanian Medical Association at the Commonwealth Conference and then subsequently a resolution passed at the 1973 World Medical Association again critical of what was happening in South Africa in terms of health services and the role that the organisation played. Now both you and Dr Mandell have been part of this organisation for a long time.  We need to understand what happened in that period.  Dr Ramashala has already referred to the responsibilities of health professionals being one of caring and speaking out when that is being contradicted.\n Given, and again going back through your document, there was a letter written by doctors from the Medical School in Natal in the '60's, raising the question of discriminatory practices.  I accept that you say that the organisation has always been open in terms of its membership, but yet there were glaring examples throughout this 29-year period that we're talking about, and why was it that it actually took the Association such a long time to come out with clear policies when you were clearly interacting not only within the country but outside the country as well.  I accept again when you say that other medical associations also didn't take a political position on issues, but yet at these international conferences MASA was being criticised, can you comment on that?",

            "Yes Mr Chairman, as I stated at the beginning of my presentation, MASA was essentially a part of the White establishment with, and it shared by and large, not entirely, but it's membership by and large shared the world views, the political views, political attitudes of the White establishment in this country which regarded the sorts of criticisms which you've mentioned as motivated by enmity to the country as part of what later came to be known as the 'total onslaught'.  The total onslaught mentality was certainly extant and operative in the White South African context in those days and the explanation for this lies in an understanding of where the White population of this country stood in relation to all these matters.\n The other point is that it took a long long time for those of us who recognised the difference between problems of ethics and morality and problems of politics, but there was a vast difference between the two large numbers of members. Very large numbers of our members for a long, long time failed to see any difference.  A political stance, even though it might be based upon what moral basis, if it was antagonistic to the current status quo, the actions of the country or particularly the Association or the Profession, this was regarded as an attack and was opposed with vigour.  This of course was completely wrong. It was not what doctors should have been doing, but it took a long, long time, certainly up to 1989, before those of us who had for years been trying to make the right noises and persuade the Association that ethical behaviour in relationship to the population it left their patients in relation to the structure of health care had nothing to do with politics and should be a concern of all \nmembers of the Association no matter what their associations.  It was only from 1989 onwards that we had sufficient support among our membership to be able to drive this forward.",

            "Just to add to what Dr Barker said, on page 95 of our submission I think there is a specific answer to your question which is very clear that these deeply ingrained discriminatory attitudes pervaded our society and MASA did not escape them.  MASA tolerated a system in which doctors  treated patients and colleagues differently based on the colour of their skin.  MASA was so wrapped up in its White male elitist educated professional world as individuals and as a collective organisation, and as part of a broader society from which doctors were drawn, that it failed to see the need to treat all people as equal human beings.  Perhaps the same could be said of other groupings in society.  MASA allowed Black and White people to be treated differently and this is the form of human rights violations for which it stands disgraced. I think it's very clearly stipulated in where we come from and I think this part of our submission also answered the question that you raised.",

Now the leadership at that time, I believe, felt, were told, felt for themselves that if these doctors were to be found guilty it would create such a furore for the Health Department and for the Government itself, for the Security Police, for everything that it had to be damped down and smoothed over as effectively as possible.\n Now there was a huge outcry and as you say you've read the journals, there were letters from all the provinces, from all the branches, lots and lots and an enormous amount of correspondence received by the journal which has only now this month been published, a whole lot which was not published by the journal, load of letters and the then Chairman of Council undertook a whistle-stop tour of all the branches in the country, he addressed them all making an impassioned plea to the membership please to support that they couldn't possibly question the integrity of people on the Medical Council. It was unthinkable that doctors of that standing could remotely have their integrity impugned, which was these wild people writing these subversive letters were trying to do.\n He managed to convince meetings held at every branch to express support for the position of the then MASA executive with one exception, he came to the Natal Coastal Branch and this was the only branch in the country that refused to accept his plea that while he was there, rejected, passed a resolution rejecting first of all dissociating itself from the SAMDC finding and rejecting the action of the executive in approving this, demanding that the executive in fact altered its stance, and this was basically an explanation of what was going on then.",

The specific reaction at the end of the day and what the Federal Council did, and this was in the early days when I had become a Federal Council then was the special meeting of the Federal Council which was held on the 12th of November 1980 to discuss these issues and what the reaction of the Federal Council was going to be to the outcry of which Dr Barker speaks.  There was a considerable debate and one must also remember that there were four members of that Federal Council who were also members of the Medical and Dental Council at that particular time, one of whom was the chairman of the Council too, and they paid considerable attention to what those councillors, the members of the Medical Council had to say at the meeting of the Federal Council.  There's no doubt whatsoever that the Federal Council was attempting to avoid a direct confrontation with the South African Medical and Dental Council for the major reason and that was the destruction of the Medical Association itself, if they had adopted a policy at that stage of condemning the Medical Council.  They didn't face up to it, and I was one of them at that particular time, didn't face up to the reality of this.  Each one of the members of that Federal Council represented a branch, it was purely at that particular time branch representation.  They represented the interests of those particular branches and as we rightly have here, the outcry came from certain branches, but at the other branches they wished to maintain the status quo and not upset anything that might have happened, whether it was government inspired or whether it was the Council itself.  They did not take that action, they found a compromise, what they believed was a compromise to examine detention, to examine children in detention, and that was as far as they were prepared to go to accept some committee which would examine these issues rather than face the possible destruction of the Association.",

That was our position from 1990 onwards and a demand which we made repeatedly and it was only finally acceded to by Minister Venter I think in about 1993, that she finally conceded and the hospitals throughout the Republic were open to all races.

In some section you talk about MASA has not committed gross human rights violations, and in others you look at the different degrees of conspiracy, complicity, and even of human rights violations,  MASA was not any time directly involved in conspiracy or complicity.  There are different sections where one picks up this contradiction as to what exactly is your position.\n My specific question is that under this section where we look at MASA and human rights violations, in view of the fact that we are at the phase where we're all working towards transformation but the essential stage is the establishment of the truth, I would have liked a document where you have made a careful assessment of what went wrong and actually documented, as a vehicle for transforming this professional grouping, and I think that would be very, very important in view of the documents whereby other organisations like NAMDA and other progressive structures actually embarked on a campaign internationally that MASA be one of those professional bodies who should be isolated.

Please feel free to go ahead and present your submission and then we will address the questions after the oral presentation.  Thank you.",

            "Thank you.  Honourable Chairperson, honourable members of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, we from the South African Interim Nursing Council feel humbled to be allowed an opportunity to come and make the presentation we came to make today.  My colleagues and I decided that I be the one to make the submission but that we, at the same time, should make this hearing aware that I make this submission as one of those within the South African Interim Nursing Council who represents the community.  That is because amongst other things, the South African Interim Nursing Council stands for the interests of the community and therefore has set the means in place to solicit, accommodate and give expression to the needs of the community visa a vis matters of health, if not just matters of nursing.\n Chairperson given the horrific picture yielded by the picture of our beloved country, which picture permeates all spheres of life and all classes of professions, it may well be conceivable that normal people will embark on a spontaneous effort to try and dissociate themselves as much as possible from the past.\n Concomitant to such a mindset we find a tendency to spare people on in a campaign, a campaign to forget about the past, yes to forget all even before we get to fully understand what it is exactly that should be forgotten.  We therefore come here today with a vivid realisation that denials, excuses and explanations will not take this country anywhere.  At the same time we are thankful because today everybody can speak, reveal and uncover.  Yes we are all free to speak today.  The former oppressors and the formerly oppressed, all alike.  \n It is with that in mind that we wish to borrow the wisdom of on who was with us yesterday in this very room who once declared in years gone past and if he himself was quoting someone else, then I don't know yet, but I heard him declare and I quote, \"no one shall be free until all are free\".  We note with an immense measure of gratitude that the very temporary failures of the past very strongly form a firm basis for the successes of today and the same shall apply for the future successes.\n Oh yes, the temporary failures, more especially of those who tried from positions of weakness to fight against a tide, a tide that enjoyed the benefit of the wherewithal to oppress, to maim and to vilify, indeed to brainwash and to abuse, they risked their all to resist segregation, social biases, disempowerment and a whole range of other negative eventualities that of course would be denied from time-to-time.  But today, through the grace of God, those temporary failures do not seem to stop in getting transformed into great successes, successes that now spur some of us on into speaking up.\n Chairperson, nursing as a profession did not and perhaps could not have escaped this erstwhile wide web of racial biases.  Nursing with its militaristic approach to both training and the shaping of the nurses work environment ended up perhaps like many other health-related establishments as one of the tools tailored to suite the whims of the authorities of the day.  Consequently it should come as no surprise that the Nursing Council, from it's own corner, also contributed in giving form and direction to these temporary failures that we speak about.  \n However Chairperson the evolvement of these temporary failures gives us such a strong feeling of redemption, it reminds us once more of the words of someone who once said, and I quote, \n\"It is better to fail temporarily even if it is a million times on a course that is bound to ultimately succeed, than to succeed temporarily, even if it is a million times on a course that is bound to ultimately fail\".\n Chairperson, the South African Interim Nursing Council came into being in August the 23rd 1995, and we make the following submission primarily on behalf of former South African nursing councils.  We also make the same submission on behalf of the nursing councils in the former areas of Transkei, Ciskei and Bophuthatswana.  We note that we have inherited a process within which perceptions were created which suggested a perpetuation, if not support active or by way of omission of certain circumstances.  \n We further acknowledge and accept without justification that Council was influenced by the policies of the government of the day.  This could have resulted in both a conscious and unconscious perpetuation of those discriminatory policies and legislation leading to gross violations of human rights. \n We are aware that Council was all the time morally bound to adhere to a strict professional approach to matters of nursing without allowing itself to be used as a tool of the apartheid machinery.\n We also appreciate that Council could have at times exercised a free discretion on some of the issues.  We therefore wish to apologise unreservedly, both for conscious and unconscious activities, that could have the effect of undermining human rights from time to time.  We however acknowledge that some of the Council members have from time to time tried their best to rid the Council of any apartheid overtones but they would time and again be steamrollered into a collusion because of the circumstances of the day.\n Having indicated our awareness of instances perpetuating apartheid, we wish to bring into light some of the known incidents by way of highlighting areas of failures and the areas of success vis a vis the Council under an apartheid regime. \n Regarding failures, and I'll come up with failures resulting from legislation and policies:\n1. As prescribed by the segregationist nursing legislation of 1957, Council kept separate registers and rolls in respect of different population groups.\n 2. Only White persons could serve within Council with a result that nurses of other colours could not participate in making decisions that affect their profession.  See in that respect, Section 4, subsection 1(c) of Act No. 69 of 1957.  \n 3. While Council was aware that there was segregation in health treatment along colour lines visciating against the Nurses Pledge, they apparently made no effort to protest against the system.        \n 4. Where, with the aid of press reports and other sources of information, where through those sources we became aware that victims of accidents were denied emergency treatment on the same because for their colour, there is no evidence to suggest that Council made any effort to confront the situation.   \n 5. Surrogate nursing councils were established by the Homeland governments without the consultation of nurses in homelands.  These tended to undermine the professional status and international recognition of these nurses.  \n In other instances nurses in Homelands ended up having to pay dual fees to better their situation.  Those councils commenced without any financial support to assist them.  Whereas Council was not responsible for the formation of these surrogate councils, Council failed to protest against the fragmentation of the profession along tribal divides.  \n 6. Council failed to react to gross inequalities in the provision of training facilities for various population groups.\n 7. Where inspection results revealed a dire lack of facilities at educational institutions and training hospitals, Council failed to do more than just bring this to the attention of the authorities.  This situation was more prevalent in Black hospitals.\n 8. Where former political prisoners and detainees made allegations against nurses in prisons and other hospitals, the Council failed to conduct proper investigations.  Council would investigate only if complaints were laid.  We know now as much as we knew then that most of the victims would not have known how and where to lodge their complaints.\n 9. Council failed to create a user-friendly image in dealing with professional conduct issues.  This resulted in a near militaristic approach to the situation of the nurse.  In most instances nurses were not empowered to know and exercise their rights.  Many could not afford legal representation.  Seemingly many of them also did not trust the pro forma complainant to protect their interests.\n 10. From 1960 to 1978 Council continued to apply the Nursing Act No 69 of 1957.  This Act had the effect of introducing harsh apartheid measures into the control of the nursing profession.  For example,\na. Section 12(4) of this Act provided that separate registers and rolls be kept for different population groups.\n b. Section 4(1)(c) provided that membership of the Council be limited to Whites. The result was that other racial groups were denied a say in matters affecting their profession. \n c. Section 3 limited voting to White members of the Profession. \n d. Section 49 made it a criminal offence for a White nurse to be put under the supervision of a nurse belonging to other race groups.\n Regarding Communication. -   The Nursing Council failed dismally in terms of communicating issues to the members of the Profession, the communities and all stakeholders.  This resulted in the Council being seen as dwelling in an ivory tower remote from the profession and those it was supposed to serve.      \n Regarding Staff Appointments -  \n1.  Appointments of staff in the categories of typists, clerks and upwards were almost exclusively limited to Whites. There was no deliberate effort at all on the part of the Council to empower members of the disadvantaged communities.\n 2.  Although there was no deliberate policy promoting job reservation, Council's requirements for employment, namely the minimum qualifications being standard 8 for appointment as a typist clerk, and secondly fluency in English or Afrikaans, these things tended to exclude many would be and actual applicants who could otherwise have succeeded.  \n We felt that maybe it is a little bit worthwhile to make mention of some of the legal successes there have been down the years and we are very conscious that we do this at the risk of sounding a sort of jakkels prys sy eie stert kind of a note.  But we felt we should do this because in every battle and in every struggle there is the concept of the unknown soldier who is not there to speak for himself, and we felt we should not end up undermining the efforts of those who tried because the features of the unknown soldiers are not much more in the successes but I think what should be taken into regard is much more the decision to try under very, very hard circumstances. \n And I want to begin with the legal successes by way of excuse, Honourable Chair, but just for the record.\n Nursing Education:  Although the Council in terms of the Nursing Act of 1957 kept separate registers and rolls for the different population groups, its educational programmes were the same for all trainees, thus ensuring a uniform standard of education and training throughout the country.  This standard is so high that South African-trained Nurses enjoyed international recognition.  \n The Council's Database:  The Council has always kept an excellent database of details regarding all nurses, both in training and qualified. This is of great assistance to the Department of Health when planning its nursing manpower to meet the country's health needs.\n Constitution of the Council:  In the Nursing Act No 50 of 1978 provision was made for the election as council members of five White nurses, three Black nurses, one Coloured nurse and one Indian nurse.  In 1989 the Council petitioned the Department of Health to remove all references to racial groups in the Act.  The motivation was that the Council is a professional body which does not distinguish between population groups inasfar as training, registration or professional standards are concerned. This resulted in the Nursing Amendment Act of 1992, which made the Council a totally non-racial body.\n The Nursing of Prisoners and Detainees: And before I come to this I just want to make a legal comment about constitution.  We are aware that there are other concerns and it has to do with gender balances within the Council, it would seem it's female-dominated, if I may put it that way, it is a concern that is being looked at and I always say, they went to Beijing, maybe we should also go to Taipei.\n The Nursing of Prisoners and Detainees: In 1988 the Council issued a policy document dealing with this issue, including political prisoners. The following extracts from the policy are highlighted:    \n\"In her professional capacity the nurse maintains political neutrality.  Any deviation from this is unethical because such impartiality provides the basis for mutual trust, respect and protection of the rights of the patient are indivisibly linked to the duties and responsibilities of the nurse towards such a patient\".\n The following principal does apply:\n It is the professional obligation of the nurse to provide life-saving care and alleviation of pain and suffering.  \n The patient has the right to the protection of his physical and mental health and whatever treatment and nursing are needed.  \n The nurse may not be involved in any relationship with a prisoner or detainee other than that required to evaluate, protect or improve his physical or mental health.  \n It is unethical for the nurse to participate in any procedure for restraining a prisoner or detainee unless medical grounds exist for such procedure in order to protect the physical or mental health of the prisoner or detainee or of these fellow prisoners or detainees.\n It is unethical for the nurse to participate in any form of interrogation or torture of a prisoner or detainee.   In the case of torture it is unethical for the nurse to conceal knowledge thereof.\nAnd finally,\nRecommendations\na. Further Councils should ensure that no legislation or policy violates the rights and dignity of any nurse or any patient.\n b. The Council should promote the preservation of the image, dignity, integrity and values of the Nursing Profession.\n c. Openness and transparency, the right to be heard, accessibility and user-friendliness should be the fundamental premises to realise the role and functions of the Council based on exhibitions, vision and goals.\n d. Communication with the Profession and the community should be improved and intensified.\n e. The autonomy of the Council should be maintained and respected.\n f. In the event of victims of Council violations being identified, Council recommends that appropriate reparations be made for the benefit of such victims. \n We also recommend that nurses should be encouraged to report human rights violations directly to Council.\nAnd lastly,\nWith regard to any future collaboration platforms, if any are being mooted, we recommend that such platforms should be geared not to facilitate with regard to advisory resources to avoid stifling the all-important autonomy of the individual professions, more especially the Nursing Profession.\n The Council would like to reiterate its apology to anyone who may have suffered unjustly as a result of former councils' actions and policies. Appreciation is also expressed to the Commission for the opportunity to make this submission.  Thank you.",

One needs to remember that the South African Nursing Council in this country was instituted through the work of the old South African Nursing Association, the South Association for Trained Nurses, SAATNA. So historically there was a close collaboration between the two bodies.  As a matter of fact, when the Nursing Council was instituted in 1944 it did so with a\nPS1 000 that the Nursing Association gave to it to start its work with, and over the years the leaders serving on the Nursing Association were almost naturally also members of the South African Nursing Council.  This persisted for some 30 years.  But over the past 10 years there's been a marked division that developed naturally between the two bodies, so that at the moment I don't think there's a single, and for the past five to six, seven years, there has not been a single member serving on the Association as well as on the Council.  \n So I think historically it's worked itself out and particularly with the factor of voluntary membership of the Nursing Association, that close relationship has been broken. \n So yes, there were the effects and definitely there were conflicts and there was dissatisfaction amongst the professional members and the profession down at the ground because of this.

Nurses are striking, they are dissatisfied with what's going on in the health services because of the poor conditions under which they work and the Council has always taken a stand against that and only regarded the interests of the patient in this regard. \n Now Council realises that a lot of dissatisfaction among the members of the profession is there because of the poor conditions under which nurses work.  For that reason there's proposed amendment of the Nursing Act to make it possible for Council to also inspect the conditions going on in health services in order to make recommendations and to help nurses with regard to that.  \n So that the emphasis will in future not only on the interests of the community but also on the interests of the nurse and the rights of the nurse to have the facilities and the conditions worthy of to give proper care to the community. \n So there's a definite shift in emphasis in the approach of Council towards its own image and the image of the profession.",

My question really moves beyond professional structures but around the human rights and patient care. In those settings we have heard people coming before the Commission talking about how they died in the hands of nurses, mainly because the nurses were from the neighbourhood and they knew them very well.  There were divisions, ideological differences and I was wondering whether you are aware of those problems in the Nursing Profession?\n And if you are aware as to whether you have thought of any possible rehabilitation programmes which might assist those nurses who found themselves in the position where they will be influenced by their ideological persuasions in caring for people who appear before the health (...indistinct)?",

            "Chairperson just on that point.  We have heard today, from yesterday, that in the health system there was a sort of a relationship and a link in the way in which human violations were done on the patients.  This link was not only basically facing the nurse, the psychologist or anybody or the doctor, it was also the question that some nurses became aware of these abuses but because of the linkage in the system between the professional organisations, councils, it was very difficult for the nurse to come forward with these abuses.  Like we don't have a tangible project to say we have in the Council as part of a healing.\n But another way that prevented nurses from reporting these violations was the mechanism, a system of management in the hospitals.  That is why now in our recommendation, part of what we are doing as part of transformation is to have the Council accessible to all nurses from the ground and up to national so that the nurse herself is able to directly get in touch with the Council for whatever violations that could be there, without working through the mechanism of authorities within institutions like superintendents and nursing managers.  The Council is now accessible to the nurse.  There is communication that is on the ground.  The Council has opened up issues with professional organisations like unions so that these organisations, together with the nurses and the Council, should be aware and if they are aware they know that there is a forum for them to report these violations. \n So there is a concerted effort from the Council to be more open than before to work issues together, although in the true sense we haven't got on the ground an idea of a project for healing of the nurses themselves, but we have opened up a line to communicate directly with the Council.

Can I just ask, noting your reference to the approach of your predecessor to professional conduct issues as near militaristic and also noting your apology to those who may have suffered as a result of the actions taken by your predecessor, are you possibly engaged in a process of trying to identify cases where disciplinary action against nurses was unjust in nature, which would amount, as we understand it today as violation of human rights because it was political in nature, because it was racist?

The Council's Professional Conduct hearings have always been open to the public and in fact up until fairly recently invitations were even sent out to training schools and to hospitals.  Nurses have always been allowed to have legal representation even though obviously many of them could not afford so. So that the actual hearings, the transcripts of the hearings, I don't think would indicate the Council acted against somebody on racial grounds.  Again I'm not saying that individual members of the old disciplinary committees weren't biased in their own way but it 's certainly in the 15 years that I've been with the Council they never came through as such and if it had I wouldn't have stayed 15 years.\n It's an interesting thought that you suggest that one does research into the past to see if nurses' rights have been violated in any way and then to see in what way reparation can be made to them by the Council.",

Our work included a wide variety of clinical duties at the hospital, teaching of primary health care nurses, working as district surgeons and a responsibility for community work in a district of 70 000 people.\n With regards to Human Rights abuses, we would take as a starting point that the right to basic health care is a fundamental human right.  Anything which prevented access to basic health care could be construed as a human rights abuse and we will describe factors which undermined the provision of health care.  We'll also describe situations in which health care available was abusive in some way.\n The first point is the institutional neglect of rural homelands.  The homelands of the apartheid era, largely situated in rural areas were dumping grounds of people.  As doctors we dealt on a daily basis with the ill health and disease suffered by large numbers of mostly illiterate, poor and marginalised people.  This is primarily the reason we've chosen to make this submission to the TRC in order to make known the plight of vast numbers of forgotten people who lived desperately on the edges of extreme poverty in harsh environments and battling with effects of diseases such as malaria, measles, bilharzia, TB, typhoid, aids. The marginalisation of rural people continues to this day and we believe that it is an urgent priority that this be redressed under the new dispensation.\n When I was asked to make this oral submission, I was specifically told to just focus on rural private practice abuses and leave out all the other stuff and in fact I've specifically not done that because I feel like that, it's part of the general attitude that rural health is just a non-issue, it's peripheral, it's not a big priority.  So that's why I'm speaking about my whole submission although I'll try to keep it to 15 minutes.\nInadequate funding of rural health services.\nRural health services have been chronically underfunded relative to equivalent urban facilities because they're conveniently out of sight and out of mind.

            "The general shortage of health care workers",
            ".\nA well functioning health team needs to be comprised of a whole range of professionals such as nurses, doctors, therapists, lab technicians, pharmacists and dentists. At no time while we worked at the Bethesda was there ever such a team.  This is problematic for the following reasons:\n In rural areas there are large numbers of people who are disabled and require physiotherapy and occupational therapy for example.  It's an area where the mysterious Msileni(?) joint disease occurs. \n We only had an occupational therapist for one year in 1993. \n A dentist visited once a week for six months in the entire time.  Otherwise the only dental care available was provided by the doctors who taught each other to do tooth extractions.  \n There was never a trained pharmacist employed at the hospital.  The laboratory was always short-staffed which had serious implications for the work in an area where there were a large number of epidemic diseases such as malaria, TB, bilharzia, typhoid and others.  \n There was an ongoing shortage of nurses.  This resulted in much of the work which should have been done by professional nurses being done by staff nurses who were compelled by the circumstances to function far beyond their scope of practice.\n The South African Nursing Council would not  have been pleased if they had known about these irregularities but we didn't think they particularly cared what happened.\nThe shortage of doctors.\n One of the main reasons why rural communities did not have adequate basic health care is that there were not enough doctors working in rural areas.  As we all know there's a severe maldistribution of doctors in South Africa.  The vast majority live and work in urban areas.  The reason for this are  multifactorial.  \n However, we would highlight the following reasons as ones which could have been managed differently.  \n Firstly incentives.  The Department of Health provided inadequate incentives for South African doctors to work in rural areas.  Some doctors employed by State health were given a territorial allowance which was an attempt to compensate them for working in these areas.  Although it sounded reasonable one had to bear in mind the realities of living and working in a rural area.  These doctors had no housing subsidy like colleagues in public sector jobs in urban places.  There were many inconveniences and expenses associated with living in very remote rural areas including bad roads, having to travel far to do shopping, repairs or anything like that.  Unreliable telephones or no telephones for months on end.  Erratic electricity and water supplies. Schooling was problematic for those with children.  There was no access to medical libraries for continuing medical education.\n One could continue this list which serves to illustrate that life in a rural hospital was awkward or inconvenient for people. While a few adventurous doctors accepted the challenge of living in the bush and tried to live as positively and enterprisingly as they could, for most doctors these situational factors were serious disincentives to working in rural areas.  \n The Department of Health could have provided financial incentives to doctors to recruit them to rural areas.  Many young doctors have loans to pay off and travel to other countries specifically to earn more money to pay their debts.  \n The Department of Health could also have thought of other creative alternatives, for example a paid sabbatical leave for any doctor who worked for a fixed period of time under a contract.  There was such a system available to British doctors employed in a rather strange way, but no one else.\n Rural medicine is uniquely stressful and the idea of paid long leave after a number of years of service would be a real encouragement to doctors to commit themselves for longer periods.",

            "The KwaZulu Pledge",
            ".\n There were to our knowledge no Zulu doctors working in rural hospitals in KwaZulu between 1986 and 1994.  The University of Natal have been graduating Zulu doctors for about 40 years, so how did the situation come about?  The reasons are complex but one important one I've singled out was the KwaZulu Pledge.  This is a law requiring all KwaZulu public servants to sign an oath of allegiance to the KwaZulu government and its leaders. If a person refused to sign the pledge they could not be employed as a public servant in KwaZulu. We ourselves were not required to sign it as we are employed in State health posts.  This pledge deters Zulu doctors from working in rural areas.\nThe lack of academic support for rural medicine.\n Doctors need training, professional support in the field of ongoing continuing medical education in order to be motivated to do a good job and to provide a good quality of service.  The University of Natal showed very little interest in rural medicine.  While there may have been political and situational reasons for failing to provide academic support for rural health were they truly adequate excuses for neglecting to support the doctors and health service that attempted to provide health care for a few million under-served poor and marginalised rural South Africans?   We do not believe the excuses were adequate.\n It is our firm recommendation that specific attention and resources be given to rural health and rural medicine by the country's medical academic institutions, a kind of affirmative action towards rural areas without which the situation is likely to remain unchanged in the future.\nVery few South African doctors and the difficulty of registering foreign doctors.\n There are very few South African doctors who are willing to work in rural hospitals.  Many were leaving the country for personal as well as political reasons.  These included the problem of conscription for White male doctors, the general level of violence and unrest in the country and perceived unsatisfactory working conditions.\n In contrast to this was the situation of doctors from other countries wanting to work in South Africa, often specifically in rural areas. It is not an exaggeration to say that in the majority of rural hospitals, foreign doctors were the life-blood of the service. Without them there would have been no service.  The problem was that the procedure for registration was difficult and got worse from the mid-1980's.  We were very frustrated by corresponding with interested doctors from countries with a good standard of medical training to see them lose interest because of the problem of registering with the South African Medical and Dental Council. The burden of an understaffed health service which could have been lightened continued. Ultimately he suffered with the disadvantaged rural communities.",

            "The consequence of lack of doctors",
            ".\n If doctors left and there was no one to replace them it created enormous stress and overwork for those who remained.  No one wanted to go and work in a hospital that was badly staffed because they knew it would be very stressful, so more left and a vicious cycle developed.  Some hospitals were down to one or two doctors for two or three hundred bed hospitals and there were some hospitals that had no doctors for a few years.\n The next part looks at doctors who do not respect the human rights of their patients. This is what the TRC apparently most wanted to hear about.  There were a number of GP's in the area who provided curative health care on a private basis.  On a few occasions I did locums for them and was thus able to experience aspects of their practice which undermined the dignity of the people who were unethical in some way. \n Firstly separate facilities.    \n Black patients were treated differently to White patients. Doctors' surgeries were divided up and had separate waiting areas as well as consulting areas. Whites had a waiting room which was comfortable while the Black patients waiting room was uncomfortable and inadequate.  It might have just been a verandah or just sitting outside on hard benches or on the ground.  \n The consulting areas were also different. The White patients were seen in a room where there is privacy, a desk where the doctor sat, an examination couch and curtains around the bed for the patient to undress with dignity.  \n The Black patients were examined in a room which had been divided up with partitions to create three of four kinds of stalls which is a narrow space which scarcely fit an examination couch.  The doctor stood and hurried from one stall to the other and they lined the patients up.  There was no privacy as the partitions did not prevent patients from hearing what the doctors said to others.  There was no linen on the couches.  It was very uncomfortable. The situation was undignified and created a feeling of a depersonalised production line.\nThe abuse of the jova(?)\nBlack patients were treated differently to White patients.  They paid a standard fee for which they got a consultation and medication as part of a package deal. Medication had to include an injection, the Zulu word for which is the jova as well as two or three different kinds of pills or medication in syrup form.  When doing a locum I was told in no uncertain terms that this practice was non-negotiable.  Every patient must have a jova.  When I asked what to give a baby withe diarrhoea, which is a common primary health care problem which requires a detailed enquiry into feeding practices, use of enemas and then advice about oral rehydration but no medication. The doctor said, oh just give them anything, penicillin, streptomycin, gentomycin, sterile water, vitamin E, anything you like but just make sure they get the jova.\n The practice was defended on the grounds that the patients demanded it and were not satisfied with the consultation if they did not get it as well as a few other pills. Clearly the GP's felt they would lose patients if they did not continue this well established practice.  For medical and ethical reasons this is a very problematic thing.  I won't go into it now but if people want to know at questions... \n I was told stories by nurses about GP's re-using needles until they were blunt. This was something they had observed while attending GP's as patients.  This practice is purely unethical and dangerous and spreads infections such as hepatitis B and HIV.\nFailure to provide primary health care.\n GP's are in an excellent position to provide primary health care, the minimum being to give routine immunisation to children.  They do not do it.  This results many missed opportunities.  I would add that I know that none of these circumstances are any different now to the period under discussion.\n The third point was police violence.\n We were expected to do medical examinations to determine if minors were medically fit to be whipped by the police. This was degrading and humiliating for all concerned. We saw patients who had been assaulted or tortured by the police.  I won't talk about this because people have talked about that a lot.",

            "is something I want to talk about because I feel like nothing has been said about it in these health hearings.\n Disabled people have very difficult lives in any situation but particularly so in rural areas.  Wheelchairs cannot move on soft sand and life is often intolerable for people with serious disabilities.  I'd like to tell you just about one patient of ours, a Mr Frans Pimbi.  He became quadriplegic after an accident in 1979.  He had no movement in his legs and only a little in his arms.  He was totally dependent on his mother for everything and he was confined to a wheelchair.  They lived in a home comprised of sticks and mud huts about 10km from the hospital and he received a disability grant of R242 every second month.  He was subject to terrible urinary infections and bed sores which were difficult to treat because of the scarcity of clean water and the distance from the hospital.  \n In other situations Frans could have expected to access resources and assistance to cope with his condition but because he was Black and because he lived in a rural area, he suffered far more than others with similar disabilities and he died far sooner.\n I present Frans's story as an example because his life and subsequent death of TB in 1990 was an expression of the abominable effects of the whole system on an individual. That he lived with such dignity and inner strength, despite the cruelty of his situation was a source of great inspiration to us and testimony to the power of his faith in God.\n As District Surgeons we were obliged to assess applicants for disability grants, a system that was fraught with difficulties.  Many who were clearly eligible, or had serious disability, had endless bureaucratic problems.  The system was very inefficient, bureaucratic, waste of the time of all concerned and in many, many cases corrupt.  People whose lives were filled with physical suffering were given very little real support.\n The last point is TB repatriation from the mines.\n In the course of our work we frequently came across TB sufferers who have laid off work at the mines because of their illness despite an official policy to the contrary. They were paid out a lump sum and discarded by the employment agency TEBA  because they were unfit to work and ended up in our TB wards with their lives barely intact.\n In conclusion, we have highlighted a number of situations in which we felt that the Medical Profession and those responsible for the provision of health services abused the human rights of rural communities and individuals through the neglect of their duties towards them. We know that people died prematurely and suffered immeasurably in obscure corners of rural South Africa as a result of these sins of omission. Their suffering was no less significant for it's hidden and undramatic nature.  \n It is our hope that by sharing these experiences and raising the issues that the health of rural people and communities in this country would be given the attention it deserves in  the New South Africa.  It many ways it is an indicator of the extent to which the new government succeeds in its task.",

I've spent the last six months abbreviating thousands of cases with evidence into hundreds, into dozens and the 60-minute presentation has been cut down - I am pleased I've spoken before it's been cut down to ten minutes.\n I was struck by the similarity between my experiences and those of David Klatzow yesterday.  Having been subjected to cross-examination and often very, very cross-examination as an expert witness for up to three and a half weeks in human rights cases, I know what he meant about the appearance of confabulated and fake expert evidence which never ever, ever received critical attention of the courts.  I think what we often experienced were not simply miscarriages of justice, they were full legal abortions of justice.  \n I would also like to support what Francis Ames said yesterday about how some of us were harassed and discredited for speaking the truth.  We need and deserve and look to you ladies and gentlemen for proper and official rehabilitation.\n The extent to which racism and the disregard of the human rights dominated South African health care is hard to believe, even to those of us who lived through it and struggled against it. As an illustrative example, when I was the medical director of the Highway Hospice in Durban, which I think was the first non-racial hospice in South Africa based in what was classified as a White area though servicing all areas we could reach.  We insisted on providing non-discriminatory health care to anyone who qualified by the simple criterion as being a dying patient. And one day I received a telephone call from a senior government health official, saying, \n\"Professors we have received complaints about your Hospice.  It is in a White area and they tell me that you are allowing Black people to live there, and this will have to stop\".\nSwallowing my anger and thinking quickly I said to him, \n\"Sir, you are seriously mistaken, this is a hospice and palliative care programme and devoted to preserving the dignity of our patients and reducing their suffering.  I'm allowing Black people to die in this hospice and can you please tell me which law specifies where they are allowed to die?\"\n There was a long silence and much rustling of paper and he finally admitted very grumpily that he could not think of any regulation that specifically forbade that and we continued caring for all who needed our help, and we didn't hear from him again.\n I think one reason I quote that sort of example is I think it is under-appreciated how much might have been achieved, perhaps in a succession of similar small victories, had anybody bothered to try to say \"no\" more often than most of our colleagues ever did.  \n It had been noted in all significant other historical examples of oppression, the indifference of the bystanders is critical for the success of the aggressors. It is deeply unwholesome that in the South African situation the bystanders continue in many cases and we saw some illustrations yesterday afternoon to deny, develop amnesia and ignore the essential role they played in that past process.  This is a political ointment but one that the health care sector should not accept.  It's not anyone's task to comfort the afflicted, it is sometimes necessary for us to afflict the comfortable.  \n There has been far too little genuine debate about the nature of social healing and what surely promotes it. Truth is one essential component of the needed social antiseptic which could cleanse the social fabric of the systematised habits of disregards for human rights, but it needs to be an examined truth, it needs to be considered, thought about, debated and digested and metabolised by individuals and by society.  Failure to comprehend recent suffering is too often, in the studies I have made received, the seed of future suffering.  \n Soon after my return to South Africa I began to be consulted about the problems of political violence and of political detainees.  Perhaps our first major case was the case of the detainee Surish Surnee(?) in 1985, in which we succeeded in gaining his release, as I think was entirely appropriate, on health grounds, but from that date on I and those of my colleagues who assisted in that case received consistent severe harassment, both within the university and outside it, including death threats and death attempts. Some of us were dissuaded from such work by these experiences and some of us perhaps being more congenitally stubborn continued. Cases I worked on include State v Tsele and Others in Newcastle and Utrecht which occupied much of my time over three years. The State v Tuka and Others in the last of the major Delmas trials, the matter of my colleague who has joined us today and yesterday, Ebrahim Masinya, an ANC official who was kidnapped from Swaziland and very severely treated in captivity, and the lengthy Potgietersrust inquest into the death of Donald Madisha from 1990 on in which incontrovertible evidence of gross irregularities and improprieties in this very highly suspicious death of a detainee, perhaps one of the last of the detainees to die in detention even after 1990, was so carefully and skilfully ignored by a magistrate sitting with a professor of forensic medicine as an assessor.\n There are many examples but I have, at your request, winnowed those down to a few that specifically most clearly illustrate the problems, but we do appeal, and I've discussed this with many of my colleagues from more northerly regions, appeal to you very distinctly to enable at least a further hearing at which more of these examples of which there are so many, can be examined properly because the process you have begun is one that cannot be curtailed, and if it is, the fact that you have done it, may be used by many others as an excuse not to take it further and the process has to be taken further.  \n We need to recognise the roles of those that were played by, not only by those who actively assisted in the abuses that occurred, but also the essential role played by those who so deliberately and skilfully ignored what was going on.\n Bystanders in the health sector were not as they claimed being neutral in a conflict with regard to item issues involving torture and repression.  Doing nothing or behaving as if nothing untoward was happening is not neutral.  It is highly effective and often essential assistance to the primary perpetrators and renders one a secondary perpetrator.  No doctor expects to be neutral in dealing with cancer or aids and we should not consider our task or our role any different in dealing with torture and repression which are merely cancers and infections of freedom.  \n When doctors, as so many whom I am naming to the Commission in my more detailed submissions, when doctors and other experts were actively involved in helping to disguise the evidence of abuses that occurred, they were actively assisting in the survival of evil as much as if they had allied themselves with the virus.  \n It is also important to realise that none of the major institutions, including the Medical and Dental Council, ever took action including cases I didn't mention in their submission yesterday, as in the Soni case where one of the psychiatrists who had examined him announced in his affidavit, both that he had advised this man to end the suffering which was essentially self-imposed because all he needed to do was to tell the Security Police what they wanted, and of course he would then be released.  Who actually, I am told by the detainee himself, was advised by the psychiatrist of the details of the witness protection programme that he might have access to then and who, in his affidavit stated that he would advise the interrogators to finish their work by whatever means they saw fit as soon as possible.  We, myself and other colleagues at the University of Natal at that time reported this case with documentary evidence to the Medical and Dental Council.  They sat on it for over 18 months.  They came up with ridiculous delays like writing back to us to ask if this was actually a complaint and we couldn't imagine what else it might have seemed like to anybody, and eventually decided that there was absolutely no case to take beyond even the preliminary investigation phase.\n Let me give some other brief examples.  A doctor from a department of psychiatry at a major university took part in the treatment of a political detainee suffering from PTSD following his interrogation in solitary confinement, a patient who had been referred to him by the prison doctors and by a colleague at another medical school, without revealing his intentions to his patient and without obtaining the patient's consent, the doctor then worked very closely with the State prosecutor advising him, even in court, whispering into his ear during the prosecution of his patient in a case in which the State was challenging the diagnosis and the necessary management of that patient, yet without himself testifying, which enabled him to do this without having to stand cross-examination about his extraordinary contact.\n Another psychiatrist, who worked very extensively with the Security Police, and there were some who boasted of their earnings, and I suggest it would be very profitable and fruitful for the Commission to enquire with the Department of Justice and other relevant bodies about the amounts that were paid to certain individuals, I'd be very interested to know on the principle of Faust's experience what the cost of a doctor's soul is.  I'd like you to find out how much some of these people were paid and for how long. If what they boasted to us are true, it is astonishing.  \n Another psychiatrist who worked very extensively with the Security Police provided opposing evidence uniquely and consistently in case after case where there was clear evidence of damage to and abuse of political detainees.  In various trials he asserted in his testimony to a number of very highly eccentric and idiosyncratic opinions entirely unrelated to international expert and professional consensus, but all characterised by absolutely perfect convenience to the needs of the State's defence of the Security Forces against the complaints of detainees and prisoners. \n Amongst his opinions he testified under oath, for example, that at interrogation conducted with the subject kept standing for up to 10 to 14 hours at a stretch without rest, would not be highly stressful, and he stood there lounging against the witness box and remarked impertinently that he had been standing for some time answering the questions of the defence counsel and he felt fine.  \n He testified that PTSD can never be diagnosed without absolute external, independent, irrefutable and objective proof of the facts and nature of the trauma, which would not only invalidate almost every example of the diagnoses certainly made on earth in the last 20 or so years since the diagnosis exist, but would mean that in the case as was needed in this case of political detainees, in the case of rape victims and so on, the diagnosis could never be made without the active approval, consent and assistance of the rapist and the torturer. \n He testified that it was impossible for the defence psychiatrist, in this case myself, to have conceivably diagnosed PTSD after examining a patient for a mere total of 12 hours and without a 30 days period of in-hospital investigation and observation including a host of investigations, everyone of which have been shown by international research to be irrelevant in making that diagnosis.  \n On the other hand he was able with absolute confidence, absoluut beslis to testify that he could authoritatively diagnose that this man suffered from absolutely no psychiatric condition whatsoever, actually one of the more difficult diagnoses to make reliably, on the basis of not having examined the man, having deliberately avoided even hearing the man testify in court, but having watched from across the court room, the man's face while the man listened to my testimony.  On that basis, he of course, without the 30 days observation, not even the 12 hours, could diagnose that there was nothing wrong with the man.\n There's much evidence that this man, for example, among others worked closely together with the Security Police.  On one occasion in a break in the court case, I flew from Natal to the Cape to talk to a group of doctors and on the first day back in court this witness, who had a habit of having tea with the magistrate in the absence of the members of the defence team, strolled up to me and said, well what was the weather like in the Cape over the weekend, in order to let me know that I was under surveillance.  He had full access to the results of that surveillance. \n In the case of another political prisoner kidnapped in another country and brought to South Africa under duress, the man developed very severe psychiatric symptoms after interrogation and torture.  A prison doctor wisely decided to arrange to transfer his patient to the psychiatric department of the local university hospital for observation and expert treatment, but his clinical decision, and we can prove this from affidavits and from court transcripts, was intercepted and countermanded by a more senior district surgeon who had never examined the patient and later showed spectacularly little knowledge of the man, but admitted under oath that he had discussed the case with a senior security police official and decided, and I quote,\n\"....in collaboration with this police official to instead transfer the ill man not to a university hospital for observation and treatment but to another solitary confinement cell, simply in a different city where he would have access to a forensic psychiatric specialist who worked exclusively with the Security Police in almost every case, who no longer treated patients but simply produced reports that were used in court cases and as in this case was used to oppose an application for the release of the patient\".\n There's another similar doctor whose diagnosis, so far as I can discover, in every single case of every detainee and torture victim he saw, was an adjustment disorder. The most trivial diagnosis he could give in such circumstances, when he was not for some reason able to diagnose nothing, his preferred diagnosis.   \n In this case this psychiatric forensic specialist saw the man who had been tortured and who described having been kidnapped and having been tortured, impatiently made a note in his handwritten notes of the consultation, that the patient he said rather waspishly was giving, \"many irrelevant details\".\n A professor of forensic medicine and author of a standard text book in the topic was appointed as the assessor in an inquest into the sudden and deeply suspicious death of a political prisoner. Amongst the evidence given to the court which he never challenged or questioned in any way and which he allowed the magistrate to accept without question, and to reach a verdict in which no one was found in any way responsible for the death, include such fascinating facts as the fact the patient had received a very substantial intravenous injection of valium some 12 hours before he was found dead of asphyxia, yet no trace of any drug had been found in his blood at death and valium should have been found detectable for weeks afterwards.  \n The police surgeon had claimed to have ascertained on examining the dead man that he had been dead for exactly 20 minutes, a figure that was actually very important in order to exonerate certain of the police who were believed by the family to be responsible for the death.\n Now I keep as good a touch as I can with modern developments in forensic science and I know that there is no way known to human science to determine the time since death as accurately as to within 20 minutes, particularly within the first hour or so of death.  We speculated in the defence team as to what miraculous scientific tool he may have used to try to achieve this and eventually he admitted under cross-examination that the brilliant tactic he had used was to lay his hand against the forehead of the dead man and guess.  But this fact, this testimony, this expert testimony was accepted without challenge by the professor of forensic medicine and by the court.\n In the same case we had evidence from a police surgeon, a very old man who testified that he was responsible for the \"care\" of all the security detainees within a substantial area in the Northern Provinces.  He had noted in the medical records that were kept in the Section 29 File and had provided in his affidavit a statement that this detainee had never had any complaints and had received no treatment.  When in an enquiry, because his handwriting was even more disgusting than mine and completely illegible, he suddenly produced to our amazement, a duplicate set of notes, the clinical equivalent of double bookkeeping for the same patient but which he kept in his personal and private files, which revealed that the man had had many health complaints, had been treated by him on a number of occasions, and he had diagnosed and probably genuine and some rather strange diagnoses such as chronic appendicitis in the same patient.   A local district surgeon called to the man on the night before his death found him acutely disturbed and shouting that \"they\" were going to kill him and his family.  Something which we know well and you on the Commission know especially well, often did happen, at least not necessarily an indication of paranoia.  \n According to his sworn statement he diagnosed immediately schizophrenia, an impossible diagnosis to make competently under those circumstances and treated the man with intravenous valium which is not even the treatment for schizophrenia.\n  After reading my preliminary...(intervention).",

            "I would be sad if the Commission was as adept at silencing me as the State has proved to be earlier. I must finish that example for example, otherwise what I've already said would make no sense.\n After reading my preliminary expert report to this effect, and after meeting with a specialist psychiatrist called by the State to assist, a former head of psychiatry at 1 Military Hospital, he began his oral testimony by asserting that despite what he had said in his affidavit made the day after death, he actually hadn't diagnosed schizophrenia as he had said but had actually diagnosed a brief reactive psychosis, a very highly convenient fiction but a very rare diagnosis and not applicable in that case.   The same doctor testified that he had conducted a comprehensive and competent full physical examination of the patient in a small and dark cell in which there were three policemen  who failed somehow to see this occur and with the patient remaining standing and fully clothed throughout the procedure.\n Leaving out many other examples let me move to a close, but I repeat and reiterate my call that we cannot abbreviate the professional discussion of these issues, and there is, as far as I can see no other forum in which this will be allowed or enabled to occur.\n There will be those who complain that our efforts in this section of the TRC's work may damage the national and international reputation of the medical and other health science professions in South Africa and this complaint is of course mischievously false.  The reputation of these professions was massively damaged by the active misconduct of relatively few professionals and the passive acquiesence of a far larger proportion.\n Facing what actually happened and learning from these experiences and striving to prevent their recurrence, and ensuring appropriate professional discipline for those whose conduct was professionally unacceptable is the only way in which our professions can deserve to regain a good reputation.  \n There is no statute of limitation on unprofessional and ethical conduct and no one may be given amnesty for such conduct.  \n If we wish to become genuinely and comprehensively healing professions again, we owe it to the victims, and I occupy the uncomfortable position of being expert and victim, to continue and complete this process of examination, comprehension, reparation and prevention.  These are necessary parts of the healing process and healing does not occur just because it is declared to be desirable.\n I'd like to close with a quote from Albert Kamu(?) who helped towards defining our admission, using the metaphor of a pestilence, a plague to reflect the encounter with oppression, and he wrote eloquently about how a doctor felt compelled to join in a struggle against the plague. The doctor, he wrote did so,\n\"So that he should not be one of those who hold their piece but should bear witness in favour of these plague-stricken people, so that some memorial of the injustice and outrage done to them might endure, and to state quite simply that what we had learned in the time of that pestilence, that there are more things to admire in men than to despise. He knew that the fate he had to tell could not be one of the final victory, if could only be the record of what had had to be done and what assuredly would have to be done again by all who, while unable to be saints, but refusing to bow down to pestilence, still strive their utmost to be healers.\"\n Preparing for this testimony I find has stirred up, to a degree to a degree I didn't expect, my own symptoms, but I think, I pray that like the victims I work with, that just as we try every night as I am cross-examined in my sleep, not to allow the wicked people to triumph in the land of our dreams, as they did triumph in the land of our birth.  \n Thank you.",

            "I'll keep my presentation brief so that I may be able to respond more fully to questions that may be of more interest.\n This is the submission of the Psychological Society of South Africa and deals with professional psychology associations responsibility regarding human rights. I'll give a brief history as I've outlined in the submission and then go on to the testimony. \n The first Psychology Association was established in 1948 with a membership of 34.  In 1962 a new association was established, the Psychological Institute of the Republic of South and it was established because the existing body had eventually, after much to-ing an fro-ing had decided to admit Black members to the society.  This new Society was exclusively for Whites and got adulatory responses from people in government and other White institutions in the country.\n Psychology, from its earliest times, has been a very active force within the racism debate and for example three professors of psychology felt so strongly about keeping Blacks out of the first organisation that they arranged a meeting with the Prime Minister to persuade him to extend the powers of the Group Areas Act so that meetings where Blacks and Whites would confer together would be banned.   One of the psychologists le Grange, which included van der Merwe and du Toit fron Stellenbosch University became the first president of PsySSA. \n The two organisations that served professional psychology merged in 1983 to form the Psychological Association of South Africa and I would like this gathering to note that the racist organisation, PsySAA, did not dissolve and rejoin the other one, but it was - both organisations dissolved as if both had equal access to this joining.\n PsySAA dissolved in 1994 to form the current Association mainly because it was felt that this organisation still was very much wedded to the more conservative interests of psychology and that the previous organisation PsySSA in fact played the major role in this new organisation.   There were also protests from different groupings of psychologists against the existence of this organisation.  \n Some other organisations that served psychology were the Student Counselling Organisation in South Africa, SSCSA, established in 1978 at a meeting of delegates from 15 universities and this organisation continues to represent counsellors at tertiary educational institutions in South Africa. \n This organisation really did hardly anything to promote human rights or to look at racism or issues of oppression at universities or other tertiary institutions, and a survey of the papers of their conferences between 1978 and 1985 found that not one paper challenged the status quo, analysed the influence of apartheid on counselling or dealt with racism. This organisation in fact had a very cosy relationship with the South African Defence Force at that time, giving donations and promoting visits to the boys on the border.\n A separate organisation, OASSSA, who will present something later on so I won't talk much about them was established in 1985, including psychologists and other social service workers and endeavoured to provide services to communities and individuals who would not usually have access to such services.  \n In 1988(?) a grouping of psychologists were formed called the Psychology and Apartheid Committee and this grouping specifically focused on issues of oppression and Black empowerment within psychology, because up to that time very few Blacks qualified as psychologists due to the active work by White psychologists to keep Blacks out of this training.   \n I'll now go on to look at what kind of contribution to a human rights culture psychology made. \n It is my opinion that psychology did little to advance human rights in South Africa, and in fact those who did try to advance such human rights were usually subject to censure from main stream psychology. The (...indistinct) of human rights was always considered to be bringing politics into psychology, it was something to be avoided at all costs.  What was curious about this position was that rightwing activism, active political work in psychology was not considered as politicising psychology.\n I'd like to use a few examples to illustrate that psychology has always been involved with politics. As early as the late 1920's three psychologists, E G Malherbe, R W Wilcox and H F Verwoerd advocated job reservation and legislation to inflict severe penalties on sexual intercourse between the races after concluding their research on the poor White problem, psychologists like M L Fick and J van Rensburg, among others, who propagated ideas of Black intellectual inferiority Psychology's general neglect of the issues of oppression, racism and socio-political problems in its teaching, training and research.\n I will also read a quote from the current president of PsySSA who had the following experiences as a health psychologist and health practitioner while a political prison and an aspirant psychologist. This is his quote that he faxed to me.\n\"Health practitioners in the service of the State, in my experience, were generally under the thumb of the security apparatus in the bad old days. Even when it came to practitioners in hospitals like Groote Schuur, they tended to adopt an attitude that indicated their subservience to the requirements of the Security Police or the Prison Administration.  Indeed many of them, including specialists, used by the Prison Department would rather gather their information from warders or jailers than myself.  I often wondered who the actual patient was. Like the experience of being a Black servant in a racist master's household, I, the patient, became invisible.  With psychologists from General Roux to those he appointed to Robben Island, they were clearly uninterested in the issues presented by the inmates. Theirs was to act as an information gathering conduit for their bosses.  The psychologist who visited me and my fellow inmates from the PsySSA BPC Trail at Victor Verster Prison one month before my release in November '82 rarely interrogated us, or at least tried to do so.  His role was to ferret out exactly what we would do on our release.  He actually told me that if I became a psychologist I would be dangerous to the State because the insights I could bring to political organisations that I would be able to decide who would be an asset and who a liability to the struggle while sifting out agents.\n This theme followed me to Wits University selection for the MA in clinical psychology where I was subjected to interviews, even by progressive psychologists, about whether I could be let loose on the public.  Sterkfontein would not have me as an intern because Head Office decided that I should not put my foot into a State facility. Tara Hospital had to then decide if I was suitable for them.  At UCT they also felt eventually that we are taking a chance on you.  \n Some of these attitudes still prevail when selecting Black candidates despite White protestations to the contrary playing gate-keeper to the Profession, a situation of the problem perpetuating itself\". \nThis is a statement by Dr Saths-Cooper.\n Other experiences that also bear this out are the experience of Breyten Beytenbach as detailed in his book the Confession of an Albino Terrorist.  He give his contact as follows:\n\"The prison psychologist...\"\nor the way he called them, \"spychologist\".\nHe describes his meeting with what he called,\n\"....the big boss of the prison shrinks.  He was short fat balding fanatic wearing glasses.  He was the head of the special wing for psychopathic prisoners in Zonderwater Prison. I talked to people who have been through there they had no privileges at all.\"\n He goes on to account a conversation with a Dr Roux which Dr Roux later denied had taken place. Dr Roux was the head of the Prison Service and was a psychologist and obviously determined a lot of the psychological standards within prisons and Breytenbach recounts that during one of his conversations with Dr Roux the following took place:\n\"He gave me a spine-chilling but quite coherent exposure of his own political beliefs. I should not say beliefs, maybe this was more in the way of reactions. He was curiously needing to justify and defend his position, although I had not said a word. It came down to the old line of we are living in a dramatic period of exceptional importance, having to face in combat extraordinary challenges.  We cannot afford to be manacled by a concept such as democracy or even decency, we, meaning them, need to be strong to go all out in a total answer to the total onslaught concept. Our fate is fatal, rather suicide in the desert than anarchy in apocalypse.\"\n He gives another quote in his book of the resident psychologist of Pretoria Central Prison, Colonel van Alwaard(?)\n\"He had me go through the gamut of outdated tests, the rash of blots and blobs, squiggles and various IQ examinations.  Naturally I was never informed about any of his deductions.  I was the guinea pig. These perverted practitioners of the spurious science of psychology do not have as their first priority to help the prisoner who may need it, they are the lackeys of the system.  Their task very clearly is to be the psychological component of the general strategy of unbalancing and disorientating the political prisoner.\"\n Even in the SADF there were projects linked with psychology that have been presented to a secret meeting of this body.\n This brings to the end the formal submission.  Professor Foster was supposed to continue at this point but I don't know whether he is here yet or if he's not arrived. We hope to include a great deal more detail in our final report and we also await other reports from different groupings that we think might elucidate matters in regard to the Human Rights culture.

            "Okay, what occurred at this meeting was that there was a reluctance on the part of Dr Verwoerd to in fact extend this legislation and he felt that there were more natural means of excluding Blacks than would be served by expanding this legislation, which as you would know, really was quite wide already. What he did do then though was to try to force all professional associations to keep their proceedings separate by race on the pain of having whatever subsidies they might gain from the government be kept back should they not do this.\n Most of the professions did not adhere to this and the State then backed down on that and allowed professions to some degree to manage their own affairs in this regard. So Dr Verwoerd did not see to the request at that time to extend that legislation. \n But to your previous comments I just would like to add that during this period the person who was regarded as the exemplar of psychology and the doyen of South African psychologists was somebody called Dr Vischeville(?) who still is a major icon today in South African psychology and he was really the main person responsible for keeping out Blacks initially.  And the curious fact about South African psychology is that the progressive or those who were regarded as progressive White psychologists probably did as much as the rightwing ones to keep Blacks out of the profession.  So he was one of the main activists trying to keep people out and who Ms Naidoo reported to me was the main actor in her humiliation, trying to qualify to be in this Association.\n One should also remember that to the rightwing psychologist it seemed pretty obvious that this was really a White society because their main honourary member was Dr Verwoerd himself who obviously resigned after they admitted the first Black psychologist after these years of debates and votes on the matter.",

The reason why I'm asking that it's mainly because really what we deal within our databases like the techniques of this profession in particular, you know, psychological assessments and some of the strategies that were used in getting information out of people like torture, as given by the example which is cited by you from Dr Saths-Cooper, were based on the theories of psychology, so I see now there's a new name.

There are some efforts, there is a committee that deals with equity and redress but I'll really have to be frank and say that I believe that within the organisation the majority of membership could still be regarded as conservative.  I think that this would be reflected in the content of what we teach in psychology and that there is really far too little focus on the larger social problems that we need to address, the problems of racism and the problems of oppression.  And I think the slowness of change is really facilitated by the lack of visibility and scrutiny and that this Commission is really nationally one of the main instruments of visibility in the country, and to me personally has succeeded beyond my wildest dreams, but I think also possibly beyond the wildest nightmares of many other people.  And I hope that even when this Commission ends that some ways would be found to continue this visibility.\n So I'm saying that I think this organisation is struggling with these issues, that I think many people might be feeling that they are doing enough but that a lot more pressure needs to be placed on the organisation to be accountable and to redress the ills of the past.",

Now this theory is perpetuated not only in this country but in many other countries such as the United States and in Europe as well. It's kind of generic in psychology.

But, for example, in terms of the test used to assess intelligence, for many years there were these separate tests and they were just indicated by \"NB\" for \"Nie Blanke\" in front of the designation for the test which were then listed in international directories.  But I think that the NIPR has an even further responsibility in their inhuman tests on miners.  They did much of the research, a lot of it which is still secret and I think that these organisations should still be required to be accountable.\n It's not easy to pin people down because often even while presenting these ideas of Black inferiority there were some people who would then indicate these as examples really of saying, no there is equality but there are contextual conditions for in fact allocating inferiority.  So often the cases weren't clear cut but there certainly is enough information to show that within government and parastatals there was a promotion of this idea.  \n For example Dr Fick had to be restrained from visiting schools and testing all these people because he had a mania for finding these intellectually inferior Black children and there was a notice from one of his departments to not allow him to go into them anymore.",

Needless to say I was never invited back to give a second talk that department.\n The other subtle ways is that within different professional systems it becomes comfortable to only deal professionally with your own kind.  You don't give a thought to how that might reflect in the development of your profession, especially one that largely excluded Blacks and to this day is still around about 90% White.  So not very much credence was given to the efforts that were needed in fact increase Black empowerment within psychology and also Black leadership.  The Black groupings that were formed to promote this position often found censure from both sides, from White leftwing as well as from White rightwing psychologists and I think there was far too little sensitivity and there is too little now even to the need for training Black psychologists and also to promote Black leadership within psychology.",

            "We have of course made a written submission and received some questions yesterday.  We'll leave that for you to ask which questions you want us to address, so I will take out some of the highlights - issues from our submission.\n The first point that I'd like to make is that this is a process initiated by yourselves in response to your request in the Faculty and has now received faculty support and is a form of Faculty submission rather than an individual submission, and the process itself has been a useful one in uncovering a lot of issues in the Faculty and we'll return to that at the end. \n The submission relates to what I think is one of the TRC's mandates, namely to understand the societal conditions that could have allowed violations to take place, violations in which health professionals participated and to make recommendations that will relate to faculties of health sciences, medical schools for the future.\n The submission from Wits is an attempt to record a very summarised and incomplete history of apartheid in medical education, and I again need to emphasise that this is not comprehensive in the time available and we recognise the many omissions and would be happy to supplement this preliminary  submission.  \n It's a record of apartheid in medical education as well as the Faculty's response to that in the belief that this was part of the context which contributed to the values to which our graduates ultimately subscribed.\n We look specifically at the failure of the Faculty to address human rights and ethics as a substantive and formal component of the curriculum prior to approximately 1983 and '84 at which point it was introduced formally, and we make recommendations regarding the incorporation of human rights culture and ethics as a subject in the teaching of health science students for the future.  \n We also highlight the need for academic institutions to guard their autonomy and independence from political authorities so that they can maintain a critical stance with respect to government policy.\n In our submission, as well as in some of the others we've heard yesterday and today a key theme is the tension between what is the responsibility of an institution or an organisation in civil society, and what is the responsibility of government and legislation constraints set externally.  And a lot of what we are talking about in our submission is that tension.  \n The discussions in the Faculty, triggered by this submission as I said, have revealed that there is still an enormous amount of anger and bitterness within the Faculty and in the end we will return to how we think this should be addressed.\n The first set of issues is the relationship between university and government, and what I am going to do is select just a few examples that illustrate this relationship to help understand what the possibilities are for a Faculty and what the constraints are.  \n In most faculties of medicine, and certainly in ours, more than half of our staff are employed by the province, the provincial health authority, not by the university.  They are appointed as joint staff but all of the clinical staff in fact receive their salaries from the Province, their conditions of employment are determined by the Province and discipline is managed by the Province. And so the University has unfortunately limited control and authority over some of these issues.\n One example that illustrates this is the selection of people and particularly the selection of chairs, and we give an example of a professor, a man of colour who Wits, at the selection committee wished to appoint as the head of a clinical department in 1987 and the representative on the selection committee from the Province vetoed this.  The Faculty responded by refusing to make any other appointment, although there was an eligible candidate until in fact the candidate concerned withdrew his application 18 months later, at which point the chair was filled by another candidate. \n In other words, even the appointment of professors in the Faculty are constrained, both sides of course have a veto, the university has a veto as well, over that process.  Promotion of staff within the Faculty was frequently subverted by irrelevant considerations like race and political affiliations and anti-apartheid activism, and the case of Dr Joe Veriavo(?) who has helped us prepare this submission but unfortunately is overseas at this moment could not be here, is a case in point.\n Staff who were active in expressing opposition to the provincial policies were often victimised in other ways besides promotions. One example is of a Faculty member whose sabbatical was terminated at short notice, forcing him to resign because he couldn't get back in time to take up the job, to continue working in the hospital.\n Another example arises out of the protest letters written by doctors at Baragwanath protesting at the conditions of health care at Baragwanath.  The letter was published in the Medical Journal and the Director of Hospital Services called in all of the 101 doctors and asked them to submit a letter of apology to the Medical Journal withdrawing what they had said or else their jobs would be terminated and those who were on short term contracts like interns and registrars who relied on reappointments on an annual basis would not be reappointed.  \n The submission details some of that case which resulted in many of the doctors writing a letter of apology because otherwise they would have lost their jobs.  Others took the province to court and one in fact, was reinstated by the courts as a result of this.  But in the mean time had lost something like a year and a half of clinical time,  experience and employment.\n Some members of the Faculty would have liked the university to take a much stronger line of opposition to this sort of action by the provincial administration. \nPerhaps the Faculty should have refused to fill the posts where it's chosen candidate was blocked. Perhaps senior staff should have resigned in protest against provincial harassment of staff.  To have done so might well have resulted in a post being vacant for a long period of time, as in the case I mentioned, with possible harm to patients and students whose teaching would have been compromised, but perhaps on the other hand it would have precipitated an earlier change in policy and this is obviously one of the issues we have to think about in thinking about the future.\n The issue has come up several times in these hearings of discriminatory employment practices, salaries, benefits etc and again I think it worth highlighting that this is the sole discretion of the province.  In 1969 for example, Black interns were earning roughly half of what White interns earned and African women earned less than African men within the spectrum of doctors.  Black staff did not get travel allowances or thirteenth cheques, they received 25% less leave. These policies obviously created tensions in the Faculty and certainly black staff believed that the university did not bring appropriate pressure to  bear on the authorities to change these discriminatory practises.\n One example which has come to light since making the written submission is of a group of students who attempted to get White staff to sacrifice some of their salaries into a pool which would be used to equalise salaries across staff and this was not supported by White staff at the time. So although the responsibility for salaries and benefits is a provincial one it could certainly be argued, and I think it's true, that the university did not protest as it might have.\n That section then had related to the Department of Health or the Ministry of Health, its provincial arms and the employment practices in the Faculty given that we have joint staff.\n The next section looks at the relationship with the Department of Education and Ministry of Education, another branch of Government, and here we deal firstly with the issue of submissions and the extent to which the  university was prevented from admitting Black students, African students in particular without ministerial consent.  That I think has been covered by some of the other submissions yesterday and I won't repeat that. \n You also saw some graphs of student admissions yesterday and so I won't repeat that.\n After the 1959 Act which closed White universities to Black students we had very few Black students until the mid  '70's when it started increasing again when ministerial consent was granted a little more easily.  In the late '70's the Faculty embarked on an affirmative action programme which I can detail at great length if you're interested in the questions, some of that is covered in the submission.   So the question of submissions was the first question to do with the Ministry of Education.  The second relates to the segregation and training of undergraduate and post graduate students.  This segregation was again largely the result of the segregated hospital facilities where Black students and doctors were not allowed to treat White patients although White doctors were certainly allowed and required to treat Black patients in the Black hospitals.  Again, although primary responsibility must rest with the Province and the Separate Amenities Act which segregated the facilities, it can again, and it has been argued, and I think the Faculty accepts that it did not do as much as it should have and could have in protesting this segregation. The protest only really got under way during the 1980's and eventually became quite substantial with marches, sit-ins, attempts to desegregate the hospitals through just civil disobedience campaigns, but I think that was motivated as much by the Mass Democratic Movement and its attempts and the attempts of organisations like NAMDA to desegregate the facilities, as it was an internally driven process. Up until that point I think it was a process driven by individuals rather than an institutional policy. \n I'm moving on to the next section which deals with the question of admission of patients and care of patients in segregated facilities.  Again we've heard quite a lot about the unequal care available to Black and White patients, the differential resources given to hospitals and clearly a form of discrimination which affected the Faculty since - we have for example, six hospitals in our complex which were segregated by race.\n One of the areas where the Faculty has been criticised for it's policy with respect to this unequal distribution of resources and which I think is valid, is the attitude the Faculty took to the building of the new Johannesburg hospital which was planned in the 1970's, where it was argued or it can be argued, that given the lack of resources in the Black hospitals, the Faculty should have refused to see a new hospital built which would have been for Whites until better facilities had been provided for Soweto and for the community served by Baragwanath and Coronation hospitals. Nevertheless the Faculty enthusiastically embraced the idea of a new academic hospital which was going to be located next to Medical School in central Johannesburg. \n There had always been a few voices protesting the segregation of health facilities as I say, the real campaign gained momentum in the '80's and is described in some of the appendices.  \n One example where the Faculty did exert its power, perhaps belatedly but nevertheless an example of what the Faculty perhaps could have done if it had wished to at an earlier stage related to the episode around the JG Strydom Hospital, which after the Tricameral Parliament was instituted, Health Affairs were transferred and became an Own Affairs activity and JG Strydom, as a White hospital,\nwas transferred to the Own Affairs Department of Health instead of the General Affairs where it had previously been.  All the other academic hospitals remained under General Affairs.  The purpose of transferring JG to Own Affairs was in fact to keep it White because under General Affairs and as an academic hospital that would have been harder to do.     The Faculty responded by withdrawing academic affiliation and association from JG Strydom and it immediately lost almost all its staff and was unable to attract doctors to work there and so it was then transferred back to General Affairs and the Faculty reestablished its affiliation.  \n I think what that episode illustrates is that there were avenues which the Faculty could have exploited better in exerting authority or in challenging the State and its authority and sometimes these were used, very often they were not.\n The Section three of our report gives some examples of protest actions which occurred in the Faculty, I've mentioned the ...(indistinct) doctor's complaints.  It refers to the creation of the Professional and Ethical Standards Committee in 1981 which met frequently, and still meets, throughout the last 16 years.  The issues which that Committee dealt with, I should say that committee was set up as a direct response to the Biko doctors' affair and a perception that the Medical Association and the Medical Council could not be relied upon to protect ethical standards.\n Our Faculty Committee looked at issues such as legal guidelines for health professionals in contact with police while treating unrest patients.  We addressed the issue of clinical independence of doctors in treating prisoners, a legal survey.  We addressed the question of medical students in national service and issues of conscientious objection, doctors ethical and legal responsibilities in times of conflict, guidelines for treating voluntary total fasting, in other words hunger strikes.  These guidelines were created for the use of our faculty members who were treating patients in our hospitals but certainly we evangelised with those guidelines to district surgeons, to MASA, to other doctors and international literature, and a particular feature of that has become accepted by the international medical community, namely that part of one's medical responsibility in treating a detainee is to refuse to allow them to be returned to the conditions of detention. It came to be known as 'Kalk's Refusal' after the author of that article.\n The committee developed a patients bill of rights which we tried to get distributed to the hospitals in which we work, addressed issues of handling of children in detention, the protocol for the medical examination of detainees and issue of confidentiality of medical records which became an issue because the police frequently raided our hospitals and clinics to obtain records of people who had been injured in unrest on the grounds that if they had been injured they must have been guilty and there is an annex describing in some detail the experience of Alexandria Health Centre and in particular, Dr Tim Wilson in protecting patients' records and the Faculty's attempt to support that.\n I won't go into that at length because I think it's easy for this to become a white wash, it's easy to present what was done because those things can be listed and then it looks like the Faculty made a substantial contribution resisting apartheid medicine whereas in many respects, the things that were not done, the sins of omission are not recorded, and in going through archives and in going through minutes of meetings etc, those things do not appear and also tend to be omitted from this.  So I think to maintain balance, I'm not going in this submission through all of those minutes of meetings and issues that were taken up.\n I want to turn finally to what I think is the question of the climate that was created in the faculty and how that contributes to the values that students acquire.  This relates to our recommendations in the last section, and if I may just read this last section then.\nRooted in the colonial racist society of the last 75 years, the Faculty of Medicine colluded with many features of apartheid medicine, protested against others, provided space for individuals to challenge the system, but did little that would have put itself at risk to present a serious challenge to segregated health care; constraints on student selection, restrictions of student access to clinical teaching material and gross human rights violations that were going on all the time.  Yet the Medical Faculty was not a monolithic collaborator.  Aside from individuals in the Faculty frequently including the leadership of the Faculty, the Faculty created committees such as the Committee on Apartheid and the Professional and Ethical Standards Committee which bombarded the authorities, the media and the staff and students with challenges to promote equity and human rights.  In considering what recommendations we could make to avoid health professionals becoming participants in gross human rights violations or even tainted by them through a failure to challenge the perpetrating authorities, our experience points to three aspects.\n1. The teaching of ethics, in other words the sensitising of students to a broad spectrum of ethical issues throughout their careers as undergraduates and postgraduates and providing them with the skills for conceptual moral reasoning, to deal with the many moral issues which confront them in medical practice. Professor Jenkins has managed that process over the last decade and continues to develop that and if time allows and if you're interested we can expand on that a little.\n 2. Creating a respect for everyone's equal human dignity.  We believe that a crucial factor contributing to the role played by many individuals in resisting apartheid was not the substantive content of courses on human ethics or human rights, but the value system they observed around them and imbibed from the Institution and Faculty members.  In one sense this should be easier than it was in the past.  The hospitals are no longer segregated and patients no longer obtain unequal care solely on the basis of race.  But other forms of division replace ethnic hierarchies and health care is certainly neither equal nor equitable. Those patients receiving inferior care are also frequently found in hospitals which are overcrowded, work loads are perhaps heavier than ever and where staff morale is low.  \n All these factors make it harder to demonstrate the concern, sensitivity and equal respect for each patient's dignity. This is the context in which it is easy to start thinking about patients, or some groups of patients as them, different from us. That is when the door is opened to regarding them as not entitled to the same respect, care and rights as us. So it's really the environment that we are saying creates the value system which students imbibe and which they continue to practise afterwards.\n 3. Creating a relationship with the state which protects the university faculty and individual staff and students should they become critical of state actions, and within that, fostering the courage to challenge authority.  We believe that the activism of the 1970's and '80's, the many protests and petitions and public statements by deans and faculty members, the student activism, the tolerance by the university of dissent, even if it did not support those issues, however limited their real impact on policy, however limited all these issues were on policy, nevertheless they all contributed to the maturation of cohorts of health professionals who generally felt concerned about apartheid, about their role in challenging or perpetuating apartheid and about their responsibility for protecting patients' rights against the state. Unlike designing a curriculum or funding a senior post, this liberal milieu cannot be easily guaranteed.  \n There are certainly lessons relating to the need for autonomy of the university from State control, not only in relation to the Department of Education but also the Department of Health. \n The control over appointments is an essential element of academic freedom, as is the freedom to protest and challenge without fear of losing funding and subsidies. \n Furthermore the universities have to ensure they remain tolerant of dissent and encouraging of challenges to any authorities.\n The postscript to our submission discusses the internal process and it's just two paragraphs I'd like to ask Professor Jenkins to report on that.",

            "I have three questions and perhaps the others may have a few others as well.  The first one relates to something that was said yesterday by a young man from KwaZulu Natal who joined the military medical core and the impression was created that young medics, medic in the sense of someone who went as a male nurse, not a medical student, was sent to Black hospitals, Black clinics to practice.  Dr Barker gave a different viewpoint this morning.  I want to ask the question in relation to Alex Clinic.  You've mentioned the long relationship that the University had with Alex Clinic and I know Dr Wilson's here as well, so I welcome him. This question relates to pre-1985 essentially.  What supervision was there of students who went to Alexander Clinic to practice primary health or to learn about primary health care from the University?\n Number two is a situation pertained at Alex Clinic in 1984 and 1985 where almost the same number of babies were born as at the Johannesburg hospital but the environment in which it took place was one of a big room, perhaps the size of many of our bedrooms with a toilet sitting in one corner.  Did the University ever take any note of that in developing the culture that you're talking about?\n Can I just pose all my questions. The second one is to do with your Professional and Ethical Standards Committee. Very important issues were taken up, debated within the University. My question is, how far was that taken beyond, if you like, the walls of the university into discussions with other universities with the SAMDC, with MASA?\n Then the third one relates to what you were saying Professor Jenkins was going to talk about, which is, from your submission it appears you consulted widely and clearly what comes out is that there's a lot of anger, particularly amongst Black professionals within the University.  What is the University going to be doing about that in the future?  Thank you.",

            "Mr Chairman may I answer your third question first then it won't disturb my train of thoughts as much. In the process of soliciting views from the Faculty and past students in preparing for this submission, it became clear as you said, there was a great deal of anger about what these people perceived was an inferior education that they'd reserved at Wits.  This anger is directed against the Health Sciences Faculty as much as it is against the Provincial Authorities, if not more.  This is compounded by their view that the discrimination in health service delivery, in employment practices and in status between White and Black hospitals persists today.  What's changed is a common question that we heard, what's changed in the last seven years?\n There is disappointment that senior members of the Faculty who were seen to have supported apartheid medicine, have not acknowledged the affront called by the Faculty to the dignity of it's Black students and staff. And in my understanding of the philosophy behind the TRC, I have the idea that for the TRC to be effective, to be fully effective, requires that the processes taken into the places where people live and work and interact.  We need in fact a mini-TRC in our institutions, and we believe that this mini- TRC process has already been triggered within our faculty in these last few weeks. \n A great deal of hard work though and creative thinking will undoubtedly be needed if members of the Faculty are to be reconciled with one another.  The privileged members of the Faculty, who were not the victims of apartheid in the teaching hospital settings, must listen to the accounts of their Black colleagues and former students.  They must be reminded of the many ways in which they wittingly or unwittingly collaborated with the system.  They must be prepared to experience and share some of the pain and hurts which their colleagues of colour experienced because of an accident of birth. In such a process we believe we will all undergo changes and experience healing and only then will the Faculty be able to develop into a cohesive structure capable of producing well-trained health care professionals motivated to serve the South African community. \n So we can't really over emphasise the importance of this submission being a beginning of a process which we are committing ourselves to pursue.\n Then do you want me to answer the other question Max?\n The Professional Ethical Standards Committee which has met for 16 years now regularly has done very little, I must confess, as far as relationships with other medical schools are concerned, we heard from Francis Ames yesterday, that they constituted a similar committee at about the same time, namely after our disillusionment with the record of the SAMDC and the MASA, and certainly we've had very little contact with the SAMDC or the MASA in any organised way.  I might say that we have often used the journal of the MASA to bring our viewpoints and publish comments on events of the times and the SAMDC have certainly been included in criticisms from the Committee.  The Registrar has been brought over to the Medical School to participate in the teaching of ethics, certainly, and has been challenged by students in those sessions. \n The supervision of students at Alex, are you happy to deal with that Max, because I have some views but not many?\n Well I just know that during times of crises there as a member of staff with colleagues we would go along there and certainly help supervise in the evenings and at weekends.  Whether they got good supervision from a geneticist or occupational medicine professors who I remember there, I don't know, but certainly we stood alongside them whilst they were confronted by some of the nasty episodes during the mid-fifties.  \n I don't know anything about the deliveries of babies there, perhaps you do Max.",

            "Mr Chairman I would rather leave this question for Dr Wilson if he is going to have any opportunity to present because it would be a more honest reply.  I don't have enough first-hand knowledge.\n I would like to make a different point which may sound like an excuse but I think needs to be borne in mind and that is that the Faculty has no funding to deliver health services, in the same way that we do not employ any doctors and they are all employed by the Province.  All of the resources for delivering health care are provincial resources.  The Faculty is funded by the Department of Education to run some of the laboratories and lecture theatres and employ pre-clinical staff, which makes it very difficult to provide a sustainable health service which is obviously expensive and for which we have no funding.  \n The Alexandra Health Centre was funded by donor funds and the poor facilities you are describing are as much a reflection the inability to raise donor funds as they are a failure of the government to provide any primary care services to a community that it wished to consider illegal and not having a right to settle in a White area.  So that the whole reason for having a so-called university clinic or a clinic there at all was very much to perform a function which the government was refusing to perform for a community that clearly needed health services.  It had to be run out of funds that could be raised for that purpose and these, both the supervision and employment of doctors to supervise students, would all have been inadequate I believe because of the lack of resources.  \n I don't want to though let the Faculty of that time off the hook altogether.  It seems to me again that the contrast you are drawing is between the facilities available at a White Hospital not very far away, and the facilities in a Black Clinic and the faculty perhaps could have done something to get Black patients into the hospital, but the control of hospital services were under superintendents who were not joint appointees, have no accountability to the faculties and who at times called the police to keep our own staff out at times of protest.  So it's hard to know quite how they would have responded if there had been a concerted campaign. But I don't think there was a concerted campaign and so I think your point stands as a criticism of not doing enough to equalise the facilities and resources.",

            "Professors, the question I'm going to ask also relates to the next two submissions. UNDN and the University of Pretoria. There is something particularly problematic about these submissions, and I'm obviously prejudging the next two submissions.  You identify three categories of recommendations.   The teaching of ethics; respect for human dignity and creating a relationship with the State.\n I want to insist there is a fourth category and that is redress.  All White South Africans benefited from the apartheid opportunities.  I have not heard a single person, particularly institutional submissions, address the issue of redress.  I'm a Wits graduate, I knew that I could easily get through Wits because of my credentials, my grades.  Most people, most Black students who were admitted to Wits and UCT for that matter during my time could have made it anywhere.  So you essentially got the cream of the crop.  I consider the issue of missed opportunities as a gross human rights violation.  I have heard apologies all over South Africa about this and that but I've not heard a person saying - yes actually one citizen who is a home-maker who called our office to say I'd like to contribute to the Reparation Fund, but I think it is the responsibility of the academic institutions, not to look at what they do for students who are already admitted, but what to do with students who have missed out from the beginning.  I think you need to be more creative than that. I think you need to make a much more serious commitment because a student who's admitted into the Medical School or Wits in general, will make it.  What do the academic institutions propose to do to reach out to those students from the very beginning who won't even have a chance to be admitted? I hope you understand what I'm trying to say.\n There are very innovative ways of academic institutions who actually start with pre med, when I say pre med, I mean pre university courses in Science and you name it at the beginning.  I think it is a way for universities, all academic institutions to deal with the issue of redress and I sound passionate partly because I am angry at Wits.  I think it is very important to make that serious commitment and not to wait for students to be admitted to Wits.  Create that opportunity at the very bottom of the realm.   And having said that, I'd like to get your opinion on that.",

            "Thank you Chairperson. Maybe before I ask you a question I would just like to read out something from Redress which is an organisation which is based in London and it is thrust is to seek reparation for survivors of Human Rights violations.  Basically they've written a letter and what they've said is that,\n\"I would like to express Redress support and encouragement for this process which we view as extremely timely and important\".\nThose are some of the messages we've got.   Coming to a specific question, yesterday we listened to a young man who is now a highly qualified doctor, Dr Ratamane who was talking about his experiences in one of the so-called open universities, actually not one, two of the so-called open universities. My specific question to you really is that over the years, the world even at the time when there were campaigns for academic boycotts, there were universities who were treated with exception, like Wits University will be one of them, but for the past two days, in our case including what is in our database we are living with this contradiction, almost being schizophrenic getting a progressive message which has got a stance against human rights violations and yet the reality as I've made an example of a person who is today a specialist who went through a difficult time in these institutions, one is left with nothing tangible which gives you a sense of hope that especially institutions of higher learning are lucky, even in future, to be a source of a different way of doing things as against the apartheid grand plan of creating a niche for certain categories of people.  Creating a situation where I would say at a certain point, maybe it became almost impossible for them to empathise. Because neglect of patient care, I still maintain is like a serious deficit where you cannot empathise with a person at a deeper level, who maybe you cannot relate to his whole world view or his creation as a person. So I would like to hear your views on that.",

            "I'm not sure that I've fully understood the second question but I leave that for Professor Jenkins and I'll try to address the first.\n I think I need to say, I suppose firstly to comment on Dr Ramashala's view of what is a gross human rights violation, because I think that I would be concerned that we devalue and demean the awful experiences of many people who have experienced what the law has defined as gross human rights violations, if we put it into the same category as students who have not had an adequate support-system in tertiary education to ensure that we compensate for a bad schooling.  \n For example, I fully agree with the sentiments, I just want to make a distinction between what I think is the focus of our submission and what I think is the focus of the question.  I think the focus of our submission has been around the grosser human rights violations and has been trying to understand what is the culture and the climate that allowed that to happen.\n This sort of question is looking more at the question of how has discrimination - what can we do to redress discrimination and inequality?  I feel just as passionately as you do Dr Ramashala that we need to do this.  It's not in the submission because it didn't seem to me it was the key focus of the submission. \n I will just say very briefly that we don't see this as something that a single faculty should take on because students generally haven't made those kinds of decisions at a very young age, so it's a university activity rather than a faculty activity.  The university identifies and has done for several years, schools in Black areas, townships and in rural areas, provides specific resources to fund laboratories for example to teach science teachers, teach English and Maths teachers, offers opportunities for students to come on to campus on Saturdays and special classes are there so there is a programme in place to try to improve the quality of matriculants so that we can take them without having to make allowances for their marks in such a way that they will not succeed at university because you've taken people who actually are not prepared.  So there is firstly a programme aimed at the schools.\n Secondly, for people who are accepted into our faculty, there is programme called an academic development programme.  In the 1980's we had a bridging programme, an extra year which I think you heard something of yesterday and you heard that some of the people who went through programmes like that at Natal University and also at Wits, found it demeaning because they were regarded as second class students, because they were separated into this special class.  At Wits we abolished it for that reason in the mid '80's.  We restructured it to be a tutorial support programme.  We're now of the view that we again need to reintroduce it and in 1997 we do have for example, 25 students in a bridging year which is run by a part of the University called the College of Science and is a feeder programme for all the science-based faculties, engineering science, medicine.  \n Then there is a tutorial and mentoring programme whereby we link senior students with junior students in order to help them deal with the many social disadvantages which they have coming into a completely foreign environment, accommodation problems, funding problems, transport problems, and so that also has to be addressed, not just the academic issues.\n Nevertheless, in spite of the fact that we think we are attracting, we know we are attracting the cream of the crop and we are providing all the support, it has to be said that we haven't found the formula.  We still have very high drop-out failure rates and it takes some students from disadvantaged educational backgrounds much longer, many more years to complete the degree than others who have come from advantaged backgrounds.  So it's a huge problem for us and it's the main reason that we don't have more Black graduates and we aspire to produce the Black graduates in a similar proportion to those in the population.  We can't do it by admitting people who are not going to pass, that doesn't do them any help and just costs them a lot of money in lost fees.  We need to do it through educational support programmes, but we haven't yet got the answer.  And I think that is one of the areas where there can be very useful collaboration with other institutions to try to find better answers.",

I would suggest that this is a societal problem and not a uniquely medical faculty problem.  Until we have a society which is caring for all members of it and interact at a deep level, we're not going to get to this position where I would say, privileged students will be able to empathise in the way that I think you were getting at.\n I would endorse your sentiment wholeheartedly and say that it's in other institutions and organisations, community activities, churches, those sorts of organisations where these relationships can be forged, where in fact a genuine concern for the patients coming from an underprivileged background will find the caring and hopefully the healing.\n Now I hope that doesn't sound too pious, but I really think that it wasn't part of our brief in preparing this submission.",

            "Commissioners thank you for giving me the opportunity to submit our submission this afternoon. We had some difficulty getting the necessary information from the archives and from input of various members of the Faculty.\n I would like to start with giving a historical background of the Faculty of Medicine being an Afrikaans or traditional White Afrikaans faculty of medicine and university, and its relationship possibly due to the State.\n In 1954 the general accepted pattern of the primary, secondary education in the country was separatenistic in nature.  At the time it was argued that universities should either be fully integrated or fully separated as a continuation of the apartheid pattern of basic education. These arguments were informed by the political ideologies at the time and in turn served to shape the separatenistic nature of the education at the University of Pretoria until the late 1970's when the people started to realise that this nature of education should change.\n The University of Pretoria was subject to the provisions contained in the Statutes of the Republic of South Africa Education University Act No 61 of 1955 of which a clause pertaining to funds reads as follows:\n\"Subsidies to the universities:  The Minister in consultation with the Minister of Finance may out of the monies voted by Parliament, for the purpose, grant subsidies to the university....\",\nand I think I won't go any further.\n The extension of University Education Act No 45 of 1959 affected even greater segregation of university education and it is in my submission.  The University had no option but to conform to the policy regarding the admission of students formulated by the government at that time.  However, in as early as the 1960's the University made available its expertise and lecturers to help institutions serving disadvantaged communities with medical education and in '62 approval was granted for the University to assist in the education of nurses lectures at the University of the North. \n The Minister of Education and Culture, also in response to a University request, approved the cooperation agreement between the universities in the Transvaal and the Department of Hospital Services with the regard to the training of non-white nurses at the Leboni Nursing College at the Kalefong Hospital. \n Throughout the years the Medical Faculty, as put forward by my colleague, Professor Price, as such was strongly linked to the Provincial Health Department who was responsible salaries, medical services and hospital policies.  Legislation dating as far back as '57 aimed at separate university education for Whites and non-Whites which contributed determining the nature of medical faculties at the University of Pretoria.\n The policies within the country at the time limited the admission of non-White undergraduate students to the Faculty. Until the '80's the Faculty was not allowed to register non-White students.  This was among others set out in a letter to the principal of the University dated the 29th of August 1983 in which the Minister of National Education indicated that in order to ensure the optimal use of certain training facilities at universities by Black students, it was determined that no Black person could be registered for studies in medicine, dentistry, paramedical courses, nursing, pharmacology, optometry, agriculture, quantity surveying at the University of Pretoria without prior consent of the Minister of National Education for each case.\n The University was requested to bring it to the attention of all Black persons wishing to obtain admission to these courses and to refer them to various specified institutions, namely the Medical University of South Africa, University of Natal, Zululand, Fort Hare and the University of the North.  Unfortunately Chairperson, this meant that the University was prohibited to register Black undergraduate students in the Faculty of Medicine as referred above.\n In the same letter it was indicated in terms of Section 25(2) of the University Act 1955, there would at that stage be no quota for the registration of any students other than White students at the University of Pretoria.  Non-White postgraduates students, however, were admitted to the faculty of medicine at the University of Pretoria from '83 and mainly as I can recall, worked at our Kalefong Hospital.   In December 1985, the University was informed that the provision prohibiting the registration of students in the faculties mentioned above without approval by the Minister was abolished.  However, it was still compulsory for the registration of such students to fall within the quota prescribed in respect of each university by the Minister.  Since '87 the Faculty has actively worked towards ensuring the admission of Black students, a process which included the changing of perceptions within the faculty, taking firm standpoints against any form of racial discrimination and the Faculty also declared itself in favour of academic freedom and non-discrimination. \n Following this, a policy was issued by the vice-chancellor and principal in 1989, 14th June for the whole University, and I quote,\n\"The University of Pretoria is an autonomous institution that does not discriminate on the basis of race, sex, religion, colour or ethnic origin, aids, physical handicap or in its administration or its education policies, etc\".\n In spite of the above statement, the Faculty had limited success in recruiting, and I must stress this Mr Chairman, we had limited success in recruiting Black students, possibly due to our being an Afrikaans faculty in the University and I must point out, at the present time, we as a university are busy with revision of our language policy. \n And secondly the question of old perception still existed. It possibly explains a time lapse between the first registration of a Black undergraduate student in the Faculty in 1989 and the official approval for the registration of non-white students in 1985.\n In December 1991 the recruitment programme was well underway and in 1992 a total of 54 students from Black communities were enroled at the faculty.  The registration statistics over the period '89 to '96 showed a steady increase in the number of Black students registered at UPM Medical Faculty and in 1996 we had 1437 Black students in our Faculty of Health Sciences.  \n The policies had an input in student admission Chairman. Black students were only admitted in the 1980's as referred to you earlier on.  Since then there has been no discrimination against students who did enrol, and no additional limitations were placed on people. Concern expressed in '92 regarding the admission of Black students who were not as well prepared as their White counterparts to reserved position in the Faculty of Medicine at UP were noted by the Principal and Council.  However it was pointed out that University was obliged to reserve a number of positions in the Faculty of Medicine for Black students in order to render a proper service to the wider community and to ensure that it does not remain an all White faculty.  And I'd like to refer to that as to what we call a category for our disadvantaged students and for the current situation we've got between 50 and 60 places. \n It was further acknowledged that such students had not had the same education opportunities as my colleague already referred to.  It was clear that admission criteria, language and standards should not be used as reasons to deny prospective students access to the faculty.  \n In September '82 the Council decided, and I'd like to focus on non-White postgraduate students to the University, and that's to give assistance and guidance through its lectures on other appropriate ways to students of other races enroled at the postgraduate levels at other universities as requested by them. Such students may, as justified by circumstances have full access to facilities at the University of Pretoria at postgrad level and will be assisted in every possible way to reach the highest possible academic standards.  This assistance and guidance as clearly offered on behalf of the University will ultimately confer or award the degree or diploma.  \n On the 12th of August '83 the admission of non-White doctors as registrars...(intervention)",

Well perhaps I must end by giving you a summary of our possible recommendations. What we think should be done.\n Medical schools could help to prepare health workers to deal with human rights issues in the daily practice, specifically through added values in the medical curriculum such as lectures on human rights, ethics, value systems and responsibilities towards patients and the community.  This  would result in a change in the manner in which procedures are interpreted.\n Secondly, changes should be made to the medical curriculum and I refer to added values which have been incorporated into our new medical curriculum Mr Chairman.  The new medical curriculum of our Faculty which is  integrating the basic and clinical subjects which are problem orientated, community based was recently implemented and will hopefully benefit all the students in our faculty.  This is in line with the new National Health Policy as approved by the new government, specifically  on primary health care, as well as on secondary and tertiary care.\n Thirdly, the idea that all patients have the same value and should be considered as equals, should be upheld at all times.\n Fourthly, institutional mechanisms should be put in place to ensure that the type of human rights abuses that occurred during the apartheid years will never happen again by the following, mainly the declaration of human rights should be applied consistently throughout and monitored by a Faculty committee consistently throughout and monitored by a Faculty Committee comprising staff, students, community members, to oversee adherence to that declaration.  And the University of Pretoria has already instituted a Centre of Human Rights which will help to attain our objectives.\n And perhaps, I would like to mention the question of redress as Dr Ramashala mentioned, and that is that our University as a whole is actively involved with a redressing programme, trying to help the people on primary and secondary school level and prepare them for tertiary education in the years to come.  \n Thank you Mr Chairman.",

The Medical School owes its existence to the farsighted vision of two medical missionaries namely Dr McCord(?) and Dr Helen Taylor,  who realised that the burgeoning population of the Greater Durban area required increasing health services.  It was intended to serve the Black, primarily African population of South Africa exclusively.  The founding of this Medical School was part of the philosophy of the government at the time to keep racial groups separate from one another.  The government run by the National Party recognised that the number of doctors to service the Black communities was inadequate.  They wanted to establish a medical school specifically to train Black doctors that could treat the diseases of their own communities.  This would help to keep the Black labour force healthy and to prevent the spreading of diseases to the White communities, in which Blacks via the migrant labourers and domestic workers. \n During the four decades of its existence the Medical School established a fine national and international reputation for academic rigour and unwavering commitment to the community it served despite suffering years of political harassment, inequitable state funding and a chronic lack of space, facilities and equipment.  It has made an invaluable contribution to medicine in providing until 1976 when the Medical University of South Africa and Medunsa opened, the only undergraduate medical training open to Black students in the country.  \n The Medical School was physically separate from the main campus of the University of Natal, Durban.  The University has not taken as keen an interest in the Medical School as a did with the other faculties and it became a sort of foster child of the University.  Since students of the Medical School are Black they had very little interaction with the other University of Natal students who were mostly White.  Blacks had a separate residence and were not allowed to use the sport facilities or library on the main campus.  In fact Black students were not allowed to wear the blazer with the emblem of the University.  This physical separation of the differences in facilities led to a struggle between the students and the University administrators who, from the student viewpoint, did not do enough to change iniquities amongst students.  \n The University of Natal was one of the last universities in the country to maintain segregated residences.  Forcing the Black students to live in the same residence called Alan Taylor Residence, and subjecting them to adverse conditions in which to study created the place and climate for people to exchange ideas and bond together in the fight against apartheid.  The University of Natal Medical School was one of the most fertile nests for political activists and future leaders of the country, leaders such as the late Steve Biko, Dr Mamphele Ramphele the vice chancellor of UCT, Dr Nkosozana Zuma, Minister of Health, the provincial premiers such as Dr Frank Mdlalose and Dr Ben Ngobane and many of the provincial MEC's for health have come from this medical school.\n The Black Consciousness Movement was born at Alan Taylor Residence.  Intimidation, harassment and detention by the Special Branch of the Security Police was a major problem.\n The Medical School was officially called the University of Natal Non-European Section initially.  After the Black Consciousness Movement started students successfully campaigned for the name to be changed to the University of Natal Black Section.  Currently it is referred to as the University of Natal Medical School.\n The idea behind opening a medical school at the University of Natal was to provide medical training for Blacks, mostly Africans.  However the medical school had difficulty in finding an adequate number of Africans who qualified for entrance into medical school due to the inferior primary and secondary educational opportunities available to them.  As a result the Administration adopted a quota system to allow for fifty percent of the admissions to be African and fifty percent Indians and Coloureds.  Over the years the proportion of students body has become dominated by Indians.  The change in the composition of the student body was due mainly to the fact that some students,  mostly African, had to repeat certain years of study and did not complete these years of study in the allotted period of time prescribed by the University and were excluded.  Some of the reasons for this included time constraints due to their political activities and the inadequate educational training prior to coming into medical school. \n For many years students were admitted into a year of study called the preliminary year which was designed to provide students with better preparation in the basic sciences before they entered the first year.  However this programme was abolished because it was widely perceived not to be fulfilling its purpose.  \n African students got the smallest bursaries from government.  Some of the bursaries came with the stipulation that once the students became doctors they had to return to their own communities to administer health services.  They were expected to learn enough to treat the diseases of their own people and not necessarily learn highly technical procedures.  Therefore King Edward VIII hospital, with its substandard facilities, was an adequate hospital for training these doctors.  Despite these difficulties some \n2,500 students have graduated from the Faculty of Medicine, a record unmatched by any other South African university.  The school has also trained hundreds of Black doctors to specialist status. However this number is still woefully inadequate to deal with the health crises facing the country.

            "Thank you very much.\n Students in their early years felt there was very little or no support for their protest activities against the injustices surrounding them.  In the 1980's there was much more support for students involved in politics and this included reschedule of examinations and also the opportunity to write examinations while in detention and all the support structures.  However, despite these measures, students felt that not enough had been done by the University.  Students had boycotted graduation since the late 1970's because they felt that the University was predominantly White and racist, that conditions at the Medical School were inferior to those at the main campus of the University, that there were unfair rules and difficulties in transport from the residence to the medical school, that Black people were unfairly bypassed for promotions and that most of the administrative staff, secretaries, receptionists, etc were White.\n They also felt there were many outstanding doctors produced by the Medical School but none of them were appointed as professors or head of department.  However other Medical Schools were willing to appoint them in these positions, for example Professor Ephraim Mogokong, Professor Madivati and Professor Macqina.  The students were protesting the trend of not promoting Africans although they were not saying that those who were appointed were not qualified.  This went on until 1995 when the University held a reconciliation graduation and apologised for their unfair practices and actions of the past.  \n The high failure rate of students, especially Africans in the second year and to a lesser extent in the third year of study has been a major cause of concern.  Many students were excluded from Medical School for failing in the second year.  This caused great bitterness amongst students because the Medical School appeared to be doing very little or nothing in addressing the problem.  In the early days it was the exception rather than the rule that students would receive their degree without repeating second year.  Many students were excluded after their first attempt at second year even though they had successfully completed the preliminary year and first year without having to repeat either year.  This has also caused great economic hardship to students and their families.  The nature of the courses in second year have changed but the failure rate remains a problem and students are still unhappy about the rules relating to exclusion.\n In the late 1980's the University considered opening the Medical School to White students. Every province in the country had a medical school for Whites except Natal.  However the students were not prepared to concede that this medical school should be opened.  They argued that given the needs of the country more Black doctors were needed and since other medical schools were practising apartheid, this restricted the number of Blacks who could be admitted to their institution which the University of Natal and other institutions.  The students were prepared to reconsider the position only if other medical schools opened their doors to Black students and until new constitutional guarantees were placed.\n In fact the primary reason that the University of Natal could not open itself was that the students would not allow it.  It is only in the last two years that White students have been admitted.\n Students also fought against the conditions at the King Edward VIII Hospital, and also staff had protested against racial discrimination in the hospitals in the Durban Metropolitan area.  Indian doctors had refused to accept positions at Addington Hospital which admitted White and Coloured patients on the ground but Indian and African patients were not admitted to this hospital.  \n Furthermore African doctors were not permitted to work in Addington Hospital.  Doctors were punished for protesting against the prevailing conditions. Some were denied paid leave to go to conferences or to get further training overseas whereas other doctors would get paid leave for these activities.\n It is noteworthy that students at the Medical School did not engage in protest activity which involved violence or damage to Medical School property.  The administrators at the Medical School had tried to make changes at the Medical School but did not always have the backing of the University.  Despite the fact that they were not always effective in changing the adverse conditions, many felt that it was important to stay and fight in whatever way they could, rather than resign and be replaced by someone more conservative.  Also the Medical School was under close scrutiny by the Security Police and the Administration would try to help as far as they could in the late '80's.  \n King Edward VIII Hospital was initially a hospital for African and Indian patients.  However, the patient wards were segregated as well as the tea rooms and changing rooms for the doctors.  In the 1970's RK Khan Hospital was opened for Indians.  At this time all the Indian patients were moved to RK Khan Hospital and King Edward VIII Hospital became an African hospital.\n In the early years the first difficulties doctors of colour faced were from sisters in charge of wards in the hospital who were White and who resisted taking orders from doctors of colour. These sisters were subsequently told to either resign or transfer to other hospitals.  Most were transferred and the ones that remained were willing to work with Black doctors.  Over a period of time more Black sisters were appointed by the Provincial Health Administration.  \n Conditions at King Edward VIII Hospital were inadequate and not conducive to caring for patients. The hospital was overcrowded, lacked sufficient sanitation facilities and was understaffed.  The hospital was much poorer than Addington Hospital which admitted White and Coloured patients.  It was difficult for the administrators to get equipment to make King Edward VIII Hospital a proper teaching hospital. For many years patients would be put on floor beds if the hospital had already reached capacity because Black patients could not be transferred to the other hospitals.  \n The medical equipment at King Edward VIII Hospital was often old and outdated.  The new equipment that the hospital often got was that which got discarded by the Addington Hospital.  \n These adverse conditions made it difficult to treat the patients as humans in such an inhumane environment.  There were not enough toilets to accommodate the number of patients in the ward.  For example the obstetrics and gynaecology ward had 70 beds but at times it operated at 200% capacity an there were only five toilets for these approximately 140 women. \n It was not until the 1990's that the hospitals became integrated and the patients could be transferred to other hospitals that had empty beds.  For a long time there were no intensive care units at King Edward VIII Hospital.  These facilities were available at Addington hospital which refused to accept Black patients.  \n Doctors at King Edward VIII Hospital had a problem because whenever they protested there were difficulties, especially regarding their conditions of service.  \n Black students were not allowed to train in the White hospitals for example the Addington Hospital.  Some doctors felt that their training suffered from the fact that they were forced to do their training and internship at King Edward VIII Hospital.  The segregation of hospitals limited their training to one race and they could not get the opportunity to study First World diseases.  \n Some also felt they did not have the opportunity to use certain types of technology due to the inadequate equipment at King Edward VIII Hospital.  Others did not feel that it hampered their training at all.  Most of the graduates at the Medical School felt that the overall training was of a very high standard.  \n At King Edward VIII Hospital there was also very poor accommodation for Black interns that either had to live in or spend the night at the hospital due to long shifts. The accommodation for White interns was separate and superior, the Black students felt that if they complained they would not be given jobs.  \n Everyone was encouraged to do postgraduate work, however, most of the postgraduate students were White and Indian.  Few applicants went on to do postgraduate studies because of financial constraints and because of the perceived lack of upward mobility. Many had to take care of their families or repay loans and thus opted to go into private practice.\n The question of inequitable compensation has already been dealt with, but when staff were engaged in protest activity they would receive support from their White colleagues in principle although no concrete action had been taken at that time, and two of the doctors who were leaders in the strike were targeted to be punished by officials.  These two doctors were not allowed back into their positions after the strike and interns were told that they had to apologise in writing, otherwise they would be stopped from even getting another position in the country and thus would  never be able to practice as a doctor.\n Most of the administration of our Medical School including professors and heads of department were White males, especially in the early years of the Medical School.  This changed slowly over time as Black medical doctors gained the credentials to fulfil professorial administrative posts.  However, there has never been an African appointed to professor or head of department.  There has only been one Coloured member appointed as head of department and only two females appointed to this position.  Many of the doctors at the Medical School have been frustrated by the lack of role models and implicit glass sealing that they face in terms of promotion and advancement.  Many feel that the Medical School overlooked highly qualified African doctors who left the University of Natal Medical School to become professors at other medical schools, or have been appointed to top levels in government.\n In the early 1980's many politically active doctors believed that a black list had been drawn up by the security forces of names of doctors that were too politically active and were therefore a risk to the security of the State.  The black list affected doctors in four fundamental ways:\n They were prevented from attaining any governmental positions,\n they were denied promotions;\n many were denied international travel by not being given a passport; \n and many could not publish in the scientific press which further hampered the prospects of promotion.\n For people who were black-listed the security police tapped their phones, threatened them and their families, raided their homes and offices, held them in detention without reason and even tortured them.\n Some faculty members also felt that certain departments were much more difficult for Blacks to get jobs in than in other departments.  \n The State pathologist said that they were forced to have a security office system.  This may have hampered their autonomy of pathologists.\n     Ethics and human rights patients were treated very badly due to the conditions at the hospital but often this was the only exposure to the patients that the doctors had. So they never learned anything any differently. Respect for patients was not always instilled. \n Concerns were also raised that some of the research done on patients at King Edward VIII Hospital was not done in an ethical manner and that the Declaration of Helsinki was not always observed.  \n Patients were not always properly informed of the risks of the procedure and other options available. \n So in summary, culpability, complicity of the University and the Province, both the University and the Province could have done much more.  They should not have accepted such conditions for a medical school and its teaching hospital.\n Now regarding recommendations which are not in the submission that you have.  Mr Chairman we would like to suggest that apartheid was a process of dehumanisation.  That it reduced the majority of our people to objects or physical entities. Imperceptibly medicine also became dehumanised.  The focus was on the disease and not the person, their family and community.  South Africa is politically free, however our people need to be healed spiritually, mentally and physically if we are to create the type of society and country that we all desire.  Doctors, medical schools and their teaching staff, and medical students can become important instruments for this change.   The most important step in this process is to re-humanise medicine.  \n Firstly we need to view every person as a whole being.  In other words we need to recognise that it is the spirit, mind and body which makes up a human being and that these aspects are intimately interrelated.\n Secondly, we need to embrace the concept of health rather than disease.  Health should be viewed as a state of perfect spiritual, mental and physical wellbeing, not merely the absence of illness and infirmity.\n Thirdly, we need to accept that a person is part of a family, part of society, part of our country and part of the global village, the world.  Therefore the state of a person has far-reaching implications which go far beyond the individual. \n The medical curriculum has to be changed accordingly.  It has to become human centred, in other words, person centred, family centred, community centred.  \n The social sciences and the humanities need to be introduced and issues such as human rights and ethics covered. \n Respect for all people including those of different ethnic backgrounds and respect for all cultures needs to be instilled.  \n The new graduates should have received training which enables them to have a broader vision so that they can be more socially aware and socially responsible. The new graduates will find it natural to take up issues such as human rights, violence, crime, child abuse, pollution of the environment and global warming irrespective of where in the world these issues may arise because they understand that these issues impact on health.\n In short, change is not merely desirable, it is essential.  The narrow outlook of the past can no longer be justified.",

            "Madam Chair, if it's alright what we'd like to do is an introduction that will provide a context for the district surgeons.\n First, on behalf of all of the members of the AAAS team I'd like to express appreciation for the invitation of the TRC to participate in these historic hearings.  Of the 16 Truth Commissions that have preceded South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission we are not aware that any of them have undertaken a sectoral analysis and we think that this is one of the many contributions that South Africa will have to the process of a country coming to terms with its past. \n For the people who don't know what AAAS is, the American Association for the Advancement of Science is the largest federation of scientific, medical and engineering societies in the world.  It also has an individual membership of 143,000.  For 20 years we have had a human rights programme that has dealt with issues affecting the health, the scientific and the engineering sectors as well as the application of scientific methodologies to the protection and promotion of human rights.\n In 1989 the AAAS sponsored a medical mission of inquiry to South Africa that published a report \"Apartheid Medicine\", that examined how legal structures in the culture of apartheid denied the majority of South Africans decent medical care and contributed to massive violations by individuals and institutions in the health sector.  \n The report also examined the role South African professionals played in helping or hindering the promotion of human rights.\n When we received the invitation of the TRC, AAAS assembled a consultative team, including the US-based NGO's, the Physicians for Human Rights, the Committee for Health in Southern Africa, the American Psychiatric Association, the American Public Health Association and the American Nurses Association.  Six of the ten members of our team were introduced this morning.  I would like to introduce the additional four members.  Dr Barbara Nicholls, Miss Diane Kunz, Dr Gregory Bloch and Dr Jack Geiger.\n Why has the international community been concerned about violations of human rights in the health sector in South Africa?  Health professionals have a particular responsibility to protect and promote human rights, not only because human rights violations have devastating health consequences, but also the protection and promotion of human rights may be the most effective means to providing the conditions for health and well-being.  \n In South Africa in the past, and I might add in many other countries, a narrow conception of health and ethical responsibilities of health professionals has contributed greatly to silence and inaction in facing the suffering caused by human rights violations.\n There is also another reason that international NGOs and academics have been so concerned, and that is that the violations which took place in this country, and which we've heard about in great detail in the last two days, have been systematic violations of international human rights standards, and international codes of medical ethics.\n Next year will be the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  In the aftermath of the holocaust and the Nuremburg Trials, to which Bishop Tutu alluded at the opening of the hearings, the international community said \"never again\", and to that end formulated an international bill of human rights.\n Beginning with the Universal Declaration of human rights adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948 the international community has drafted a series of instruments that recognise the inherent dignity and equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family.   The Universal Declaration, broadly considered to be a common standard of achievement for all peoples and nations, enumerates some two dozen specific rights to which all persons are entitled without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.\n Two of the most fundamental protections are the right to life, liberty and security of person and the right to freedom from discrimination.  \n Other basic civil and political rights that are articulated in freedom from torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment, freedom from arbitrary arrest and detention and the right to a fair trial.\n In addition the text of the Universal Declaration sets forth a series of social and economic rights, among them that everyone has a right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and his family including food, clothing, housing, medical care and other social services.\n  The principles enumerated in the Universal Declaration are further developed in a series of human rights conventions.  States which ratified these instruments and thereby become States parties are legally bound by their provisions.  Well over 130 countries, including virtually all major nations, have ratified the two most important of the instruments, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.\n Our submission goes into some of the specifics of the standards that are in each one of these covenants that provide a framework for the health sector in South Africa.  Given the fact that we are running short of time I won't go into that. \n But I would like to point out that in 1949, the year after the Universal Declaration was formulated there was, of course, the momentous election in South Africa which set the country on the course of apartheid, which in its very nature violated these fundamental standards.  \n I think that it's something that we can all celebrate that as we move into the 50th Anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, that the political system here has changed fundamentally and symbolically as well as South Africa has begun to ratify the International Conventions.  We hope that they will provide an active set of standards that the new and reformed medical sector will now seek to embody.",

            "I will just briefly address the question you asked us to focus on.  In our submission we did have a detailed section about district surgeons that attempt to illustrate some of the problems confronting the health professions under the system of apartheid.  Through their inability to resolve the role conflict between duty to their patients and duty to the apartheid state, the district surgeons serve as a prime example of the violation of international law and standards that Audrey has just spoken about, in the discharge of their professional role.\n In our written submission we state that while there was considerable variation in district surgeons' attitudes towards their patients, and in the quality of care they provided, district surgeons did, in the main, accommodate themselves to the dehumanising system in which they were operating.  \n District surgeons commonly participated in abuses by failing to record and investigate apparent signs of abuse by not insisting on appropriate treatment and by not respecting doctor/patient confidentiality.  While it appears that district surgeons did not generally participate actively in torture they rarely spoke against inhumane practices.  While there were a few bright spots, those few who did speak out against the abuses received little support from their colleagues as we have heard in testimony over the last day and a half, suggesting that the problem here was not restricted to a few bad apples, but in fact did represent a collective professional failure to responde appropriately.\n Fundamentally then, district surgeons failed to honour the responsibilities that they had to their detainee patients under, not just international law to which South Africa was not then States party, but even under South African law.\n This problem of complicity and torture, or the denial of treatment, the falsification of medical records, the violation of medical neutrality, as we've heard testified to yesterday in which patients were actually seized by security forces while under treatment, all point to this larger picture that we've heard in such graphic detail.\n We would like to make three principle recommendations which we will then follow-up in our longer detailed submission later in September. \n First, the category of regulation and enforcement.  The discipline of physicians in South Africa under apartheid obviously was woefully inadequate and the Council failed to function in any meaningful way.  Based on the testimony submitted yesterday I have to say that I have concern that there is in place the kind of reform at that self-regulatory system that would be necessary to protect against future abuses.  I believe that there needs to be a complete restructuring and a recognition that self-regulation has not worked.  \n The SAMDC needs to be replaced by a pro-active group with representation by progressive community institutions such as women's organisations, labour unions and church groups.  What we heard this morning about the changes underway with the Nursing Council, I think provides an example that the physicians group might well look to.\n Second, accountability.  There needs to be a human rights monitoring body that is both independent and yet empowered to investigate allegations of human rights abuses, including access to patient records.  \n It is difficult for us, as a group of Americans, to suggest exactly the form that this might take to accommodate to the values and the mores of South Africa, but we do believe that part of a strong, civil society that is now beginning to emerge in South Africa will create a supportive ground for the creation of such an independent monitoring body.\n Third, education.  Education and health and human rights should be provided at all levels.  We've heard others testify to the same concern.  Within the health profession schools it must be linked to the examination system in order to assure that human rights education will not be marginalised or trivialised by faculty and students alike.\n Re-certification and re-licensure of graduates should include requirements for participation in human rights education and training.\n While we applaud the efforts described by MASA to work with the seven South African Medical Schools to develop ethics curricula, we do not believe that this goes far enough.  Given the apartheid past and its legacy we believe that education in the areas of social, cultural and economic rights, as well as civil and political rights go above and beyond bio-ethics in the context of the diadic doctor/patient relationship or nurse/patient relationship.   It is necessary, in order to understand fully the social determinants of health and disease in South Africa, to appreciate the nature and extent of psychological barriers that might prevent the full disclosure of symptoms and history by patients still wary of the system; to sensitise health professionals to the origins of the distrust which many patients will continue to feel in months and years to come, and to identify residual, structural impediments to the full guarantee of human rights to the citizens of South Africa, whether patient or health professional.\n Thank you.",

One of the healthy things that I believe would be useful here would be to create regular fora in which people could come, almost like a clinical pathological conference and say in the last week I was faced with the choice to do this or that, I am not sure I made the right choice but this is what I did.\n Michael Balant(?), the late British psychiatrist in his classic work, The doctor, the patient, the illness\", talked about the value of confidential small groups of health workers getting together on a regular basis to share the problems confronting them in practice, ethical, moral, legal problems.  A seductive patient, a problem where confidentiality breaches some other kind of family relationship problem, I think here, given the 45 years that you have just been through, that it would not be at all inappropriate to designate a regular opportunity for health workers to come together and to recognise that these are difficult tasks to sort out.  People haven't had a lot of experience in dealing with them and then to work that in to the curriculum for health and human rights.",

Organisations that form DeNOSA are TRANA, PNINA(?), SINA, BONA, KNO, (...indistinct), SANA and CONSA.\n In November 1996 all these organisations unified thus forming one very strong organisation in South Africa.  They thus shared their assets and their membership.  The organisation has just gone through the first democratic elections in the country of the nursing profession and the boards that have come out as a result of these elections, that's the national and provincial board, we start operating in July.\n For the nurses of South Africa the process of unification and transformation is a major step.  It is therefore of great concern that these submissions that have been made today will not harm and destroy the unity that is being developed. \n DeNOSA submits that the input of apartheid legislation constituted gross violations to the rights of nurses and nursing in South Africa.  In all our submissions that are being made today we cover areas like violations of human rights of nurses and the nursing profession as a whole; of nurses as women, nurses as men; nurses as health care givers and nurses within the nursing education.\n The intention of DeNOSA is to develop and initiate, with assistance of the support from the TRC a reconciliation and a re-correction process that would meaningfully explore and expose past injustices within the nursing profession.   Having made these introductory remarks a full submission will be presented shortly.\nVIDEO ADDRESS ENDS",

            "At leadership level DeNOSA is committed to engaging with the TRC process as the consequences of the period in question have left severe divisions within the nursing profession that perpetuate distrust, resentment and bitterness.\n Nurses have welcomed the opportunity to be heard and want to participate in the process.  They are committed to and support a larger participatory and inclusive process that results in individual and group submissions as part of our final report.      \n To protect the respondents and to encourage participation DeNOSA has secured an undertaking from the South African Interim Nursing Council that nurses making voluntary submissions to the TRC will not be subjected to professional conduct review.\n As we have mentioned DeNOSA came into being in 1995.  It was the first professional group within the health sector to do so and this was as a result of three years of wide and inclusive negotiations with all groupings of nurses within South Africa.  After a further 19 months, in October 1996, unification was achieved with the dissolution or merger of all pre-existing nursing organisations.  \n The process of negotiation has been a difficult one and in some cases very painful.  The current challenge to build unity amongst members, who represent great diversity, is huge. In understanding these dynamics the TRC will appreciate that the energies of the organisation have been largely directed towards issues of transformation, both within the profession and the health sector, as well as holding the first democratic elections of the organisation.\n For this reason the submission that has been presented in writing to the TRC, and the oral submission today, is very much a preliminary submission.  The Joint National Board expressed a deep concern that the TRC process should not erode the unity that is being developed.  The Board therefore decided that separate submissions from the leaders of the former organisations would be counter-productive to the process of building unity, and so at this stage this submission aims to offer a broad perspective on nursing during the period under review.\n We recognise the limitations of the preliminary submission.  One of these is that there are many perceptions of the truth in relation to specific issues.  But rather than support one perception only we recognise that our history has shaped us in different ways and that we experience and interpret events differently.  For that reason we will accommodate these tensions in our submission in an attempt to illuminate our past.\n In the final submission that will be made in writing in October greater detail, with careful corroboration of evidence and verification will be included.  For example, the roles of the various nursing organisations, and nurses in often side-lined sectors like the mining sector, prisons etc.\n As nursing is the one profession which most closely resembles the demographic realities in South Africa in terms of race, socio-economic status and the rural/urban mix, and is the health profession closest to the population, the experiences of nurses in South Africa are a useful indicator of the experiences of the population.\n In terms of violation of human rights in nursing DeNOSA submits that the impact of apartheid legislation effected during the period in question constituted gross violations to the rights of nurses and nursing in South Africa.  Enacted by officials of the day whose political imperatives resulted in establishing a culture of segregation, discrimination, inequity articulated through acts, emissions and offences, an environment was created and reinforced at all levels of society where severe strife, conflict, untold suffering and injustices were meted to nurses and their patients.  \n DeNOSA believes that there are many experiences relevant to nurses and nursing that constitute gross violations to the rights of nurses.  Further, they have resulted in severe consequences for nurses, nursing and patients at the receiving end of care.\n Based on the oral submissions of a number of nurses, violations to their rights as nurses have had serious implications for them in a variety of circumstances, including the right of affiliation as members of a professional body.  These violations permeate all levels of human existence, resonating consequences of a social, political, economic, psychological and in particular, spiritual nature.\n The violation of the very essence of human experience, within the context of the spiritual relates to the meaning and purpose nurses attribute to their lives, their sense of worth and dignity and their ability to forgive and apologise.\n Unlike the medical profession there have not been high profile cases as we have heard in the last day or so, but as nurses are the backbone of the health sector, as we keep on hearing, it is very unlikely that nurses are not going to be implicated in some of these human rights violations.  To this end we have informally requested the Health and Human Rights Project to furnish us with any evidence that relates to nurses so that we can have as full a picture as possible in our final submission.\n In the interests of time we do not intend to read our preliminary submission but to highlight certain aspects that have led us to present under specific headings.",

            "Madam Chair allow me a few minutes to indicate these areas of violation of the rights of nurses.\n1. Violation to practice ethically.\n This is in relation to theoretical requirements versus enforcement of law and order where nurses are expected to give patients charged to members from the law.\n    2. Violation of rights to recognition.\n Promotion opportunities were scarce.  Many nurses retired as juniors.\n 3. Rights to practice safely.  Lack of equipment.  Outdated equipment.  Lack of professional development opportunities. Overcrowding of patients in the ward.  Nursing patients on floor beds.  Babies nursed in cots in twos and threes.  Staff shortages that have not been attended to over the years.\n 4. Violation to the rights to provide care.  On an occasion a White doctor failed to put up an intravenous drip and left a dehydrated patient who needed the drip urgently.  A registered nurse managed to put the drip up and on informing the doctor of this the doctor phoned back and said \"pull the damn thing out of that hand\".  When the nurse reported to her supervisor the supervisor said let the drip run as fast as you can so that when doctor return he find the bottle empty.\n 5. Violation of the rights to decision-making processes.\n Nurses and their supervisors find themselves forced to implement policies into which they had no input and to which - which of course they do not support.  This leaves them with anger, frustration and a sense of guilt and they remain with this loss of credibility for appearing to have colluded with the unjust system.\n 6. Violation to the rights to safety and security.\n Nurses associated with people of particular ideologies were persecuted for this association.  Some of them were ill-treated and forced to leave. \n 7. Violation to the rights to practice with dignity.\n The supervisors, who were mostly White at the time, did not believe that Black registered nurses knew anything.  This led to the nurses developing a low self-esteem and self-confidence.\n 8. Violation to the rights to safeguard the dignity of their patients.\n A number of patients, particularly in the mines, an incident is related where males were made to undress and stand naked whilst the doctor examined them for sexually transmitted diseases.\n 9. The violation of the rights of nurses within education.\n Violation of students' rights to equal education.  It is a well-known and well-documented fact that our students learn in inadequate facilities.  Incidents were cited where students were educated in separate institutions and where Black and White were accommodated in the same building the premises were separated by double doors which were kept closed.  Even a communal quadrangle had a six-foot wire fence separating the students from each other.  Even though the curriculum is similar at the end of training the South African Nursing Council issues certificates indicating race, and there are individuals who have qualified who have certificates indicating that they were entered into the register for Natives or Bantu and for Black depending on the regulation that was operative at the time.\n 10. Violation to the rights of tutors to equatable conditions.  \n This has already been mentioned that conditions are not conducive to learning and to studying and that opportunities for professional development became lesser and lesser for the Blacks.\n 11. Violation of the rights of nurses to educational advancement.\n 12. Violation of the rights of nurses to appropriate education.\n It is felt that education has to be appropriate to the setting and to the consumers.  There isn't enough stress on ethics within a human rights context.  There isn't enough stress to culture congruence care.\n The next section deals with violation of the rights of nurses as women.\n1. Women doing the same work earn less than their male counterparts.\n Women were not afforded subsidies and housing loans.  A number of women had to divorce their husbands in order to qualify for these loans.\n 2. Violation of rights of women to maternity leave and reproductive choices.\n Women were made to resign as there was no paid maternity leave.  It was only late in the nineties that this was made available, even then only for 84 days.\n Madam Chair I will hand over to Sheila to continue.",

            "The last violation relates to nursing as a profession, and just some of the things where there's been incongruence between legislation and the type of caring and ethical base that one could expect in nursing.\n Some of these incongruencies in terms of having to implement legislation has resulted in the formation of Homeland structures; the failure of professional associations and regulatory bodies to investigate inconsistencies in health care provision; the failure of these bodies to represent and defend the interests of Black nurses; the failure of these bodies to provide leadership, guidance and protection for nurses in response to political violence.   And then the withdrawal of the South African Nursing Association from the International Council of Nurses in 1973.\n In conclusion.  We request assistance from the TRC for research support to enable us to complete the final phase of this submission on nursing in South Africa during the period under review.  We recognise the need to reflect on the past in order to proceed with planning for the future, and in particular to inform strategies aimed at preventing the recurrence of past irregularities, inconsistencies and injustices.\n However, it would be premature to make recommendations for future action and reparation before this particular process is complete, but these recommendations will be forthcoming in the final submission in October.\n What is clear is that a fundamental shift in attitude is required, both within nursing and the health sector in general which respects the worth and rights of those both seeking care and those giving care.

            "Thanks Madam Chair.  The National Medical and Dental Association came into being on the 5th of December 1982 at a conference in Durban after more than two years of consultation amongst all progressive doctors, dentists and other health workers nationally and internationally.\n In the preamble to its constitution NAMDA proclaimed its acceptance of the World Health Organisation's definition of health as a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.  And perhaps I think that these are things that colleagues within other organisations, both represented here today and over the last two days, probably need to examine in terms of their own submissions in terms of this WHO definition of health.\n It reiterated the belief that health is a basic human right which should be available to all the people, irrespective of race, colour, political belief, economic or social condition.  It further committed itself to creating the conditions for optimum health which can only exist in a free and democratic society.  And I think that's where the variance came in with many of the organisations that saw itself, at that stage, as part of the apartheid State machine, or sharing the world view of White South Africans, and that was earlier alluded to in various things.  Whereas NAMDA felt that you cannot have optimum health for people if you did not have the conditions, the structural changes that needed in society to bring about optimum health, and NAMDA committed itself to creating those conditions as well.\n Its aims and objectives were as follows:\n1. To attain the highest possible level of health for all South Africans.\n 2. To promote and practice comprehensive health care, emphasising both preventive, curative and rehabilitative health care.\n 3. To promote the health and allied sciences at all levels of society.\n 4. To promote and protect the honour and interests of the medical and dental professions, and ensure that every member adheres to the highest ethical code governing the profession.  Again we might have deferred with other organisations when it came to these issues.\n 5. To promote improved standards of teaching in the health, medical and related professions relevant to the needs of the majority of South Africans.\n And I think later on when we address the issue of standards we have to ask ourselves what do we mean by standards when we talk about the issues about linking up with the health needs of all South Africans.\n6. To affiliate or cooperate with any scientific, professional or other groups which contributed to the advancement of (...indistinct), and this was later to the international context.\n And lastly but not the least important;\n7. To actively encourage and develop community and workers participation in all matters affecting health care.\n Now the background to the formation of NAMDA has gone into quite a bit, suffice to say that the Biko saga and the sad story relating to his death was one of the factors that led to the formation of NAMDA.  Let me move on.\n Health professionals in South Africa have long been aware of the damaging effects on the health of the population imposed by a system of racial and economic exploitation.  \n The social consequences of apartheid were so gross, so thoroughly destructible and so widely acknowledged and abhorred by the international community that there could be no avoiding the intrusion into the professional lives of medical men and women in this country.  The idiocy of the pencil test for babies, abandoned babies; of floor beds on one side of the hospital while the other half remains empty; Black medical students in ward rounds that ended in the tea room with the porters while the White students continued with the White professors to the White side of the hospital; Black nurses that could not have White nurses looking after them, and you heard from DeNOSA and maybe their submission later on will point more to that.  \n The issues about conferences upon conferences where government policy was acclaimed in terms of the Transkei Medical Association, the Homelands, the League of Nursing Associations of South Africa where SANA and the Transkei Nursing Association, KwaZulu Nursing Organisation came together, where these conferences were to acclaim and loud-hailing the government policy of the day were seen as being part and parcel of delivering health care to the majority.\n Now the effects of apartheid and its devastating consequence on the majority of our citizens are well-documented.  Suffice to say that it combined class and race to give White South Africans their health care system better than some of the Scandinavian countries, and for Blacks worse than Botswana, a country just north of us.\n We need to note that the health planners and the medical superintendents and the heads of departments of health at that stage, we need to note what positions do they occupy today in South African society.  These issues of separate casualties, separate waiting rooms, do these health planners still have a role in South African society today.\n Thirdly, the formation of NAMDA.  With popular resistance rising in the seventies through the eighties the apartheid regime increased repression, even health facilities were not safe, and you've heard of instances of that over the last two days. \n There were instances of active collusion by health authorities as with the District Surgeon in Colesberg handing over a patient to the police, to possible participation in biological and chemical warfare.  Indeed the doctrine of low intensity warfare had become one of high intensity with deaths, disappearances and detentions being the order of the day leaving us a society deeply traumatised and hopefully this process will bring about healing.\n Bishop Tutu himself spoke about Johnny on a submission to a conference in the Frontline States late in the eighties.  \n\"Johnny....\",\nwrites Archbishop Tutu in his forward to the report of the lawyers committee,\n\"...is real.  He used to be a lively youngster full of life and fun until he fell into the clutches of the security system of the apartheid regime.  It is not quite clear what the police did to Johnny, perhaps it does not matter anymore, what is certain he went in a lively, healthy and normal youngster and he came out walking a human vegetable.  The police did something to him.  It is quite important for the world to know.  Johnny is no figment of a feverish imagination.  I saw him with my own eyes in Kotze House, Johannesburg\".\n These are issues later on when we are talking about handling of children in detention NAMDA campaigned for \"free the children\".  \"Free the children\" in terms of not having a code for the handling of children in detention and these are the issues that we are saying we are at variance with counterparts that presented earlier today.  You could not have a code for handling children in detention.\n Lastly, in terms of NAMDA's coming into being, was the programme to train health workers for Black, mainly rural areas, by the South African Medical Services, the so-called COMOPS, designed to win the hearts and minds, gather military intelligence or a genuine commitment to the poor?  What of the biological and chemical weapons experimentation?  Was it merely defensive?  The Reverend Frank Chikane's poisoning, organophosphates, the death of Sipo Mtimkulu.  It must be noted that the forensic laboratory's services up to now still reside with the South African Police Services. \n The TRC needs to note that health professionals, not just doctors, but biological scientists, psychologists and others would have had to be part of a wider group providing inputs for the destruction of our people, using their knowledge of human physiology and a psyche.  Earlier reports of torture to this Committee and others allude to the use of truth sera(?) being injected to detainees.\n Historical perspectives are such that it's well-documented about the social conditions and the determinants on health and I'm going to leave that out.\n Let me go onto, \"did we know\"?   Given what has been documented previously and what the TRC has heard to date, it is amazing that there are not more health professionals coming forward to testify, similar to Sean, and we would hope that the TRC would continue so that more health professionals could come forward.\n Ergonomics is a scientific discipline and in its simplest definition looks at designing the work place to suit the worker.  Since the earliest days of our mining industry, the backbone of our economy, heated climatisation chambers were set up to design the worker to the workplace.  We need to document what the Chamber of Mines and Wits Physiology Department had done in the early days of designing workers to the workplace.\n Recently there has been widespread news coverage of a public health service study in the United States which began in 1932 and continued until 1972 involving 399 Black men who were left untreated for syphilis to let doctors track the course the disease.  Madam Chair, our own (...indistinct) continue today.  Pneumoconiosis research with volumes of slides of lungs of dead miners in Johannesburg documenting advancing stages of disease, and as yet no interventions.   The various drug trials, the people in Lebodi, the rural doctor who spoke about rural health problems, the ex-miners in Prieska, what are we going to do about them and the destruction of family life in terms of migrant labour?\n Let me move on, NAMDA's structures.  NAMDA was active in all parts of South Africa and enjoyed international support. It grew from 52 members at inception to well over a 1,000 by 1990.  I must pay tribute at this meeting to the international aid organisations and governments which provided funding for the organisation's activities aimed at redressing the effects of the apartheid state.  \n On the other hand the organisations' members were harassed by the State and its structures in various ways.   Firstly, inability to get jobs in the public sector.   Secondly, harassment by the Security Police.  \n Thirdly, mysterious break-ins in our offices in Durban and Port Elizabeth and elsewhere with theft of computers and various documents of the organisation including detainee care records, which led us then to devise substantive ways of disguising names of ex-political prisoners and detainees.\n Second lastly, detention of members, and lastly bombings and death threats against members.  We would like to know who bombed Professor Jerry Kouvadia's house, and that we would ask of the TRC to find that out.\n It was unable for us to hold meetings at some of the medical schools, example, Stellenbosch University campus where the students invited us but we could not go onto that campus.  The meeting was banned by the Rector, the NAMDA meeting at that stage.\n Lastly, we could not get scholarships or research grants, whereas the Medical Research Council continues to contribute to the brain drain of scientists from South Africa by granting scholarships internationally.\n The South African Medical Journal, a reputable health science journal, at one stage devoted an entire supplement, I have a copy of it here, attacking Dr Emjee(?), a former president of the organisation.  A similar article attacking NAMDA dental colleagues appeared in the Dental Association South Africa's journal.  We heard of earlier submissions where the journal refused to tackle what they call \"academic valued articles\", and peer review (...indistinct) articles, and we would like to know what is the peer review of this article in terms of it being there in the supplement of the SAMJ, 18th of July 1987.\n At a branch meeting of the Medical Association of South Africa in the Western Cape in 1987 an Army Intelligence officer addressed that meeting about NAMDA.\n Where is the organisation today?   Unfortunately the Association finally merged with other progressive organisations in 1992 to form SAHSO, South African Health and Social Services Organisation.  Since 1995 a core group of ex-NAMDA doctors have rallied around the umbrella of the Progressive Doctors Group to begin discussions about a united medical association for South Africa that will espouse the true values of health and human rights.\n Very briefly NAMDA's programmes, and this might have an impact in terms of the future function of the TRC and the health sector in general.  There were major health policy initiatives by NAMDA that are now coming to bear within the Department of Health's formulation of health policy and we are glad to say that NAMDA's earliest contributions have contributed in more ways than one to a national health system for South Africa, a new system of medical education and training for the health sciences, and lastly debates on health financing.  Those policy options are now firmly entrenched within the South African Government's programme of action.\n Secondly, care of ex-political prisoners and ex-detainees and their families.  You heard yesterday testimony from one of our colleagues in Livingstone Hospital, of NAMDA's inputs that were made together with other progressive organisations.  We had made submissions to structures such as the Department of Health at that stage, the Medical and Dental Council, from example, the Fort Glamorgan issues in the East London area, the Eastern Cape, however to no avail.  We would like to know where those documents are today and whether there would be a re-opening of some of that evidence.\n In addition the State very soon after NAMDA safeguarding hospitals in the eighties began to move ex-detainees to No.1 Military Hospital.  What was different from public sector doctors, so-called NAMDA doctors treating people in public hospitals than military doctors in no.1 Military Hospital?  There were quite a few ex-detainees, the detainees that were moved to the Military Hospital.\n Lastly there were psychiatrists as you heard today that began to justify detention and justify torture and I think those issues need to be examined further. To the extent that NAMDA began to say that we were treating not post-traumatic stress syndrome, that we were treating continuous traumatic stress syndrome.\n First aid training.  This programme began as a direct result of the violence in the townships and the many mass rallies that were being held.  Many wounded people were arrested in hospitals and thus were afraid to go into health facilities.  Examples abound where security forces surrounded health facilities or set up mobile police stations outside health facilities.  In addition health facilities were at times closed during periods of unrest. \n At that stage Madam Chair, organisations such as St Johns, the South African Red Cross and Noordekulplike were, according to our perspectives, not responding adequately to the needs of the victims of security force action.  They were still continuing with life-saving activities and old age homes.  Content of the training which NAMDA developed was aimed at community based organisations and trade unions and focused on first aid, emergency medical supplies, counselling skills and organisational skills to meet urgent health needs.\n NAMDA members and other progressive health workers were asked to ensure the safety of all patients at health facilities and provide care for the victims of violence, and yesterday was quite an emotional outbreak in terms of Dr Pat Naidoo and other colleagues like Betty at Livingstone Hospital.\n Of special note was an attempt by NAMDA during the latter half of 1985 and early 1986 to get information on the nature of the compound used in teargas.  We needed to know what was in teargas and how to treat it because there were instances coming through of media reports attributing deaths and severe ill health to the indiscriminate use of teargas.  This information was denied to the organisation.\n The next programme was a progressive primary health care network which was launched in 1987 and still remains to today in terms of a highly major grouping of community based organisations and health workers contextualising the political, economic and social conditions which give rise to ill health, and that structure continues to this day.\nIt emphasised community accountability, comprehensive health care and ensure that health workers use their knowledge and skills to service the needs of the disadvantaged.\n We further went on to have a national campaign on apartheid in health de facto in 1987 this was launched.  The campaign had four objectives, to publicise the fact that hospitals were segregated by race; to enable Black patients to be seen at White hospitals; to de facto integrate hospital inpatient facilities and to force government to publicly declare that all facilities are open to all races.   International campaigns that NAMDA engaged in was against torture, detention and racial segregation of facilities for the isolation of health professionals in South Africa, especially the Medical Association, the Dental Association, SANA and such structures, government functionaries and academics.  And particularly when it came to academics who held a fairly liberal view of individual rights versus group rights, and they felt that this was curbing their international linkages.  And unfortunately there are many of them present here today in the audience who still feel that this was a major impact in terms of their own growth, whereas the needs of the majority of the South Africa's citizens were being denied at the same time.\n Lastly, NAMDA campaigned for the release of political prisoners who had health problems.  \n We did publish articles that were not covered in this SAMJ but were covered in prestigious journals like the BMJ, The Lancet and such international journals.  \n The very special programmes that we worked with, there were local programmes like \"Free the Children Rights\" campaigns, etc, and I must say, in conclusion, that all the other programmes while initiated by NAMDA had close collaboration with the Health Workers Association, which later became the South African Health Workers Congress, the Detainees Parents Support Committee; the Organisation for appropriate Social Services in South Africa; the South African Council of Churches and various doctor and dental guilds.\n Some thoughts on the way forward.  Human rights as a discipline becomes part of the curricula in our education system, and the patient's charter of rights needs to be emphasised.  However, we should be wary that the custodians of this human rights culture are not the very perpetrators who benefited from a system in the past.  I find it almost impossible where we find chairs of human rights or whatever ethics that are still held by people from the old establishment.  We need to see about people who were actually denied fundamental human rights taking up those chairs and those professorial posts.\n The annual NAMDA human rights lecture, we had a human rights lecture series be resuscitated in conjunction with the Human Rights Commission and we feel this would be a token to NAMDA and the work that it did in those dark years in terms of the human rights lecture series being resuscitated, where we would then work with local people, the African experience and further experiences in South America where I think those things need to be probed as well, the links in terms of South America and various countries like Uruguay, Argentina etc, and the South African Government and its agencies in those dark ages of the seventies and the eighties.\n Thirdly, very important to the future function of the TRC and its recommendations.  Many of the survivors of the high intensity conflict need health care, especially counselling services, and it's nice to know that Project Curamus is there for ex-servicemen and servicewomen, what about a Project Curamus for the victims and the survivors of apartheid's human rights violations?  One of our own workers who over 20 years worked in the human rights field has currently had major psychological problems and he doesn't have an Operation Curamus to help him.  Can we get the SANDF to assist us further in this field, together with the Department of Health.  Let's extend their services.\n Fourthly, we need a much closer examination of the role of the district surgeons.  They are still present today.  And the delivery of health care to prisoners and victims of State-sponsored violence.  Perhaps we should note that many part-time district surgeons also have those separate segregated facilities.  How many of them are members of current organisations such as MASA?  Should we not be taking them to court, Constitutional and other ways, but apart from the fact of saying part of the conditions of service with Government as district surgeons that you cannot have separate entrances and separate facilities?\n Fifthly, as with the landmines campaign which we applaud the South African Government for taking the lead on, we should begin a campaign against biological and chemical weapons, in fact campaign for peace and promote a war against poverty.  That's the biggest threat to this country, poverty. \n The TRC further needs to explore the relationship, if any, between military regimes, especially in South America and the brutal methods of torture and violation of human rights that took place in our country all these years, in line with biological and chemical weapons offensive.\n Six, seven and eight, in terms of its recommendations the various organisations, Medical and Dental Council, Pharmacy Board etc needs to examine their own rules and that they have started to do.  The professional organisations MASA, DASA, the Optometry Society, the Occupational Therapy Society, there's a whole range of these bodies across the range in South Africa and I don't think the TRC hearings have concentrated enough in terms of beyond doctors and nurses and psychologists.  Many other health professionals helped in some ways or the other to uphold the apartheid state.  They need to examine their roles.\n The voluntary organisations, the Red Cross, St Johns, Noordekulplike, consider their role in terms of the international charters that they were part of, and what were they doing and what are they going to do.\n Lastly, I am part of the Department of Health, and I spoke in my personal capacity, I hope that through my own involvement in the Department of Health we will continue to make changes, with government involvement, with political inputs, to make changes that satisfy the aspirations in terms of the health needs of all South Africans.\n In conclusion the wounds and the scars remain, memories of a continuing past which will not disappear.  We are only beginning to set the economic and social foundations for a health system that meets the needs of all South Africa.  Medical ethics in times of armed conflict are identical to medical ethics in times of peace.  The World Medical Association quotes that the supreme guide of the doctor is his conscience.  How many of us have been true to our conscience?\n I thank the TRC on behalf of NAMDA and its colleagues for allowing us to make this submission and we will continue to work with yourselves in whatever forms to actually take this process forward in terms of the reparation process thereafter.

            "Thank you very much, and thanks for the opportunity to present something in a more structured form than the previous submission we made to the TRC.  It was certainly at their nudging that we were encouraged to try and put down some of our thoughts into a more structured format.\n I perhaps need to explain that I am certainly not speaking here as OASSSA, the organisation, in case some of my colleagues in the audience think I have forgotten organisational discipline, I actually am speaking as the Durban Branch of OASSSA, and more specifically the Detainee and Repression Counselling group.  \n So if I could preface my input to say that this was drawn together by the remnants of that group who have spent time together trying to reflect on the experiences we've been through which in fact we discovered had pre-dated OASSSA days.  \n And perhaps if I could just try and follow the order of your questions and structure my input by saying that there are two specific events, although obviously all the issues that have been raised over the two days informed the response of the organisation and of this particular group.   I think two in particular are linked to the roots of this particular group of counsellors. The one was the mass detentions in the 1980's, and as a result of that, and one of the many responses was the formation of the Descoms, the Detainee Parent Support Committees, and those committees, very quickly, as their work increased, started to pull in legal, medical, psychological, welfare sub-groupings into the Descom structures, and a number of the people who were part of this counselling group had their origins there.  So it goes right back to those days.\n What happened after that was the need to organise perhaps more coherently the work of the psychologists, the social workers, the people who were coming at the detainee work from a mental health or health perspective, and the Natal health group was formed in support of the Descom work.  As that developed more and more we found we were drawing in physiotherapists and doctors, students, and I need to give enormous recognition of the role that students played in the work that we did, they certainly nudged the professionals into moving faster.  \n As this was  going on in the Durban region OASSSA was\nforming itself in the Transvaal, and that was in the 1984/85, so that in the Durban region there wasn't really a need, it wasn't perceived to be a need for us to, at that stage, form an OASSSA branch.\n The next major event I think that shifted the focus of what we were doing to some extent, and also deepened the work was the state of emergency.  That the health care systems and the social service systems of that time were inaccessible as it was were fragmented, were certainly not near to where the need most was.  And what became apparent to us is that we had to have a response to that lack of accessibility.  \n So from the Natal Health Group a new group formed called the Emergency Services Group which worked together with the NAMDA people and a number of organisations that my previous colleague articulated.  So we had a history, if you like, of development, the two main political events that happened, one was the mass detentions and the need to have a response to that from the mental health sector, and finally the state of emergency which really made accessibility to any kind of care and support almost impossible for the people who most needed it.\n I had included here some background on OASSSA, but perhaps if I could throw it out as a challenge to executive members of OASSSA, the need to really write their history and to put together in fact the origins of that organisation as a whole because I cannot hope to do justice to all the areas of work which were included in that organisation's brief. \n If I could just touch on the headings of what OASSSA was attempting to do at that time.  By 1989 there was a branch in the Transvaal which had started in '83, Cape Town '85, Durban '87 and 'Maritzburg '87 and Grahamstown in 1989, so by that time OASSSA was well launched.  It's general brief and terms of reference, because one has to, and I think, I don't want to belabour the point it's been made very well in the last two days, that the mental health services, the practice, the training, the professions, the professional bodies in particular were very closely reflective of the wider society, the divisions, the fabric of the apartheid society certainly was reflected within everything that - all those areas of psychological life.   What OASSSA then tried to do, and I'll talk a bit about, I think the origin in the Transvaal as quite a symbolic beginning for the kind of people who were drawn to OASSSA was, the group of ad hoc students who got together in about 1984 to protest the location of an Institute of Family Therapy conference on the family to be held in Sun City, and I think that that was quite a significant turning point for many people because the total obscenity of holding a conference that was going to be focusing on family life in a homeland where, and in the context of a system which is actually destroying families, did not seem to perturb the organisers of the conference, but it certainly motivated a group of students of the time to say there is something terribly wrong with this type of process.  So I think that was the kind of - then there were moments like that in psychologists lives I think where suddenly having seen South Africa a different it was impossible to say you did not know or you had not thought about it.\n So what OASSSA tried to do really was look at how the Mental Health and Social Service workers were organised and to try, I suppose, in many ways provide an alternate home for the psychologists and social workers.  We had a number -we were quite open membership who just did not feel that they fitted into the traditional professional bodies.  So it did have an organisational aspect to it.  \n It also attempted to research and expose the social, economic and political conditions which we believed undermined the wellbeing of all the people of South Africa, and I don't want to go into that because I think it's very well covered.  We certainly are willing to put a more detailed report together to list those.\n Also to develop and try and offer more appropriate social service which was much more responsive to the real needs of the society as we saw them and based more in the realities of the people who were most disadvantaged in terms of access to the few and fragmented services that were available.  So we also wanted to challenge the way we went about our work.  In fact it was reinforced today, the training of psychologists was happening in this extraordinary vacuum, it certainly wasn't happening in South Africa and you learnt nothing in that training about the realities of the difficulties that the majority of our citizens were facing and the threats to their actual wellbeing.  So we felt it was necessary for us to start examining what we were doing to try and find different models of doing our work.  \n Another part of that was to try and share our skills.  The South African psychologists were very elite, maybe, I am not sure about past tense, but there is very much a sense of \"expertise\" and you do not work with non-professionals.  You do not share your case notes with social workers at one stage.  So we were trying very hard to share our skills as much as we could wherever there were people who were already identified as care-givers in the community.\n So the counselling group in particular, perhaps I need to focus for the rest of the time very quickly on them, the counselling group, the detainee counselling group then which was a subsect of the OASSSA were specifically counselling ex-detainees, their families and their friends.  I think the point has been made that the State was certainly not just targeting individuals, they were targeting the whole social network and support system of people who were detained.  \n And as our work developed we found ourselves more and more working with victims of various forms of oppression and repression and violence as well.  I will go into that in a bit more detail.  Police and vigilante harassment especially in KwaZulu, compulsory conscription, we found more and more that as we became identified as a resource within the community this very small group of health care professionals and workers were being called upon to intervene or become involved in the care of a number of different people, although as I said we did start out as a detainee family and friends group. The work with the detainees, as Barry has mentioned, was carried out very much with NAMDA under the auspices of the emergency services group.  \n The other work that we felt it was important to get involved with was just presenting workshops and seminars and talks on detention and the effects of detention, because at that stage we felt it was really necessary to try and counter the denial of State officials that in fact torture and abuse of detainees was really taking place.  And if you remember the state of emergencies there is no way that you could get that information published.  You remember the Weekly Mail where they eventually published just one blank page because everything was banned and censored at that time.  So we felt it was really necessary to keep running workshops, keep trying to tell people about what was going on.  And again we need to give credit to the overseas supporters who enabled us to publicise some of that work.\n It also arose the need for workshops to try and broaden the net of support in the townships because it became impossible for us to hope to get our services into the townships.  If there were services in the first place people just did not - were not able to enter or leave the townships and the people who were in there we found were enormously resourceful, the ministers, the teachers, the grandmothers in particular, the mothers, were very much seen as the support system within the townships, and we felt it was much more worthwhile for us to train other people who might be able to offer the support at source, if you like.\n We were also involved in a number of other activities which I will elaborate in a more detailed submission.  But perhaps if I could go on because I think it is a slightly different stance that I would like to present here about the way in which being a professional psychologist, or a group of professional psychologists who were trying to do things differently, or work with people who were seen to be enemies of the State, the way in which that actually was made more difficult by our professional organisations, the lack of support from colleagues, also the way in which it compromised the kind of service we could offer to people.  So I'd like to spend a bit of time on that and avoid the repetition of the other inputs.\n The most frequent groups we saw, as I had mentioned earlier, apart from the ex-detainees, were people, activists who anticipated being detained or becoming victims of violence, and in KwaZulu that was quite a significant group.  That created a very particular challenge for the psychologists, because when you were working with people on the run the assumption that you would be seeing people for a number of sessions, or you would see them in a location which was clearly identified was totally thrown out the window. You had to become a person who would go to where people were in hiding, and that usually involved a whole network of moving around. At that time that was not an exercise without its own dangers.\n Another group that started coming to us much more were the conscripts, so they were people who were attempting to avoid the call-up, people who are AWOL and on the run, or those who had completed their military service and were totally traumatised by their experience.  I found that group escalated, especially during the state of emergency, in terms of the students on the campuses.\n The other groups which, and in our more detailed submission we will go into the kind of issues that we were forced with, were ex-political prisoners, returning exiles and I think it's a group that still needs some thought.  And in KwaZulu in particular, displaced children, children who were trying to escape the violence, particularly of the Midlands and Pietermaritzburg and we found this huge wave of street children who suddenly entered the city of Durban.\n From a counselling - another obstacle was just the profession itself, I don't want to go into that too much because I think Lionel captured it very well this morning, but basically the PASA - although we had made attempts to try and get them to take a public stand against apartheid and to actually come out in recognition of a link between apartheid and the enormous damage that it was doing to the people in the country, both PASA and the Society for Student Counselling refused to do that.  Eventually, I think after two years, they came out with very watered-down versions.\n So we were operating without a base, if you like, without the support of our professional body.  I think it was mentioned this morning, they hid behind the professional neutrality or objectivity, and in fact their silence and inaction of the majority of the health professionals possibly, became a way of colluding with what the State was trying to impose at that time.\n It is more than possible that collusion took more of an active form and I think a lot of people have alluded to that, and one encourages the TRC to try and investigate that.  We will certainly cooperate in whichever way we can.\n You also asked me about our role as professional counsellors, and I'll try very quickly to cover what we thought as the ways in which our own professionalism had been compromised.  And even started questioning the quality of the care that we were able to give to people.  It became an issue of your political credibility actually outweighing your credibility as a good psychologist or a good counsellor because of the way in which we were having to offer our services.  We were often seeing people in inadequate facilities because you couldn't see people in the clinics because the State services or a lot of the places where you might have been able to operate were viewed with suspicion, especially by the people on the run, and there were certain buildings which were being watched.  So where we ended up seeing people were often odd ad hoc rooms with no sound proofing, not conducive to counselling at all.  \n The whole issue of confidentiality and record-keeping I think Barry covered it very well, became an enormous issue where it was important for the people we were seeing that nothing was written down and we had to go through all sorts of manoeuvres to try and disguise what we were having to record, but certainly in terms of professional behaviour and ethics, the fact that we didn't keep records and we did not make those available to anyone could have become an issue.   The lack of continuity, you could not assume that you would be able to see people in a follow-up or referral situation.  The referrals were impossible.  You had to rely on the network of people who you were working with and the network organisations to do those referrals.  So again as a professional you were compromised, you were seeing people quite often one off, and you had to try and do what you could within that time.\n Another moral and ethical dilemma and I won't cover the other points that we did raise, was that you needed to maintain your credibility as a profession so that your word was treated with seriousness, but at the same time in doing that you were put into a moral dilemma.  I'll give you an example of having to assess the mental status of conscripts knowing full well that if they were not sick enough they would be forced into a situation which they found totally abhorrent, so you were all the time - your own professional standards were being challenged by the moral consequences of what you were being faced with at the time.\n Also just to mention that it was a very, very small group of people, so the pool of people you could draw on, because you were not getting the support of your professional bodies, it was a very small group of people who were engaged in this work and that put enormous strain on a very small group who were having to face quite seriously traumatised people, be they detainees, torture victims, be they conscripts.  \n So I think if I can in a very rushed way, knowing your time constraints, if I can just move on to some of the recommendations we had in mind and make a commitment to put this into some sort-of form, a report that would stand more substantially on its own. \n Our recommendations for the TRC I think really just underline and reinforce recommendations that have been coming from some of the submissions today, that adequate allocation of resources for the provisional of mental health and community care to those still traumatised by the violence, oppression and human rights abuses of the past, and I think it's been emphasised by others as well, and those who are experiencing ongoing violence, I think there is an assumption that all is well.  Certainly in KwaZulu this is an ongoing need and certainly the facilities are not there.  It's the same people quite often who didn't provide facilities and services before who are still the people in charge of the services if they are there.\n That, in our opinion needs to include ongoing and systematic support for those people who have been encouraged to tell their stories at the TRC.  There is a worry from our side, I think coming from our experience of working with people who you are encouraging to talk about their traumatic experiences, that that trauma is a very ongoing, has very ongoing consequences, and although there's a feeling of relief at having spoken about things I guess it's a plea to the TRC to ensure that their support is an ongoing and structured one for those people who might be telling their stories for the first time.\n A group, as we were talking, our little detainee counselling group, a group that we never thought we would want to focus on as much as it's becoming more apparent to us, that young boys of 18, 19 were forced into compulsory brutal military training.  They were deployed inside and outside the borders, often forced to commit the most dreadful acts, and for them only to discover, in the light of the new political dispensation and public revelations that the rationale for their behaviour and the framing of their experiences was being manipulated by politicians and securocrats and I think we are not even touching what is going on with that group of young people.  I am not talking about permanent force people, or people who made a choice, I am actually talking about those people who were forced at a very young age to commit some of the most vile acts.\n I think the plea to the TRC would be to recommend that all avenues be explored to enable these young people to tell their stories be given a sympathetic hearing and obtain professional assistance.\n The final suggestion, if you like, because we battled to know quite what it was that you were asking, was to have some sort of public - we couldn't decide if it should be a protector or ombudsperson or a monitor for human rights as they pertain to the health sector.  I think a couple of presentations today have underlined that as well.  And they need to include in their brief and monitoring of the consequences of human rights abuses from the perspective of the health sector, and especially the mental health, because quite often mental health is put very low on the list of needs, mental health and community care actually, to monitor whether the professional bodies do actually fulfil their commitment to change, their model and their training, their models, the behaviour, if you like, of their members.  We would take a guess, without hoping to be too cynical about it, that self-regulation of the profession and the health sector just hasn't worked in the past.  \n So it feels like there needs to be an outside agency that is monitoring that, and we have got a number of examples of the kind of things we feel would need ongoing monitoring, even in a society which is perceived to be a democratic one.\n I think then, just in conclusion and I am sorry that I've gone over, is that I think an awareness that came to us as we talked about our experiences that changing the distribution of the political and economic power will not automatically change the nature, accessibility, training models availability if you like of mental and community health services.  It actually has to have a push, something needs to push that to make it happen, and I think we are hoping that the TRC sees itself as having an on-going responsibility in giving further impetus to the kind of commitments we have been hearing today.

            "Thank you Pumla, thank you Commissioners.  The document is now down to about 10 pages so I am sure we will fit into the time allocation.\n This submission is on behalf of the Health and Human Rights Project, which is a joint initiative of the Trauma Centre for Victims of Violence and Torture, and the Department of Community Health at the University of Cape Town.  In developing this submission the Project has drawn on the experiences of a wide range of human rights activists who have been active in the field of detainee work and support for victims of repression over the past years, both in Cape Town and nationally and we want to acknowledge their contribution.\n One of the Project's key aims is to facilitate the process of documenting past involvement of health professionals and their organisations in human rights abuses so as to prevent recurrence in the future and to develop guidelines for how to operationalise that.\n The Project operates with the premise that the health professions and society cannot afford to ignore the past, and that the cost of this selective amnesia which we see so much of with regard to past human rights abuses are enormous.  It is very difficult to see how any trust, within the health sector and also between the health professionals and the broader community can be achieved until the truth is disclosed.\n We believe that only by fully acknowledging and understanding what took place in the professions under apartheid is it possible to achieve reconciliation in the health sector.   Any apologies that are made without this understanding will fail to achieve meaningful progress in moving the health sector to a human rights culture. \n And while the TRC has played an important role in stimulating this process the real challenge that faces the health sector is for health professions to accept human rights as a fundamental responsibility. Real truth and reconciliation can only come from below, from within our institutions and should be seen as part of a larger project to rehabilitate the health sector and build a culture of human rights within it.\n After those comments I just want to digress a little bit and particularly for the benefit of the lawyers who've trooped into this hearing, I think we, as the Project, want to register our concern for this whole process which has led to a situation where many of the cases that we have brought to the attention of the Truth Commission we cannot actually name the particular health professionals involved.  We are not going to name those health professionals but we feel it is really a travesty of the process of truth to arrive at a situation where we cannot speak openly.  We fought for many years for a situation where people will be free to speak the truth and it seems that legal mechanisms have been invoked to limit the extent to which the truth could be disclosed.  We would like the TRC to take note of that, particularly the fact that as far as the Project was concerned we were able to supply the TRC with the names of the doctors as far as we understand within the required time.\n Just in that regard we can talk about the kinds of cases we would have discussed.  These cases would have included, for instance, the poisoning of political activists, the development of chemical warfare capacities for the SADF; the failure to adequately explain the death in detention of Mr Sipo Mutsi, who police claim suffered an epileptic fit and fell backward in a chair resulting in his death; the cooperation of a health professional in the torture of an ANC cadre captured in Messina in 1987 by ensuring that the detainee could survive further interrogation and assaults; a case where there was a failure to report injuries sustained by the detainee Jonas Cheshum Moataung in Johannesburg in 1980, and a host of other cases.  We won't name those. \n What we do cover in our submission is issues of looking at complicity of health professionals in prison and police cells and that's been extensively covered.\n We also raise issues around military health personnel and we particularly want to challenge the SAMS whose presentation yesterday did not touch on any of the issues that we've raised and I think Commissioner Ramashala has certainly posed the question to them, but we have presented evidence regarding programmes which involved the re-programming, the use of aversion therapy for gay men in the military and we believe that these cases require further investigation, and the TRC, we would hope, would follow up in that regard.\n Forensic services have been covered in some detail.  We want to add to the list of cases raised the question of organ harvesting and the way in which practices in which organs were harvested appear to have been substantially racist in the past and has violated the rights of Black families in the way in which shortcuts were taken towards achieving consent for the harvesting of organs. \n In terms of hospitals we've heard quite extensively from the Eastern Cape, and from Mark Bletcher and from others about the way in which hospitals were turned into arms of the security establishment.  I won't go into that in detail, but just to say what is of real concern is that even though the environment has changed and we don't have detainees or injured people arriving at hospitals we do believe the mindset of the hospital administrations has not changed, and I'd like to hand this in to the Commission.  It's a memorandum which was released by the Groote Schuur Hospital region as a hospital notice 12.97 dated 14 May 1997.  This memorandum deals with admission and treatment of foreign patients and it's really about questions of how the hospital should deal with patients who are foreign.  And point 2 under \"Policy\", he talks about \n\"......refugees and illegal immigrants, i.e. people with no temporary residence document.  They may not be accepted as patients unless as in an emergency and their presence should immediately be reported to the nearest South African Police Service office or the Immigration Department by admin reception staff\".\nWhat this means to us is that the thinking in the health services has not changed.  Ten years ago it was detainees, it was people injured in gunshot injuries, today it is another form of social deviant, it's the illegal immigrant without papers.\n We make these points because we believe that even though the health sector at a micro level was complicit in abuses, these were not isolated, these were not events involving a few bad apples, as the term has already been used, rather these abuses arose in a context in which the entire fabric of the health sector was permeated by apartheid and in which human rights were profoundly devalued.  \n We have heard much about the training institutions, and we would support the notion that by the internalisation of apartheid policies and the way they treated Black students and Black patients the health training institutions created the environment where professionals would qualify and be more amenable to the bending of professional ethics to suit the exigencies of security force priorities. \n We want to also state that the lack of attention to ethics in human rights in undergraduate and postgraduate curricula, notwithstanding all the words said today, has changed very little since apartheid days. And particularly that there is a substantial difference between human rights and ethics and the institutions need to consider this in their developments.\n Underpinning this also was a form of medical science that was devoid of considerations of the implications of human rights for the health professions.  Under apartheid we saw a scientific discourse that justified the use of racist terminology and that promoted a research agenda that harmonised with the needs of apartheid.  Scientific data were misused or neglected to support apartheid policy objectives and we give various examples of that. \n Where research findings did present a different view of reality the authorities and hallowed research institutions, such as the Medical Research Council, in medical journals in State departments wasted little time in suppressing this research.  And in particular there's an extensive and very well researched documentation included in our submission of the work by George Ellison and Theo de Wet on material published in the South African Medical Journal over the period 1950 to 1990 which reflected how scientific papers, how editorial policies' letters reflected and reinforced discriminatory policies in the country at the time.\n We've also examined the impact of State policies and we won't go into that in much detail.\n We also want to make the point that health administrators and civil servants under apartheid had considerable leeway as to how vigorously they operationalised the grand plan of apartheid and at what cost to individuals.  I'd like to quote, this is correspondence from the Minister, it's quoted in Federal Council Minutes in the South African Medical Journal and is in relation to correspondence where the Medical Association wrote to the Minister in connection with the question of Black doctors in hospitals.  At that time Black doctors were effectively being precluded from working in hospitals because they were not allowed to give orders to White nurses.  The Minister's response to the MASA is the following, and the translation from Afrikaans is mine so you must bear with me. \n\"On the first aspect, in other words the question of the patient choosing the doctor, the State has controls because the State provides the facilities and equipment for the treatment of the patients.  For reasons, that are not to be discussed now, the government's policy states that separate facilities will be provided for different race groups in so far as practical.  The general policy permits the provision of facilities and equipment for such patients, in others words White patients who were going to be treated by Black doctors at public hospitals, only, where in the opinion of the hospital authorities, it is practically feasible\".\nAnd this is the point, the Minister goes on to argue,\n\"I am not aware of the norms applied by directors of hospital services and because the Minister and the Department have no control over the way the Provinces apply their practices within the overall national policy.  I unfortunately cannot give any information as to whether the directors apply their policies in a uniform manner\".\n We believe this means that the directors of hospital services in all the provinces of the country need to answer very explicitly to the Truth Commission to what extent they applied their own discretion in implementing apartheid policies in health care. \n We also want to make the point that the private sector, which has enjoyed relative freedom from the constraints of public bureaucracy was also complicity in applying apartheid.  Even to this day, less than three years from the turn of the century, we are still aware of racist discrimination in private practices.  We've heard it today.  We see it documented in the papers.\n I think perhaps for time we would like to go on to probably the most important issues in the health sector, and that's the issue, the failures of the organisations representing the health professions to distance themselves from the policies of the apartheid government.  The neglect of Black health professionals was a common theme to all the disciplines and is symptomatic of the profound inability of the professions under apartheid to come to terms with their role as advocates for human rights.  And as we have heard today these organisations covered up abuse, they acted as apologists for government policies, they actively vilified colleagues who were prepared to stand up for justice and human rights.\n For example the language and concerns of the Medical Association, as they acknowledge, reflected a world view that believed in maintaining the security of the State above human rights considerations.  But we also want to say that it was not only that, there were also issues of placing international esteem and status above the recognition that much was not well with the health of South Africans.\n Notwithstanding the failure of MASA to take action against the doctors who treated Steve Biko; the MASA's failure to condemn apartheid and detention without trial; the abuse of the South African Medical Journal for its own political agenda, perhaps the most fundamental criticism of MASA is that it definitely was an organisation that was permeated with an anti-human rights culture.  \n In the 1980's, as Barry earlier pointed out, it sought and received advice from military officers.  In our submission we also point to the fact that the 1977 MASA annual congress which was held in Bloemfontein in that year, ironically a city from which Indians would be forbidden to be present in for more than 24 hours without a permit, had a session focusing exclusively on military medicine, and this was hailed as a great innovation.  We want to ask why in the year following the Soweto uprisings, with the bloodbath that swept the country, there was not a mention of the costs to human health and human rights of this uprising, and yet the Medical Association chose to make military medicine a feature of its congress in that year.\n We think it's not only in the formal links with SAMS that an association with security concerns can be built, but it was very much within the culture of the organisation. \n To this point we also want to refer MASA to the book, the Super Afrikaners, in which it is fairly easy to identify members who were Broederbonders.  In fact the general secretary of the - the former general secretary at the time was a Broederbonder and as far as we could tell at least three of the publications committee members in the eighties were members of this organisation.  We have no idea to what extent the Broederbond membership permeated other leadership structures of the organisation.\n Now we do acknowledge that the MASA of the nineties has clearly undergone major changes, but it's not apparent whether these changes involve a change in the fundamental culture of the organisation.  It appears, and certainly from the submission made today, that an assumption that increasing Black membership of the MASA is going to solve the problem, but it's not clear to us whether MASA is really able to appreciate and operationalise a commitment to human rights.  \n For example the comment made earlier that MASA's commitment to self-examination was only possible because of the TRC process is profoundly disturbing to us.  We cannot see why a professional organisation that would seek to maintain the standards of the profession could not have embarked on this process long ago through mechanisms and structures that it could have developed entirely independent of the TRC.\n Secondly, we are not quite clear why the organisation has to wait for a complaint about members who practice apartheid medicine.  One simply has to go, drive to De Doorns in the Boland and see the farm workers standing outside the garage in the rain while the paying patients, most of whom are White, but some of whom are Black, are inside in a comfortable waiting room.  \n And many of the MASA leadership live in Cape Town and would have had the benefit of a Cape Times supplement examining the state of the Nation in which an advice office worker in Coligny in the Free State says very explicitly the local general practice is racially segregated.  There is no reason why one has to wait for a complaint to reach the organisation before one acts on that.\n I do believe that the MASA is genuinely committed to addressing these issues but it needs to demonstrate that in practice.  I think many of these issues apply to other professional organisations as well.\n Further, we need to examine the role of the Councils, and that's been touched onto some extent.  I think yesterday's presentation by the Council confirmed our greatest concern that we don't understand why the Council cannot be pro-active about defending human rights in this country.  We want to know what part of legislation actually precludes the Council from establishing a commission or from doing an investigation, or from commissioning a university or an NGO from doing some work to defend human rights, or to establish human rights in the health professions.  I don't think that has been adequately answered and it points to a critical issue in the need for fundamental reform to the Councils.\n We do want to make the point that not all health professionals chose to comply with abusive practices.  There were many health professionals who actively defended human rights under apartheid repression and many who paid dearly for their actions.  The point we wish to make is that notwithstanding the context, the overwhelming plethora of security legislation and power, individual doctors and other health professionals could and did make choices.  And when we consider the history of the health sector we need to be clear that there were choices that could be made.\n In terms of common themes the one issue that emerges all the time is clinical independence of health professionals being compromised, either by a plethora of legal and institutional frameworks or by the active complicity of health professionals.  There obviously were cases where health professionals may have unwittingly participated in human rights violations, but there were also cases where health professionals have been more than active in taking steps which have led to the violations of individual human rights.\n We also want to make the point that even though there was a plethora of health legislation, a plethora of security legislation, there were a whole stratum of regulations and administrative practices in hospitals in the district surgeonancy that emerged out of dark offices that were simply borne out of the culture of the health services service to the apartheid security forces.  So hospitals would gag their own staff, district surgeons would be subject to certain internal directives which prevented them from taking steps to protect their patient's health.  These institutions reproduced the apartheid states' intentions at local level to ensure that health professionals were compliant.\n However, when we highlight the power of the contextual constraints we do not argue that individual health professionals can be absolved of responsibilities.  To do so would be to introduce the degree of de-construction that is not grounded.  Quite simply one cannot say, for example, that district surgeons can be absolved of any responsibility for complicity in detention or the death penalty, or corporal punishment; military doctors who received orders to assist in torture by applying medical skills were not devoid of choices.  Psychologists who were drawn into devising better ways of interrogation cannot simply rationalise their contributions as technical.  The toxicologists whose skills were put to use in covert operations cannot argue as the Nazi doctors did that they were simply doing their job.  \n I think Wendy, as a Commissioner, in her case, it's a clear example where action could have been taken, but we need to ask why there were not more district surgeons like Wendy who refused to comply with these practices.\n The evidence presented in our submission supports the notion that many health professionals acted more freely in abuses.  They never attempted to offer assistance to tortured and injured, they effectively really covered up the footprints of the torturers.  \n And one way of looking at this is in terms of parallels with other countries. In his reinterpretation of the Nazi holocaust Daniel Golhargen(?) suggests in his book that the traditional theories for explaining the complicity of ordinary Germans in the Jewish genocide cannot be entirely plausible any longer.  He argues it is difficult to attribute participation in mass killings to the fact that Germans lacked a voice or options or that they were responding to social psychology of group dynamics that compelled them to commit atrocities against their will.  To the contrary he argues that the Germans participated willingly in the abuse, torture and killing of Jews because of the annihilationist anti-Semitism that permeated German society. \n We believe that similar arguments could be made for the complicity of health professionals in human rights violations in South Africa.  The implication of this is that we must reject the bad apple notion of complicity.  It is insufficient and indeed misleading to argue that it was only a few deviant professionals who led the whole profession into disrepute, and rather than identifying a convenient number of scapegoats we need to look at the profession as a whole and understand what made the profession so inherently amenable to cooption by an ideology that denied human rights.\n It's particularly in the area of the lack of professional accountability that this emerges.  The statutory institutions, professional organisations abdicated their responsibilities and in particular they failed the profession and the South African people by refusing to hold individuals accountable for human rights abuses.  We have little doubt that if the organised health professions had sent a stronger message to doctors, namely that unethical conduct would not be tolerated and would result in severe disciplinary action, the history of complicity by health professionals in human rights violations would have been very different.\n In closing this off we also want to remind the Commission about the private sector.  Our contention is that health care providers and corporate interests in the private sector have roles and responsibilities that require examination and redress.  We believe this is a big gap in the current approaches to achieving reconciliation through the TRC and we would like to believe that the TRC shares our concerns related to the need for redress of violations of socio-economic rights.  \n As part of the reconciliation process and of reestablishing trust in the profession we argue that, for instance the environmental and occupational health impacts of activities in the private sector, should be subjected to the same process of scrutiny as initiated by the TRC.  In the long term reconciliation can only be achieved by disclosure of what went on in the private sector as well and a genuine commitment to facilitating redress.\n In conclusion, the challenge is for the health sector, and that is the whole health sector, the institutions, those of training, of research, of professional regulation, for the organisations of the profession and for the State health services and the private sector to embark on some process of serious self-examination.  What could have been done differently?  Why could it have not been achieved?  Did we know enough as to why it wasn't achieved?  Where were the role models?  Has enough been made public to understand what went wrong?  \n There are many other questions that arise in this process, to answer them effectively, honestly and openly is the challenge facing us.  Abuses continue to occur in the health sector.  The process is then not only about digging up the past but about creating an ethical framework to guide health professions in the future.\n We have made extensive recommendations, I am just going to mention some of them, perhaps the most important ones.  We believe a legally binding code of conduct for all health professionals that specifically prohibits participation in human rights violations should be adopted.  There should be a special commission on health and human rights established to implement the recommendations that arise from these hearings and others.  The commission should be comprised of, but not limited to, members of health professions, should include human rights experts, legal advisors and community input.  The commission should have the confidence and support of key stakeholders in the health professions.\n There is a great deal of archival material which we believe is still available if it hasn't been shredded.  The TRC should  use its legal powers to obtain this material in relation to human rights violations in health, in particular copies of district surgeon reports, reports from the International Committee  of the Red Cross, Health Department memoranda and security force records.\n There should also be ongoing documentation of past and current health and human rights abuses.  Cases of abuse should be fully investigated, and we are particularly calling for the reopening of past cases where evidence of complicity exists.\n We also put a challenge to the institutions responsible for training of health professionals to look seriously at the question of human rights education and to make it a fundamental component of curricula.  That institutions are to be transformed to create a culture that respects and promotes human rights and produces graduates who are capable of seeing advocacy for human rights, advocacy for their patients as being part of their responsibilities.\n We believe this hearing will begin a process that will help all of us reach a common understanding to establish a culture of accountability, of respect for human rights and a re-adoption of the notion of health professionals being advocates for the vulnerable.  This we believe is part of the healing calling of the health professions and should be reasserted as an indisputable and inseparable element of the profession's ethos.  Thank you.",

The Health and Human Rights documents it's really quite extensive and it's a pity that we haven't been able to deal with many of the specific issues that you have researched in the documents.  But I want to engage you just for a moment on one of the arguments that you make because I think it is important if you are going to be thinking about reconciliation and the redress of some of the pertinent issues in the abuse of human rights in the practice of medicine and in other sectors in general.  You say that you give the example of people like Wendy and other individuals who stood up for the rights of their patients and you made the point that if people like Wendy could do it, why couldn't the number of people in the health sector who could also speak out, why couldn't they do it.  What worries me, I think it is a concern, but this is true in many sectors of our society in the past, of our history, these questions could be raised in relation to education, to military service where some people left the country or some objected and so forth, but the majority, always it is the majority who do not speak out.

And I think we should be looking at a different way as a form of social engineering which could address these problems rather than look - yes we could look at individuals as well, but I think largely we should perhaps be looking at different forms of social engineering that could re-teach or teach new moral behaviour in this country, and that is my view even as far as it relates to medical ethics.  We need a re-teaching of moral behaviour of new ethics in a different way that will start people at a very early age of their education and I think that way we might be able to have some kind of achievement in the area of the learning of human rights.

Before I proceed may I say thanks for your patience.  I know you have been sitting here for two days and there is a method to this madness, it was by design to actually assign you to the last submission.  It was very important for us that you listened to the two days testimony because ultimately it is the Department of Health that is held accountable as the national health accounting structure, and I hope that you were able to benefit from the presentations for these two days, and that the presentations will help you in terms of joining us to move forward to address the very serious problems that are facing the South African health care system.\n May I make a comment and say that, is it correct that this is just a preliminary submission, am I correct?  Okay.  And you don't intend to read it in its entirety are you?  Okay.  May I ask you to proceed and then I'll come back to prevailing questions.",

            "Madam Chairperson, Commissioners, Ladies and Gentlemen.  True to my personality I would not comment on the fact that we are addressing a Commission only consisting of women. (General laughter)\n It is for the Department of Health and for me, as a public servant who served in those dispensations, an historic and important opportunity to make this submission today.  This presentation is a short overview of the full submission already submitted to the TRC.  And in the light of what has been said today I am pretty sure that we will have to make a subsequent submission dealing with the issues that have not been dealt with sufficiently in the initial one so that we can provide a comprehensive response.\n Before I start I would like to clarify my terminology that I will be using.  When I use the term \"Department of Health\", unless I specific otherwise, I refer to all health departments during the previous 30 to 40 years at the national and provincial level.  This will also include the health departments of the then independent and self-governing states and thus also by implication the various departments responsible for the budgeting and governance of the various homeland structures, such as the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Development, Cooperation or whatever name was used during the various phases of its history.  And the departments of health of the Tricameral system. I am, however, not speaking on behalf of the political functionaries who were the final decision and policy-makers.  \n The Department of Health was not a passive functionary only carrying out political orders. It was responsible for drafting and the practical implementation of the policies of the State, and that fragmented system of the past with provinces being quite autonomous and the various homeland governments being also autonomous this created the formula which allowed different interpretations of present policy in various areas.\n This period was marked by legislated racial discrimination, segregation and oppression, which not only affected the organisation of health services, but also the health of the people.\n Although the full consequences of the policy of apartheid were never anticipated nor acknowledged during the time when it was developed it is well researched and well documented.  In this submission I will briefly outline how the department acted as part of the apartheid apparatus leading to ill-health of millions and the unnecessary death of many South Africans.\n It is the responsibility of every person working in the health department today to ensure that never again will we allow practices and policies to be developed and implemented that will ignore or abuse the health and human rights of our people as it was in the case in the period under review.\n The health status of the population is a measure of more than just health services, poverty, employment, access to water, sanitation facilities and other socio-economic conditions are major determinants of health status in the country.  However, it is worth looking at the health status during the period under review as it reflects important patterns of health and health care which can be considered as violations of human rights.  Quite a number of speakers during the past two days have referred to various aspects of it.\n Through the period 1960 to 1994 the health situation in South Africa reveals two distinct patterns of disease and health status for Blacks and for Whites respectively.  Differences between the mainly Black rural areas and the urban areas are also stark.  White South Africans have had the infant mortality and life expectancy rate similar to countries in the developed world.  The figures for Blacks were similar to the underdeveloped world.  For the period 1965 to 1970 the life expectancy for African males was 51 and for females 60 years.  For Whites during that period the figures were 65 and 72 years respectively.  During 1985 the figures for African males was 55 and 61 compared to the 68 and 76 years respectively for Whites.  The life expectancy of the Indian and Coloured people fell between the White and the African figures.\n The following figures of estimates of infant mortality rate by population group and in rural areas in South Africa speaks for itself.  The IMF for South Africa during 1981 to 1985, excluding the TBVC countries was 94 to 124 for Africans, 51,9 for Coloureds, 17,9 for Indians and 12,3 for Whites. In the urban areas the situation was that the IMF for Africans was 38,6; for Coloureds 25,9; for Indians 17,1 and Whites 12,3.  While in the rural areas the figures for the African population was 100 to 135; for Coloureds 66; Indians 19,8 and for Whites 12,3.\n High incidence of kwashiorkor and marasmus have been extensively documented and clearly link the policies of the day to such - such as the Homeland system and the migrant labour system.  It was estimated in 1989 that there were 2,3 million people in South Africa, including the TBVC countries, who could be considered to be in need of nutritional assistance.  Of these 87% were African and 2% were White. Active nutrition support programmes, however, only started in the latter part of 1992. \n The disease patterns reflected major differences between the White and Black South Africans during that period.

            "Amongst Africans and Coloureds diseases such as tuberculosis, pneumonia, enteritis and other diarrhoeal diseases were the major causes of death.  In 1978 typhoid fever was 48 times more common amongst Blacks than Whites.  In 1971 deaths from diarrhoea were 100 times more common among Black children than White children in the Cape Town area.\n In 1987 African women had 3,5 times higher rates of cervical cancer than Whites.  The health system was, however, geared for disease patterns of the Whites who, for example, had higher levels of ischemic heart disease and diseases common in the western world.  On neither quality nor quantity of service can be completely correlated with the financial input.  It is certainly clear that without financial resources to provide adequate services health care will suffer.  \n The allocation of inequitable resources is probably the single most important factor for which the department can be held responsible, for that resulted in the inequities between the different areas in the country.  The per capital expenditure on health care ranged from, during 1985, for Africans, R115,00; for Coloureds R245,00; Indians R249,00 and for Whites R451,00.  During 1987 the figures were as follows.  For Africans R137,00; for Coloureds R340,00; for Indians R356,00 and for Whites R597,00.\n According to the Brown Commission in 1984/85 only 12% of the public health expenditure went to the Homelands where perhaps 40% of the population lived.\n I would like to refer now to the issues related to the health care of detainees.  Much has been said yesterday and today about the problems experienced by detainees, and rather than to repeat what was said I will confess that the way in which some of the staff of the Department of Health treated detainees and disposed of their roles as the watchdog of the health of the detainees was questionable to say the least.  And that as a result of that the health and human rights of many people were violated.  \n It was the duty of the district surgeon to record physical and mental signs of torture and abuse and to report these for the necessary action.  It appears from the evidence presented at this meeting that medical negligence was a factor in the deaths of a number of people in detention.  Many district surgeons were put in the invidious position of having to comply with the Prison Act and the Emergency Regulations and cooperate with the law enforcement authorities on the one hand, and the principles of their own medical ethics on the other hand. Most district surgeons appear to have opted for the former, either out of commitment to a political ideal or out of fear for not doing this.\n We have no evidence that doctors actively participated in torture, except one case that was mentioned yesterday, but nor did they expose torture when it was evident that it had occurred.  As the employer of district surgeons it is incumbent on the Department of Health to bear some responsibility for the fact that it created the mindset for the district surgeons to become accomplices to actions resulting in unnecessary illness and death.  However, it is important too, for the Department of Health to accept blame for not having taken sufficient action to enable district surgeons who wished to report on malpractices that became evident through their medical examination to do so without fear of victimisation.\n In the one case where a district surgeon did attempt to protect the rights of patients who were being tortured authorities in the Department of Health did not give their support and in fact even obstructed her.  \n Often youngsters and children were injured in clashes with the police.  When they went to the health services for care many were duly arrested either before or after initial treatment.  As result of this many people refused to go to the health services for treatment.  This resulted in the creation of community initiatives to care for the injured in clandestinely set up surgeries.  By not acting against such practices the Department of Health was in fact collaborating with the police services against the health interests of their patients.\n The Department of Health had little to protect the professional confidentiality and in fact collaborated with the police in producing information.   There are numerous reported incidents in which doctors, nurses and administrative staff were forced to give information, often with threats against the health worker or their family.  \n  Like in other forms of medical care psychiatrists and psychologists were faced with the dilemma of fixing a person up to be returned for further abuse.  In such situations the practitioner cannot withhold treatment in order to avoid being an accomplice to further interrogation or torture.  With patients needing psychiatric care the chance of a fairly rapid decline was probably higher than with most other illnesses.  The onus was on the practitioner to recommend that the person be discharged, or at least put into a slightly more normal situation than, for example, solitary confinement or isolation.\n When a number of patients were referred to a hospital to be treated for various conditions, some of which may have related directly to the detention and some of which were unrelated illnesses they were handcuffed to the bed to ensure that they did not escape.  This included patients sent for psychiatric care as well.  The now Premier of the North West, Pope Molefi is reported to have been kept in leg irons while being treated for a lung infection.\n The Security Police took action against many people who opposed the apartheid system and a list of health personnel who were detained and harassed during that time is available.\n The proposed new policy on medico-legal services in South Africa has been accepted by the PHRC and will now be submitted to the MINMEC meeting for consideration, and I think that this is a major breakthrough to move away from the kind of problems that have been discussed over the two days.\n Much of the family planning services of the department were directed at controlling the size of the Black population.  In 1981 the director general of this department warned that sterilisation and abortion might have to be made compulsory unless certain ethnic groups accepted family planning measures.  Fortunately this was not enforced.  This reflected the underlying motivation of government for the Department to allocate higher priority to family planning than to its primary health care services.\n The allegations of human rights abuses in South African psychiatric institutions came to a head around the mid-1970's following a number of newspaper articles which documented violations in the mainly State subsidised institution, the Smith-Mitchell Company.  There was also major concern internationally that South Africa, like the USSR was committing political dissenters to psychiatric institutions.\n During 1978 the American Psychiatric Association visited South Africa to investigate all the Smith-Mitchell Hospitals.  They were, however, not given the same access to State institutions. \n The following findings were recorded: \nAn unduly high death rate;\n Substandard care;\n Some instances of abuse practices;\n Grossly inadequate professional staff;\n Possible exploitation of patient labour; and\n Apartheid had destructive implications on the mental health of Black South Africans.\n The APA also found that treatment of Black patients were substantially worse than those of White patients.  They also made findings, such as, that patients were provided neither with toilet paper nor washbasins adjacent to toilet facilities.  Black patients, by policy, are not provided with sheets, and that the majority of Black patients answered in the affirmative to the question of whether they had been beaten or assaulted by staff.\n The then Department of Health found the APA report to be completely unacceptable and is rejected as prejudiced, biased and a masterpiece of malicious misinterpretation of facts.  We have no reason to believe that the APA had reason to misinterpret the facts.  This together with similar allegations contained in a 1996 investigation into psychiatric institutions led us to assert that most of the contents of this investigation were in fact true. The APA deserves an apology from the Department for, in essence, calling them liars.\n As with all health services emergency services, including ambulance services were separated by race.  Inevitably patients died because they were not given timeous treatment which they could have received had they not been of a different race group.  Because admission to hospitals was racially based patients were forced to go to hospitals which were not necessarily the nearest or the most accessible.  In terms of ambulances they were despatched to emergency situations based on race.  As a result if an ambulance serving the Black population group was in use a patient would have to wait rather than an ambulance reserved for Whites being despatched.\n The task team responsible for the development of a new emergency health care service policy has advanced fairly well and will be on - the coming Friday, will discuss the final policy document which will then, if accepted then, be submitted to the PHRC and the MINMEC for consideration.\n Personnel abuses:   Many hundreds of South Africans can justifiably blame the Department of Health for the fact that they were not given the opportunity to advance into a medical or related career.  While much of the blame for this must be borne by the Department of Education, for example, the Bantu Education and University Extension Act which essentially barred most Blacks from being educated as medical and related practitioners the Health Department must also carry some responsibility.  \n Under the Extension of University Education Act of 1995(?) non-White students were accepted into universities only with Ministerial permission.  During 1978 83% of Indian and 95% of Coloured applicants were granted permission while only 29% of African applicants were accepted, or were given permission.  Between 1986 and 1977 88% of all new doctors who were White and 3% were African.  The indignity of having to ask permission from a Minister to study was heartfelt by students.  \n The issue of discriminatory rules with regard to the training of Black students in White institutions were mentioned by a number of speakers and therefore I will not refer to it in any further detail.\n Other professional groups were similarly prejudiced in terms of admission and training.  The opening of the Medical University of South Africa was part of the grand apartheid plan which was aimed at having fewer Black doctors trained at White universities.  \n Despite equitable qualifications between White and Black personnel for most of the period under review discriminatory salaries were paid to Blacks.  This includes nurses and other professionals.  In addition facilities and conditions were separate and unequal.  Personnel working in the same facility and with the same qualification had separate toilets, separate tea rooms and separate accommodation.  \n Despite Black health personnel sometimes having better qualifications and experience White personnel were promoted above them.  It was seen as unacceptable to have Blacks in position of authority over Whites. Within the Department of Health no Black person had been appointed at director level or above until the new democratic dispensation.\n With minor exceptions women were also not appointed to senior management level.  The new human resource policy that deals effectively with these concerns is in its final stages of development.\n In accurate representations by the Department of Health:  We believe now that the Department of Health and other government departments were responsible for giving inaccurate and distorted perceptions of health and health care in South Africa.  These were often done deliberately to promote South Africa's standing in the world and for other propagandistic reasons.\n Conclusions:   Apartheid could not have existed without the apparatus which constituted it.  The Department of Health was one such apparatus.  In this historical overview of the health services over the past years it became quite clear that the Department of Health played a significant role in creating and maintaining apartheid.  In terms of human suffering this Department has much to answer for and much to apologise for.  \n Rather than allowing health to be the driving force of its policy this Department concentrated most of its efforts and resources on only part of the population in line with the political objectives of the apartheid state.\n The Department also became part of the oppressive apparatus of State by not taking stands and intervening when medical ethics were being violated even by their own employees.\n At a number of points in this submission we have suggested how the Department may have acted differently.  We make apologies to those discriminated against in terms of the poor or no health services resulting from the inequitable and racist allocation of resources. \n We make apologies to those detainees and their families who did not receive adequate health care, or who were abused by employees of this Department by commission or omission.\n We apologise as the Department of Health for not taking the actions necessary to ensure that such abuses did not occur and for not supporting those who did object to torture and other abuses of medical ethics.\n We apologise to those activists who were not protected by the Health Department and may have died or have permanent injury as a result. \n We apologise to the patients who have been violated at psychiatric institutions.  \n People who have suffered as a result of emergency services' practice along racial grounds.\n We apologise to people who would have wished to become part of the health personnel but were not allowed due to race.\n To practitioners who were discriminated against in terms of training, salaries, facilities and for acting against apartheid. Those who suffered as a result of this Department's policies.\n But before I conclude, I would also like to use this opportunity to thank the large numbers of dedicated health workers who have, on many occasions, worked long hours under sub-optimal conditions to fulfil the professional mission of a caring health service.\n As the Department of Health we will be doing all within our knowledge and power to ensure that the wrongs of the past are not repeated.  However, we would welcome any input from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to assist and guide us in creating a quality health care system.\n I thank you.",

            "Thank you Dr Pretorius.  I am going to approach this in somewhat the same way that I approached the SAMS.  The numerous questions that I have, and if I have to go through the questions we'll be here until tomorrow.  What I would like to recommend is that I go through the questions for the public record, where you want to comment very, very briefly, like one second, you may, but what I would like to do is to have you respond to these in writing, in fact some of these questions will require that you do some research.\n Thanks to the AAAS in reinforcing the way I've categorised the questions we somewhat agree about the broader range of issues, I've approached it from the perspective that as a national health service your primary responsibility is policy and accountability.  So there are four broad categories that I want to outline and then I'll go into the questions.\n The first one, which is exactly the same as the AAAS recommendation, is the issue of regulation and enforcement. And under regulation fall the issue of financing of services, organisation of services and even management of services.\n The second one is accountability which is a part of enforcement.  Under that comes monitoring.  How do you know in fact that the health services that are provided are of quality, they are accessible, all of those things?   And corrective measures under accountability, and that relates to the issue of the code of conduct of health professionals.\n The third one is capacity development which you allude to in your document very briefly.  I would like to know if the Department in fact has a grand plan, and we are talking here not only about the issue of redress but accessibility of services with the difficult populations like the elderly and in rural areas.  What is the Department's grand plan in capacity development.\n And the last one is the issue of education, and I've divided it into two.  The first one is education including skills development, that is the training of medical professionals.  The second one is re-education and rehabilitation, and that speaks to the issue of abuses beginning with district surgeons all the way through the system.\n Let me go through the questions and I think you have a preliminary copy of that.  I may have variations.\n The first one is,\n1. Could you briefly discuss whether there were specific national health policies which were formulated at the time which would account for the following in terms of differences, and I've only chosen four areas.  You've identified a whole lot in your document, but I just want to deal with four for the purpose of the record and then you can deal with the rest.\n The differences in life expectancy rates in South Africa.   Which means you are going to have to take all the populations.\n The second, infant mortality rates, particularly between Africans, Coloureds and Whites.\n The third one, urban - rural differences taking into consideration the fact that the poorest services are in rural areas and that's where the majority of older people, very poor people and children are.\n And finally under that question, diseases of the poor.  And in this case I've used malnutrition.  Not much has changed, the poor are still poor.  The poor still don't have running water.  The poor still don't have electricity.  The poor still don't have good sanitation.  \n And so we've got to address the diseases of the poor and I'm looking at the issue of health in the broader perspective not just as the absence of disease.\nThe second question is inspired by a section in your document and I'll quote\n\"In 1978 typhoid fever was 48 times more common among Blacks than Whites.  In 1971 deaths from diarrhoea were 100 times more common among Black children than White children particularly in the Cape Town area\".\n Could you examine policies which formed the bases for the allocation of health resources at the time, with specific focus on prevention strategies versus curative strategies for both Blacks and Whites.\n I mean we didn't just thumb-suck per capita expenditure something guided us in terms of the allocation of funding for services, and it is that something that I'd like you to go back to your legislative morgue so-to-speak and dig out those policies that guided these decisions.\nThe second question under that;\n What was the thinking on the part of the Department at the time toward health care policies specific to prevention services and who were the main beneficiaries?\n Again this was not just a thumb-suck, there was some thinking, somewhere in the Department and it's very important for us to know what that thinking is.\n I think it is wonderful to apologise but I think until we know the basis for these decisions it will be difficult for us to move forward.\nThe third question, I refer to page 4 of your submission under \"Resource distribution\", you note that, and I quote,\n\"The allocation of inequitable resources is probably the single most important factor for which the Department can be held responsible for past illness and death\".\n Again do you have a record of policies and procedures which provided the basis for the allocation of resources in the Department of Health?  And I'd like you to enlighten us on that.\n Fourth question, refer to page 6 of your document and I quote and I won't quote the whole sentence,\n\"The exact effects of segregation 'cannot be allowed to be repeated'.  The separation of health care facilities, particularly hospitals, was a nationwide practice with deleterious health effects especially on Blacks\".\n Would you please refer to policies which were the basis for such separation and how the Department proposes to address the still continuing inequities?\n Again this was not a thumb-suck in South Africa to separate facilities, something guided us, and I think it's important to go back to that something which guided us.\n5. Would you please give an overview of the 1984/85 Brown Commission Report focusing especially on its recommendations and the Department's follow-up of these recommendations.\n 6. Do you have a record of areas, and I'm talking about geographic areas, where district surgeons failed to perform their duties as outlined on page 7 of your submission?\n 7. Would you give us your thinking about underlying factors which contributed to the neglect of duty by district surgeons.\n Let me give you feedback, that it is of concern nationally that these very perpetrators or people who neglected duty, and I think we've Sectioned 30 Dr Lang for example, he is sighted all over, that he in fact has been returned to duty by the Department.  And a question that I have about this is how can we guarantee non-repetition of these practices, has Dr Lang and others gone through a rehabilitation process to ensure that such neglect does not continue?\n8. Again I refer to pages 8,9, what follow-up strategies have been undertaken to address the cases that you identify on pages 8 and 9 of your submission, particularly with respect to corrective measures?\n I think by apologising as a Department you are letting off the hook the real perpetrators, the Dr Lang's, it is very important that we get an accounting of this and how the Department plans to deal with it.  Dr Lang should not be allowed to continue to practice unless he's gone through a rehabilitation process.\n 9. Would you give an overview of the 1978/1982 regulations as highlighted on page 10, I think they are important.  What is the current status of these regulations?  And comment on whether these regulations are sufficient to address recurring problems.\n 10. Refer to page 11, the last paragraph, what provisions has the Department made to follow up on the many people who were tortured and injured in other ways throughout the struggle, particularly those who were physically and emotionally disabled as a result?\n Has the Department investigated the effects of the violations, particularly the long-term effects?\n Are these patients receiving treatment?  Actually let me call them persons because I don't know if they are receiving any treatment.\n If the Department has not done any follow-up how then can we be certain that their health problems will be addressed?\n I am acknowledging that the Department has more pressing priorities, but I would like the Department to deal with that.\n11. Clearly access, both financial and geographic is an important aspect of health care, would you please address the issues raised on, and I quote, \"Independent panel of doctors\" on page 12, and the comments you make on the last paragraph.\n And as I am talking about the issue of access earlier in your document you sight the figures for the four population groups in terms of per capita expenditure for health and you sight the African figure as 137,  I would like to correct that and suggest that I don't think you factored in the fact that the hospitals were located at a distance and for Africans they had to have transportation to get there and so the figure is much lower.  And so when you recalculate please take that into consideration.\n12. Page 15, and I quote,\n \"The Department did not provide guidelines for such situations.....\"\n which you identify on page 15, could you comment further on this especially on whether the Department has since addressed this issue which is crucial?\n 13. We know that certain family planning practices, for example, the case of depo provera were forced on Black women.  These practices we know have long term effects.  Have studies been done in South Africa, particularly by the Department to follow-up on these women, especially with respect to long term infertility and cancer?\n 14. Comment specifically on the abuse of patients, including what seemed like condonation of this behaviour by other ministries.  You allude to it, wetting our appetite, but you don't go into it.  You see we want to see how other ministries colluded with the Department in these practices.\n 15. Review of human rights violations in psychiatric institutions, what is the current status of the conditions in psychiatric institutions?  I know that you referred to a study.\n 16. What is the status of the plan tabled by the current Department for ensuring non-repetition of abuses in psychiatric institutions?\n 17. Under emergency services we used to joke about it and say if you are Black don't you dare have an accident in a White area, now of course Whites were safe they couldn't have accidents in Black areas, but in order to survive we joked about it, we would like to know the way forward specific to what you address on inequitable access to emergency services.\n 18. And then you talk about capacity development briefly.  It is important to address the issue of capacity development in the medical and health professionals broadly, including physicians, nurses, allied health professions etc.  \n Does the Department have a grand plan, especially to assess issues related to access to Black areas and to rural areas, the more difficult areas of health need?\n 19. And on the issue of misinformation you very honestly outline the areas of misinformation, particularly to the international community about the health status in South Africa.\n What are the proposed strategies, first, to correct his misinformation?  And further to deal with the issues of inequity that are still persisting and how the nation gets to know about them?\n 20. There is a question that I have received from one of my panel and it says,\n Our research indicates that until the 1940's South African mental hospitals were under the Departmental of Prisons, do you think locating mental health within the Department of Health has made a difference in terms of patient care?  If so in what way?\n 21. My last question, that is the way forward from the broader perspective, but specific to three issues:\n The first issue is the treatment of people in correctional institutions and the treatment of detainees.\n And the Department's role in involvement with the TRC, but with other more permanent structures, that will go on after the TRC, in formulating issues related to rehabilitation policy.  \n I sent you our document, I hope you received it, which really clearly categorises our findings of what was presented to us in terms of medical problems, emotional problems and other problems that are related.  We would like to involve the Department in re-working that framework so that when the TRC leaves at least the Department can be left to address those issues.\n Finally, what is the Department's strategy to ensure a culture of human rights within the broader health sector community?\n I think what is even more important is that the Department has to institute corrective measures, because it is devastating for people in the community when they see the same district surgeons who perpetrated abuses continuing in the same positions.  What is the Department doing about that?  We are not suggesting that we get rid of those people, I mean that would have been my preference but I am only an individual, what I am suggesting are corrective measures which would include education and rehabilitation.\n Thank you.  Do you have any comments or lack of clarity on this?",

            "Yes Madam Chair I would gladly deal with the questions asked by the Commission and supply the information as is available, although one realises it might be difficult to get it out of the fragmented system and a lot of that has disappeared, but nevertheless we will try and provide what is available and put it into the necessary context.\n I think it's also in the report that I have given was during the period prior to our elections, but if we do not get an opportunity to unpack what has been done subsequently in terms of the restructuring of the entire system, the development of new policies and pieces of legislation, that comes out of the considerations and the experience from the people whom we have heard were part of those that were disadvantaged and affected by the system.  So that we have a lot already that we can be proud of, but we are not complacent about that.  But the picture is a bit distorted and even the composition of our panel that the structure of the Department, the changes that took place there is well known in terms of gender issues as well as the issue, racial representation.  \n And that presently we are operating in the Department getting the input and the benefit and contribution and the value added from all of the people present in the Department.  And that I must say it is nice working in a Department where there is so much openness and honesty as well as criticism.  A lot of what's been done comes out of the bottom drawers of people working in the system but it was put on the table and what was good was accepted and what was not good was taken away.  So it's a process of contribution and if you've got something to add and you can justify and you've got the facts to prove it it's accepted.  If it's not accepted it's thrown out.  Melvyn!",

            "I think my comments are very similar.  A white paper has just come out from the Health Department in which the whole restructuring of the Department is contained.  There are also a number of policies which have either been accepted or are in the process of being accepted through various structures for the transformation of the health sector and I think that they need to be read to see the kind of movement that is happening in the Health Department and yes, as Dr Pretorius said, we were reflecting on a specific period which we were asked to comment on.\n The second thing that I wanted to say is that we can develop some of these guidelines and frameworks for what to do with district surgeons or whether we should go back to the past or just look to the future, but I think our intention has always been that we would like to do it together with the Truth Commission so that it shouldn't be us going back, doing it, coming to you and then comparing notes.  I think that we would rather like to look at the issues together and see where we should be going, and I think that's why the next session is so important for us.   I think this is a bit overwhelming for us to have all these questions bombarded at us, and I think that I personally take some exception to being equated with the submission from the Medical Services last night because I think that we really have attempted to examine that past and to look at what has gone wrong and to apologise where we have seen that things have gone wrong.

For us these questions are serious, especially when dealing with the public structures like ministries.  Some of the questions, we live with this contradiction all the time.  When we meet with representatives of ministries we get this message that we have done so well, we have these grand plans on our table, but at the same time, at this point in time we have got about 10,000 statements, people who have come forward who really we have nowhere to refer.  A significant number of people have died who have come before the Commission who couldn't get help because they are living in areas where the quality of health care is still disgusting.   When it comes to mental health care it's difficult to describe what we are faced with on a daily basis.  We have met with MEC's, we run around looking at the percentage of the crippled nation that is living with us up to today.  So much as we accept that ministries have come up with grand plans, but the reality that we are confronted with on a daily basis it talks to the opposite.\n So in thanking you I will really appreciate and thank you for making a commitment, and we will appreciate to get the responses to the questions that have been raised and to continue a dialogue.

From the South African Pharmacy Council and from the University of Zululand.  All of them say something similar to this.\n\"Be assured of our full commitment to helping and healing of all concerned in this process and the prevention of human rights abuses in the future\".\nAnd also many people congratulate us on having a hearing which focuses on the health sector.\n Thank you very much.",

But I think this all just demonstrates that the issue of health and human rights is not only a national one, it's an international one and the process which we are going through together is one of immense importance.\n Before I move on to thank all the people who have made this hearing possible I want to underline the importance of the meeting which is going to follow which is going to be chaired by Dr London.\n We have to acknowledge that there are certain things which the Truth Commission is authorised and mandated to do and other things which it cannot do, and I think the time has now come for us to say that the health profession must decide what needs to be done about the issue of health and human rights.  The Truth and Reconciliation Commission is certainly prepared to assist and facilitate and give whatever input we can, but as Mapule said our shelf-life ends on the 15th of December 1997, health and human rights issues will remain a concern for decades to come.  \n So I do ask that as many of you as possible do stay for the plenary meeting which is going to follow immediately after I have done the wedding reception thing of saying thank you to everybody.  I always feel that everyone switches off at this stage, but it's really very important because these people have all made a tremendous contribution towards these hearings.\n At the workshop in November last year we elected a task team whose primary task was to ensure that these hearings occurred and they have worked tirelessly for the last however many months, seven months, meeting regularly, spurring people on to make submissions, making submissions themselves and I would just like to name them.  The membership has been a bit of a moving goalpost but the hard core group, as it were, consists of David Green, Leslie London, Donald Skinner, Rachel Prinsloo, Gavin Dampster, Sheila Clow, we had a representative from the Progressive Primary Health Care Network who tended to change from meeting to meeting, and latterly three researchers joined us, Laurel Baldwin from the Health and Human Rights Project; Sheila Roquitte, who is a research intern here at the TRC and Lionel Nicholas, who was asked by PsySSA to help them with their submission and who actually presented their submission.  This group, without a doubt, has made the last two days possible and I personally want to thank them for the practical and the emotional and spiritual support that they gave me as I worked towards these hearings.\n I want to thank the TRC staff who have worked, Thulani and Wilhelm who have been here, but who aren't here now, for the past two days, who are going to help us in pulling the proceedings together and documenting them;  our logistics officers Gayle and Elizabeth;  Linda van Demen my secretary who has dealt with mountains of correspondence and faxes and submissions and Martila Naidoo who is our support services manager in this office.  \n Thanks to the South African Police Services who provided security. I think they have been quite unobtrusive but I can assure you they were here every morning at 7:30 with their sniffer dogs making sure that these premises were safe.  \n The translators who have a very difficult job.  I think simultaneous translation is one of the most difficult things to do and they always somehow need to manage.\n And then to my fellow panellists who have also worked very hard in going through the submissions allocated to them and in compiling questions.  Thank you very much.\n Today is the end of one process and the beginning of another, and I look forward to seeing that process through with very many of the people who are in this room and many who aren't in this room as well.

In pursuance of \nwhat Mr Bizos said, I suggested to the Committee that we will \nhave it transcribed, and this developed subsequent to the \nadjournment period.\n\tMembers of the Committee, we have already submitted \nheads of argument and subsequently heads of argument have been \nreceived from the members of the family.  These heads were \nreceived on the Thursday and unfortunately they were received \nlate.  Mr Bizos had other obligations, but we will leave it at that.\n\tHonourable Chairperson, our heads have been discussed \nthoroughly under various topics.   I would like to refer to a \nnumber of aspects with reference to the testimony and in light of \nthe fact that further new evidence was submitted, since the \nsubmission of the heads, and if preferred as such, we could submit \nwritten heads of argument in response to Mr Bizos' heads of \nargument to the Committee.\n\tI would like to argue with respect that the applicants firstly \ncomplies with the provisions of the relevant Section 21(c) and \nwith specific reference to the applicant's action in support of the \nConservative Party, that he believed on a bona fide basis that he \nwas supporting the cause of the Conservative Party.  With \nreference to the aspect of his actions in support of the \nConservative Party, I refer you to the judgment of the S v Maloi \nand others in SA Court Reports, 1987 1 (196) (A), judgment of \nPresiding Appeal Court, Judge Boshoff, and specifically on page \n210, H - I and also on page 211, and 212 H - I.\n\tWith respect in this respect, I would like to argue that in \nthat judgment it was necessary that the party had to have been \naware of the actions which were undertaken by the applicants.\n\tIt is my argument that under these circumstances the \napplicant who was an Executive Member of the Consecutive \nParty, acted in support of the Party.  There is no evidence to the \ncontrary which supports that the applicant acted maliciously or \nacted in any way for his own interests or to promote his own \ninterests.\n\tThe Committee with respect, should consider what the \npolitical history of the country was, which preceded all these \nevents, where the country was governed by a white government, \nwhich consisted of the National Party, later the Conservative \nParty and the National Party which devolved by following a \ndifferent policy and had a vision of a unity State and the \nConservative Party's vision was that of separate development and \neach nation governing itself.\n\tThis was the strong policy of the Conservative Party which \nwas not negotiable according to them, and in short, it took place \nthat the party according to the evidence of Dr Hartzenberg, the \nleader of the Conservative Party, that the democratic process at a \nstage, was closed and that negotiations would serve no further \npurpose and that according to the evidence of Mr Derby-Lewis, \nthe Codesa negotiations were overwhelmed or dominated by \nmembers of the Communist Party and as seen by the Conservative \nParty, communist rule was at the order of the day and with \nrespect, this fact was a fact according to the people and the party \nwho believed that there was a threat which was eminent and that \nthere was no other option but to mobilise on all fronts, there was \ntalk of war.\n\tThere was a climate of war.  Yesterday evidence was given \nabout it again, Visser and Clark, Dr Hartzenberg have all testified \nin terms of this, the applicants have testified in terms of this, and \nat this stage there are applications for amnesty which indicate or \nwhich go as far as May 1994.\n\tI would like to argue with respect that it was not indicated \nto the contrary that it could be said that there was no state of \nundeclared war.",

This is \nsupported by the fact that this was the purpose of Captain de \nWaal.\n\tCaptain de Waal's evidence was unacceptable when he said \nthat Colonel Van Niekerk told him that a team, apart from the \nSecurity Police, would blindly question a person without knowing \nanything about the matters of that case, things which he already \ntold Deetliefs.\n\tTaking into consideration that she had mentioned certain \nthings to Deetliefs, which is available on video tapes, you can \nhave a look at that, and then he also said that she wrote a \nstatement in her own handwriting, and then she is told that what \nyou have just said now, according to information, is not true.\n\tYour husband said something else.  If you have a look at \nthat and you look at her handwritten statement, volume R4, just \none minute please, specifically regarding the firearm and the list \nMr Kemp provided, if you look at the statement of Captain de \nWaal in Exhibit AC page 2 where he says at the bottom regarding \nthings which are unclear and there are things which do not \ncoincide with her husband's statement.  In other words he knew \nwhat Deetliefs had said and he said he did not know.  \n\tFurthermore he said she stated that her husband never \nindicated a firearm, while her husband during questioning did \nindicate a firearm.  She went further, saying that she now \nremembered.\n\tIf we look at the statement, her handwritten statement, \nparagraph 66 on page 158 of the typed version, it's page 159, \nparagraph 72\n\t\t\"then that Cuba had possibly done the deed and Clive \nand I later confirmed that Cuba had used the gun \nwhich Clive showed me one day in the house (with a \nsilencer).  Clive and I then left.  We were both of \ncourse shocked at the news and then we went \nshopping\"\nIf you look at the handwritten document at page 66, paragraph \n72, you will see where it all fits in.  Not on the bottom part of the \npage, two thirds down the page.  There it's written \n\t\t\"It was obvious to me\"\nthat's what is written there.  It's very clear that she had written \nsomething else, where's that page?  There's more written on this \npage, it's evident here that she had written more on this page.  It \nis very clear that she had to re-write this and had to fit this into \nthis page. \n\tIf you look at the time when he questioned her on the 26th \nof April she had already completed her statement to fit it into \nthis.

            "That's correct Mr Chairman.  Just a moment \nplease.  If you take into consideration that Mrs Derby-Lewis, \ninitially during her incarceration while she was questioned by \nDeetliefs before she was under Section 29 but she did not have \nlegal representation, under each question she said\n\t\t\"No answer, no comment.\"\nafter that she was under Section 29 and van Niekerk said\n\t\t\"She had to talk.\"\n\tMr Chairman, then I want to submit that these statements of \nhers do not have any value for the Committee to use it against the \napplicant because they were taken under those circumstances.  \nWith respect Mr Chairman, this Committee is aware of what \nSection 29 entailed.  Today there is evidence of how people were \nhandled to get the necessary information.  Today it's not a law \nanymore and today it could even be claimed to be \nunconstitutional.  \n\tThere was an instance, I don't have the Judgment, where in \na Civil Case they wanted to present a statement in a case of a \nwitness being held under Section 29 and it was argued that that \nSection was unconstitutional and it could not be relied on because \nof that.  This also makes sense in this regard.\n\tMr Chairman, if you look at the statement taken or made by \nMr Derby-Lewis and under the circumstances - firstly on the \nvideo recording, I think it's video recording number 3, it is \nclearly indicated how Mr Derby-Lewis begged Mr Deetliefs that \nhe needed a legal representative and he said he could not make a \nstatement under those circumstances.  You could see on that \nvideo recording, it speaks for itself how he acted under those \ncircumstances and Mr Derby-Lewis afterwards, how he was \nbroken down and then he made a statement.  \n\tWhat is the value then of a statement made under those \ncircumstances and furthermore where he is told\n\t\t\"We are going to lock up your wife.\"\nHe said he was protecting his wife and that was just natural, \nwhile he knew that that list which was used was a list presented \nto his wife by Arthur Kemp.  That was a list from him to her and \nthat had a certain connection with his wife.  With respect, it was \njust a natural thing to protect his wife.\n\tIn his evidence he told us how he obtained the list.  He said \nhe saw the list in Cape Town, he described the circumstances.  \nDoctor Hartzenberg supports the fact that documents were placed \non his desk by Mrs Derby-Lewis, he supports her evidence.  There \nis no reason why Doctor Hartzenberg would tell a lie about \nsomething like that.\n\tAnd shortly Mr Chairman without using anymore of your \ntime, these statements have little if no value at all, these \nstatements which were taken under Section 29.  And the \nCommittee should rely on the evidence provided by Mrs Derby-\nLewis in this regard. \n\tMr Chairman, the evidence regarding the list.  We \nunderstand from the family that it is alleged that there was a big \nconspiracy, that apart from these two applicants it's also alleged \nthat Mrs Derby-Lewis - and also regarding the way in which the \nfirearm was obtained - I've already referred to du Randt and Mrs \nVenter, Mr Venter's evidence was that Mr Derby-Lewis asked for \na weapon for stockpiling. \n\tWith respect, under the circumstances there is no evidence \nto the contrary and why would he tell Mr Venter that he was \ngoing to murder somebody with that weapon and then broaden a \nconspiracy which would have been unprofessional to do, to \ncommit such a deed.  \n\tThe same applies for Mr du Randt.  And it seems from his \nstatement made to the police, that he is innocent.  Mr Derby-\nLewis could not tell him anything, he was in custody.  He could \nnot tell Venter because he was in custody.  Mr Venter acted on \nhis own behalf.  \n\tRegarding Mr Kemp, during the trial and receiving further \nparticulars the State said that Mr Kemp was not a co-conspirator. \n In the Court Judge Eloff also treated him likewise.  Mr \nChairman, this list with 19 names was faxed to Mr Kemp from \nMrs Derby-Lewis, it was an open fax line.  At that time, and it's \nno secret, telephones were tapped and faxes were intercepted so \nsomebody would have been stupid, if it was a secret, to convey it \nin such a manner.\n\tShe leaves those 19 names on her computer and the police \nhad access to that computer.  She knew then that on the 12th of \nApril that list would become involved and that would be damning \nevidence.  If she - why would she then leave that list on the \ncomputer, Mr Walus had already been arrested and there was a lot \nof fuss in the media?\n\tHonourable Chairman, Mrs Derby-Lewis was found innocent \nduring the trial, why would she now here, she has no reason now \nto come and say \"I was not a co-conspirator\", there's nothing for \nher to lose.  If she comes here and says she was a co-conspirator \nshe could have made an amnesty application, she knew her \nhusband was applying for amnesty for perjury or anything like \nthat.  She does not apply for amnesty because she believes she \nwas not a co-conspirator.  \n\tIf you look at these statements written by the police, they \nwant to involve her, those parts which were put in.   And in the \nend it looks as if for the police that later on she could have heard \nabout these things but she did not know it in the planning stages \nwhile planning an assassination.\n\tWith respect Mr Chairman, Arthur Kemp was the author of \nthis list, he is the person who decided about this list.  That was \nhis evidence in the Supreme Court,  he compiled this list, she had \nno control over that.  And right from the beginning she said she \nrequired that list in order to obtain information to write certain \nthings in the Patriot and a lot has been said about that.\n\tWith respect, look at the list itself.  Should it be a murder \nlist one would have expected that there would have been full \nparticulars.  For example regarding Mr Chris Hani, all you find \nthere is an address that says nothing, it's insignificant.  It can't be \nregarded as a murder list.  ...[intervention]",

            "Then I would like to deal with Section \n22(a) which I would present to the Committee.  This is the \nsection which reads that the offence for which the applicant is \napplying should be a deed which is related a political objective.  \n\tI would like to present to the Honourable Committee that \nthe applicant was a member of the Conservative Party.  It is \nargued that after the deed the Conservative Party apparently said \nin the media that he was not a member of the Conservative Party. \n I would like to argue to you that that indeed was his testimony.  \nMr Hartzenberg testified and he made no mention that he was not \na member of the Conservative Party.\n\tThe applicant presented his background, his birth in Poland \nto the Committee and his experience of the Communist Party.   I \nwould like to present to the Committee that his background in \nPoland and his experience of the Communist Party was not \npresented to the Committee in order to say that he had developed \na hatred towards Communists on that basis and that is why the \ndeed was committed, but if one studies his testimony it is not \nindicated in any other way.  He did this in order to say to the \nCommittee that he knew what would happen if the country would \nbe ruled by a communist dispensation.\n\tThe applicant immigrated to South Africa and because he \ncame to South Africa he became involved in politics, although at \nthat stage he was not a citizen of our country and could not \nparticipate in elections.  From the initial stages he realised that \nchanges were taking place in the country and he became closely \ninvolved with the Conservative Party's breaking away.  \n\tAt that point he was quite aware of South African politics \nand he realised, as it is set out, that the policy which prevailed at \nthat point was about change and that there might be a possible \ncommunist dispensation in government.\n\tHe met Mr and Mrs Derby-Lewis during 1995 and became \nfurther involved in politics and assisted the Conservative Party \nwith elections and by-elections.  And after he was granted \ncitizenship in 1988, before that time in 1985 he also became a \nmember of the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging and when he was \ngranted citizenship in 1989 he participated in his first election in \nSouth Africa.\n\tHe also testified that he realised in 1990, when the \nANC/SACP was legalised, that there was a definite problem which \nwas developing in South Africa and he believed that there would \nbe  an ANC/SACP rule in the government.\n\tHe was also present when Dr Andries Treurnicht delivered a \nspeech at the Voortrekker Monument in May 1990 where the third \nstruggle for freedom was mentioned.  And he testified that during \nthat meeting Dr Andries Treurnicht swept or called the masses of \npeople who attended the meeting, called them to battle.  And \nafter that he attended negotiations where the Conservative Party \ndecided that they should ready themselves for a possible war.\n\tIn 1992 he was also further involved, and he testified \nregarding that, he was involved in the referendum which was to \ntake place and it was decided afterwards that the democratic road \nwas most definitely for the Afrikaner, as definitely closed for the \nAfrikaner nation of which he regarded himself to be a member.\n\tThe applicant who was involved in politics as I have just \nargued, was more involved with the second applicant, Mr Clive \nDerby-Lewis, and his politics. What appears very strongly within \nhis testimony is that he as an immigrant from Poland.  He came to \nbe under the influence of Mr Clive Derby-Lewis, that he regarded \nhim as a political leader and not just a politician and he also \nregarded him as one of the policy makers of the Conservative \nParty.\n\tAfter the referendum in 1992 it was very clear to the \napplicant that the CP and the other right-wing groups - and I wish \n to argue that it should be considered that he was also involved in \nAWB meetings.  AWB was one of the right-wing groups and the \nAWB was not and is not a political party.  The members of the CP \nbelonged to the CP as a political party and to the AWB as a right-\nwing organisation.  It is not to say that the members of the AWB \ncould not have been Conservative Party members.\n\tDr Ferdie Hartzenberg testified - and I'm still dealing with \nthis under the fact that this offence occurred within a political \nstruggle as Section 22(a) determines, Dr Ferdie Hartzenburg \ntestified that it was not the policy of the CP, the written policy \nwhich they as a political party expressed or carried out.  Violence \nwas not their policy.\n\tHowever Dr Ferdie Hartzenberg's testimony must be seen \nvery thoroughly as an entirety.  He testified that during \nAugust/September 1992, after the signing of the Record of \nUnderstanding that was between the National Party and the ANC, \nthe CP realised that it was now involved in a political struggle. \n\tUp until that point the CP had achieved quite a level of \nsupport in politics.  They won a number of by-elections and it \nbecame very clear that the Conservative Party which at that point \nhad already become the opposition, if there were to be a general \nelection the voters - that would be before it was an open election \nfor all population groups, the CP realised that it might able to \ndefeat the National Party.  But with the undersigning of the \nRecord of Understanding the CP realised, and this was made clear \nfrom every platform from their supporters, that now there was an \noverwhelming struggle and that the Afrikaner nation's freedom \nwas in danger because if the ANC/SACP Alliance came into \npower, the Afrikaner nation would lose it's freedom.\n\tAnd the policy - this is his testimony, the CP's policy was \nto strive for the freedom of the Afrikaner nation and it did not \nchange since the establishment of the Conservative Party.  Now \nwith the signing of the Record of Understanding, this freedom of \nthe Afrikaner was put in danger and that is how the CP regarded \nit and it was also expressed as such.\n\tHe also testified that it was very clear to the Conservative \nParty that the ANC and especially the SACP under the leadership \nof Mr Chris Hani would not grant the Afrikaner nation it's own \nterritory, they wanted a unity state.  And he also testified about \nan army which Mr Hani had ready, with 10 000 troops if the vote \ndid not swing in favour of the ANC and the negotiations for the \nunity state would be enforced with violence.\n\tThe testimony of Dr Hartzenberg continued and said that as \na result of this political struggle which existed or ruled the \ncountry at that point - it cannot be seen as anything else, the CP \ndecided to mobilise in all areas, not only religiously or in the \neducational sphere, on all levels.\n\tThe CP mobilised to resist the ANC/SACP Alliance in terms \nof the threat towards the Afrikaner nation.",

I've already indicated to you that he said that Mr Hani \nwas regarded as enemy number one of the Afrikaner people and if \nHani should be in control of the country the Afrikaner people \nwould be destroyed.\n\tAnd then I want to come back to what Mr Potgieter has \nsaid.  The policy of the Conservative Party was to ensure the \nfreedom of the Afrikaner people and if Mr Hani, if he was in \ncontrol of the country, then the Conservative Party believed that \nthe Afrikaner people's liberty would be destroyed.  Then, as a \nresult of that point of view of the CP and the right-right, the \nright-wing together with the CP because they were part of the \nCP, then they became involved in a political struggle and then \nthey propagated violence. \n\tThe Conservative Party and Mr Hartzenberg cannot get \naway from that fact.  Their followers heard about violence and \nthat they had to use to protect their liberty.\n\tIt was also clear from his evidence that the political \nstruggle was, and he said \"The National Party betrayed the \nAfrikaner people and the struggle after the legalisation of the \nANC/SACP and the struggle was then against those \norganisations\".\n\tMr Chairman, in my heads I also referred to 22(d) and I \nwant to submit that in order to qualify for amnesty, the applicant \nhe had to make full disclosure of the offence and according to \nwhich - this article, he is applying for amnesty.\n\tA lot has been said about the fact that there was wider \nconspiracy than only that between these two applicants and then \nbecause of the application there was not full disclosure.  I want \nto put it to you that the applicant's evidence indicates that at the \nend of 1992  he was in Europe and after his return in December \n1992 he made contact with Mr Clive Derby-Lewis.  \n\tBefore he had left for Europe this struggle in the country \nwas already going on and when he returned in December this \npolitical situation in the country was discussed further.\n\tHis evidence is, and there's no other evidence contradicting \nthat, that at that stage the political situation in the country was \ndiscussed and not at any stage that they then decided that \nanybody had to be eliminated.\n\tIn February 1993, the applicants visited Mr Clive Derby-\nLewis again and then received the instruction and the planning \nwas made to murder Mr Hani.  It is evident from the first \napplicant's evidence that Mr Derby-Lewis provided a list to him.  \n I want to argue that should the Committee find that Mrs Derby-\nLewis, based on her statements based on Section 29, as Ngoepe \npointed out to Mr Prinsloo, if the Committee finds that Mrs \nDerby-Lewis knew beforehand that there was planning being done \nto murder Mr Hani, I want to submit that the applicant, Mr \nWalus, had no knowledge of this whatsoever.   He did not know \nthat which Mrs Derby-Lewis knew, there is no indication.\n\tEven in the Section 29 statements or any other evidence, \nthere is any indication that Mr Walus knew that Mrs Derby-Lewis \nknew what her husband - Mr Walus did not have any knowledge \nthat he discussed it with her.",

            "Thank you.\n\tI finished on page 14.  The applicant undertook to execute \nthe elimination of Mr Hani on his own and on that very same day \nwhen the order was given to him he requested of Mr Clive Derby-\nLewis to issue him an unlicensed firearm.  They also discussed it \nand it was decided that Mr Hani's home would be reconnoitred \nand early in March 1993 they reconnoitred the home of Mr Hani a \nnumber of times in order to establish the routine and movements \nof the home.  \n\tOn the 6th of April 1993, he visited Mr Derby-Lewis at his \nhome after an invitation from Mr Derby-Lewis to have breakfast \nthere that morning.  On that day the unlicensed firearm was \nhanded over to Mr Walus.  There was a discussion which involved \nthat Mr Derby-Lewis would provide him with further ammunition \nand the silencer which was fitted to the firearm could not be used \nwith regular ammunition.\n\tOn the 7th of April, Mr Walus once again contacted Mr \nDerby-Lewis or visited him in order to determine whether any \nchanges had been made to the plans and whether he had managed \nto gain ammunition for him.  At that point he had not received \nany ammunition.  According to Mr Walus' testimony the only \nfurther suggestion which was made to him was that the \nelimination be undertaken before the Easter weekend.\n\tOn the 10th of April a Saturday, Mr Walus went, not with \nthe purpose to shoot Mr Hani on that specific day, according to \nhis testimony, he went for his regular exercise at a certain sports \ncentre.  Thereafter he decided or the place or facility was closed \nbecause it was a public holiday and he decided that he would do \nfurther reconnaissance.  He had tested the weapon on his \nbrother's small holding and found that the silencer could not fire \nautomatically.\n\tHe then decided that he would buy ammunition with his own \nfirearm licence which would be the same ammunition as for the \nunlicensed weapon.  He took a drive to go and do further \nreconnaissance at Mr Hani's home.  From the testimony of Mr \nWalus you can see that it concurs with the testimony given in the \nSupreme Court.  And on that day he saw Mr Hani in front of his \nhouse where he was climbing into his vehicle and there were no \nbodyguards present.\n\tInitially he thought that it was Mr Hani but he wanted to \nmake certain and he drove along behind the vehicle until it came \nto a shopping centre where Mr Hani\nclimbed out of the vehicle and was positively identified as Mr \nHani.  Thereafter when Mr Hani departed, he took another road \nand stopped behind Mr Hani's vehicle whereupon he climbed out, \ncalled out his name, Mr Hani reacted to that, he turned around \nand Mr Walus shot Mr Hani.  He shot him four times.\n\tThereafter he departed and from the Court case his vehicle \nwas identified by Mrs Harmse and Mr Walus was arrested shortly \nafter the events.  \n\tIn terms of Section 21(c), that is on page 21, it is clear that \nit is required by law that the applicant provide a full disclosure of \nall the relevant facts regarding the events.  If there are certain \nsmall issues which might not have any bearing matters which were \nemphasised during the hearing, especially with regard to Mr \nWalus and his actions, his brother dead after the glass works were \ndeclared insolvent, these details are of minor import and not \nrelevant.\n\tI would like to submit to the Honourable Committee that \nthe applicant has made a full disclosure of all the relevant facts \nand the legal counsel of the family and the SACP have submitted \nthe statements before the Committee. And the so-called \nstatements which Mr Walus would have made to Captain Deetliefs \nand with the intention of the submission of these statements to \nthe Committee, the intention is to make it clear that there are \nfacts which the applicant did not disclose and there is a greater \nconspiracy.  \n\tThe applicant was arrested and detained in the Benoni \npolice cells and it would appear quite clearly from the \ndocumentation that he did not want to make any statement unless \nhe had legal representation.  He was taken from the cells by \nvarious police officers and interviewed or questioned by various \npolice officers until, on the 14th of April 1993, he fell into the \nhands of Captain Deetliefs.  \n\tHe was once again taken out to his residence by Captain \nDeetliefs, taken back to his cell and on that day, the 14th of April \nthe applicant said to Captain Deetliefs that he would like use his \nright to silence and did not wish to make any statements unless \nhis legal representative was present.\n\tOn the 15th of April 1993 until early morning hours of the \n16th of April, the applicant the applicant was questioned for 11 \nhours and according to Captain Deetliefs notes were taken which \nare not available.  No statement was taken from the applicant on \nthat particular evening.  \n\tIn the early morning hours the applicant was placed back in \nhis cells, that is on the 16th at twenty past five.  That very same \nafternoon, at 16H05 he was once again taken out of the cell and \nonce again questioned for approximately 14 hours and yet again \nnotes were not taken and no statement was taken either.  \n\tThe early morning hours of 16 April 1993, approximately \n04H15 that morning the applicant began, according to Mr \nDeetliefs, to cooperate.  That is so, the applicant has confirmed \nthis.  The applicant confirmed that he cooperated as a result of \nthe fact that Captain Deetliefs caught him or tricked him and by \nmeans of lies he led him to believe, this is Deetliefs, that he had \ninfiltrated the security police, that they were actually cooperating \nwith Tienie Groenewaldt and that if he would cooperate it could \nresult that Mr Holmes, who was the investigating officer in this \ncase at that time, would not make any further arrests and that \nDeetliefs was actually working for the right-wingers.\n\tThe applicant in his testimony stated that he was extremely \nnaive and he realised this later, it was naive of him to believe \nCaptain Deetliefs.  The only notes which are available from this \nquestioning, from which point on the applicant would have been \ncooperating, would the hand-written notes - just a moment please, \npage 84, 85 and 86, that would be in R4.\n\tThere are the only notes from all these hours of questioning \nwhich were provided by Captain Deetliefs and can be provided.  If \nthe video cassettes are watched it is logical that there wouldn't be \nany notes, however in Captain Deetliefs' statement which is to be \nfound in R4 continued he at several points mentions that notes \nwere taken down by Mr Beetge.  \n\tThat cannot be so because he could not make a statement to \nthe Attorney General of the Witwatersrand, Mr Klaus von Leerus \nat that time, in which he would state, in terms of everything that \nhad happened, that he was infiltrating the police and working \nalong with Tinnie Groenewaldt and that is why there weren't any \nnotes.  But what is shocking is that he says on numerous times in \nhis statement that notes were taken.\n\tThese are the only notes ...[intervention]",

That was \nconfirmed.  One can also see on one of the video cassettes that he \nis drinking beer.  The applicant said that he could have been given \nsedatives because the alcohol effected him quite severely.  \n\tBut the most important aspect is that Captain Deetliefs \ntricked the applicant with his lies.  The applicant then provided \nthese details as appears in the hand-written documents but the \napplicant testifies that Deetliefs always, with everything that he \nsaid, sketched it or sketched the applicant's words to be more \nsensational in order to qualify what Deetliefs was actually looking \nfor.\n\tThe applicants was continuously questioned by Mr Bizos \nand especially as I understand, it was to prove this larger \nconspiracy and that the applicant was not making a full disclosure \nand so it was put to the applicant that he had reconnoitred \nMandela's home and that is why Mrs Beyers was called, in order \nto prove that the applicant was telling lies when he said that he \nhad reconnoitred Mr Mandela's home.\n\tAccording to the statement of Mr Deetliefs he said, and \nthat is R4, 306 continued and 361, where he says especially on \npage 361 in the middle, that would be the statement which \nDeetliefs had written but it was written as if it was the words of \nthe applicant\n\t\t\"Rekkies was also done on Mandela's house.  I \nthought the old goat was not worth it\"\nBut nowhere, on one of those cassettes, there are 10 cassettes \nwhich have bearing on Mr Walus, this does not appear on one of \nthose cassettes.  \n\tAs it appears in this statement from page 306, the \nHonourable Committee will note that 301 or 304 and 305 are the \ntyped versions of the hand-written notes.  From page 306, \nCaptain Deetliefs went to a lot of effort, he wrote his statement \nand then there's a question\n\t\t\"Captain\"\nand the question follows, then it says\n\t\t\"Walus\"\nand then there's an answer that follows.  Where are those notes \nfrom which he would have retrieved this information? \n\tHe could not submit this to the Honourable Committee \nbecause what was said there never was said in fact.  And it is also \nsaid in various places in the statement that the applicant was \nwarned according to Judges' rules.   It does not appear on the \ncassettes and it won't, it cannot because the Honourable \nCommittee must understand and it was conceded by Advocate \nBrand, that the applicant had been misled.  Captain Deetliefs \ncould not have warned him because they were busy with \nclandestine discussions where Deetliefs would be assisting the \nright-wingers, why would he warn them then?\n\tIn my heads I submitted to the Honourable Committee that \nCaptain Deetliefs was a liar and that he's nothing else but that \nand that the video cassettes and the statement are proof of that.\n\tThe applicant told the Committee that at a stage he had \ndriven past Mr Mandela's home at that point and the translation it \nwould appear, the English of the applicant in the statement is \nquite clumsy, one does not know how the translation came \nthrough from the Polish to the English but he said that it was put \nto him - I don't have it here at the moment, it was asked of him \nhow he managed to obtain the address of Mr Mandela and he said \n- and he continues, I must concede, but as, and there is such \nproof, the home of Mr Mandela appeared in the Citizen \nNewspaper and according to the applicant he drove past simply \nout of curiosity.\n\tI submit to the Honourable Committee that the target which \nthey had discussed and which was pointed out by Mr Clive Derby-\nLewis was only Mr Hani and not Mr Mandela.\n\tIt was also put to the applicant during cross-examination \nand it is also supported, that there was a conspiracy to murder \nthe others whose names appeared on the list - and I refer to R4 \non page 308, where Captain Deetliefs once again - this is point 2 \non page 308, once again it is\n\t\t\"Captain\"\nI have never seen a policeman make this kind of statement, \nnonetheless\n\t\t\"Captain Cuba, do you think there is a \npossibility that others on the list could \nstill be eliminated after your arrest\"?\nthen it is\n\t\t\"Yes, they are all bastards.

One can see \nBeetge's hand, they are planning to help the right-wingers.  \n\tAnd Deetliefs will say \"They don't want to discuss it too \nopenly because it's supposed to be a secret\".  Then Deetliefs says, \nwhile they are discussing who will be the successor of Hani, \nDeetliefs says, and this is not the applicant, Deetliefs proposes \nthat Sexwale would be the possible successor.  Then Deetliefs \nsays that \"Sexwale is a bastard\", upon which the applicant \nanswers -he's sitting there and this was recorded within the \nprison, he's sitting at the table with his head turned and he says\n\t\t\"They're all bastards\".\n\tOn the same tape further on, the typed 1301, Deetliefs is \nstill in discussion with the applicant and he expresses great praise \nof Clive Derby-Lewis, that he is such a wonderful man, that \npeople trust him - this is Deetliefs speaking, and then they discuss \nthe fact that Clive Derby-Lewis was involved with the \nWitwatersrand ...[indistinct] and then the applicant makes the \nfollowing remark\n\t\t\"Clive Derby-Lewis is a good man, he is a man of \nballs - he's a guy of balls\".\nexcuse me.\n\tWhat is contained there on page 308 does not exist. It is \nnot that it was interpreted incorrectly, it simply doesn't exist at \nall.  That which Deetliefs had written here was his own story.

Generally I will deal with \npages 1 to 20, my learned friend will deal with pages 20 to 45, \nand I will deal with the rest of the argument.  But having with \nrespect listened to the argument of Counsel for the applicants and \nthe questions that were posed by the Committee and some of the \nanswers have been given, we would like to make certain \npreliminary submissions.\n\tFirstly that before we can try to apply the facts to the \nprovisions of Section 20, the committees onerous duty is to try \nand determine the facts and the facts obviously cannot be \ndetermined without meaningful submissions having been made to \nthe committee about the credibility of the witnesses that have \ngiven evidence before you.

            "I am not unmindful of the point made judge.  What I \nam saying is that like in the case of accomplices, we don't reject \nthe evidence of an accomplice because he originally made the \nstatement to the police that he didn't know anything about it, but \nwhen the matter came nearer home to him, he made to confess to \nthe crime, but what we do require in relation to the evidence of \naccomplices is that because by nature they are unsatisfactory \npersons who were prepared to lie, we do not accept their \nevidence unless there are cogent reasons to do so, bearing in mind \nthat the oath at times doesn't mean much or anything to them \nwhen their own purposes are to be served.  I do not want to take \nit further than that, and I would certainly not make myself guilty \nof submitting that because he lied nothing that he said here \nshould be believed.  \n\tWhat I am submitting is having regard to the fact that he is \na person who was prepared to lie under oath, who said that his \nlegal representatives were responsible for his being found guilty \nbecause they did not give him proper advice and they did not give \nhim any reasons.  I don't want to repeat everything that he said in \nthe application, I want to take it now further than that and most \ncertainly do not submit that as you have indicated judged, most if \nnot all of the people have denied it in the past particularly if they \nhave been tried, but tremendous caution has got to be exercised \nin accepting the evidence of Mr Derby-Lewis so that when a \nmember of the Committee asks a question of Counsel, where is \nthis, merely to be pointed to a statement made by Mr Derby-Lewis \nwithout comparing that statement to what he said in his \napplication for amnesty, to what other witness have said and what \nthe probabilities in the case are, it is not enough to merely say Mr \nDerby-Lewis and Mr Walus said.  That's as far as I want to take it \nand I will deal specifically in relation to some of the self-serving \nstatements made by Mr Derby-Lewis which we will submit can not \nbe relied upon in order to apply it as a fact and in turn apply the \nlaw.\n\tLet me deal with Mrs Derby-Lewis.  She too admitted that \nshe lied to the Judge President of the Transvaal Provincial \nDivision in relation to the circumstances under which the list was \nhanded out, which is a matter on the very core of the matter.  \nAgain we cannot accept the evidence of Mrs Derby-Lewis merely \nbecause she has said so, we will have to have regard that she is a \nperson who is capable of lying under oath and who obviously has \na very strong desire to get her husband's release under amnesty.\n\tNow as far as Mr Walus is concerned, he too has \ncontradicted himself in relation to vital matters between the notes \nthat appear in R4 and particularly pages 362 and not the pages \nthat have been quoted by Counsel for the applicants and also, Mr \nChairman, the issue here is not what may or may not be on the \ntape, the vital passages that we rely on were read to Mr Walus \nand if you have a look at pages 98 and subsequent pages of the \nsecond record, you will see that he has for all practical purposes \nadmitted to have said the things that were recorded, but we will \ncome to that in much greater detail.  So that again what we would \nappeal to the Committee to have regard to, that the matter is to \nbe decided on with a more, with respect to Counsel for the \napplicants, a thorough examination of the facts than they have set \nout in their written heads of argument and have made submissions \nhere.\n\tThe other matter Mr Chairman that we want to say about \nthese three witnesses and in this regard I would join Mr Clarke as \nthe fourth, because he falls into the same category that there \nattitude to the fundamental changes that were taking place after \n1990 and more particularly the preparatory changes to have a new \nconstitution from 1993 onwards which was being prepared at \nCODESA was absolute anathema to them.  I do not think that we \nwill be overstating the case Mr Chairman, if they are described as \na clique or small cabal of fanatics who irrespective of what the \npolicy of their political party may have been, partly as a result of \nwhat may or may not have happened in Poland as far as Mr Walus \nis concerned, partly because of deeply felt and fanatical religious \nbeliefs, they set themselves up as saviours purporting to be \nmotivated by a religion for the vast majority of the people in the \nworld preaches peace, is an excuse to commit murder by trying to \npersuade the committee that they were really after the Antichrist \nrather than the person described in evidence by Mr Jeremy Cronen \nas the person that had done so much in order to bring \nreconciliation to the country.\n\tWith those preliminary remarks I now want to turn Mr \nChairman to page 1 of our written heads and there we submit at \n4.1 that the assassination of Mr Hani was not committed on behalf \nof, or in support of the Conservative Party.  And we submit that \nthe CP had not adopted violence and most certainly not murder as \none of their means to wage its political or ideological struggle \nagainst the African National Congress, its allied organisations or \nany other organisation.  And more particularly, and this I would \nlike to add having listened to the questions by members of the \ncommittee, and particularly there was no policy of assassination \nof a political leader with a high profile, if you would add that on \npoint 4.2 Mr Chairman.  With all the difficulties that we have had \nin our violent past, Mr Chairman, the political assassination of \nhigh profile political leaders, if not entirely unknown, was almost \nunknown on the South African scene.\n\tIt has never been suggested Mr Chairman that the killing of \nthe President or the leader of a political party, or someone, \nwhatever one's views may have been about their actions, the \ncountry's problems would be solved by killing them.  When I say \nnever, we of course have the notable example in this case where \nare going to submit it was proved that it was not only Mr Hani \nthat was on the list for elimination but also Mr Mandela, Mr \nSlovo and other political figures in the country in order to create \nthe chaos that the two applicants have spoken of.  We submit that \ntheir act could not have been permitted in the course and scope of \ntheir duties because the CP had not advised, planned, directed, \ncommanded or ordered assassinations as one of it's means of \nwaging political struggle.  Mr Derby-Lewis told us what his \nduties were, Mr Walus hardly had any duties to perform in regard \nto the Conservative Party except to possibly help with elections.  \nSo that in the course and scope of their duties, advised, planned, \ndirected or commanded or ordered by the political party.\n\tIn order to answer this question we have to say, what were \ntheir duties and was it within the purview of their duty and were \nthey ordered to do it?  One can understand Mr Chairman the \nsecurity policeman who said that I was given the duty of \nsafeguarding the security of South Africa, the politicians made \nthe decisions that this is the society that they wanted, I was a \nservant, my duty was to protect people.  The politicians \nidentified, or my superiors identified Mr Goniwe to be \nassassinated, in the furtherance of my duty, I did it.  How do \nthese two applicants bring themselves, having regard to the duties \nthat they had to perform, vis a vis the Conservative party into \nsaying that it was in the course and scope of their duties as \nmembers of the CP  Mr Chairman?  There is no such evidence and \nin our submission the applicants haven't even applied their minds \nto that question and therefore on that ground amnesty should be \nrefused.\n\tBut let's go further Mr Chairman; 4.4, the CP had not given \nany express or implied authority that assassinations of political \nopponents was sanctioned and you may notice Mr Chairman that \nwe actually draw a distinction between the assassination of \npolitical opponents of high ranking and I would ask high ranking \npolitical opponents in Section 4.4 because it is in the South \nAfrican context a most unusual thing.

I can think of no assassination of a political \nleader in the country at the instance of another political party Mr \nChairman, but it may be that I had missed something along the \nway, I don't think I have.\n\tWe then go on Mr Chairman on 4.5, the applicants can not \nrely on any implied authority or perception that violence and \nmore particularly a high ranking political leader, was one of the \nmeans of struggle in view of the standing within the CP of the \nsecond applicant and the close association between the two \napplicants who are clearly on their evidence co-conspirators \nrather than inciter and incite.  \n\tNow again Mr Chairman, where did they get this authority \nfrom, we have and particularly on the section of the argument \nthat is going to be dealt with by my learned colleague, Mr \nMalindi, we will give the Committee the references Mr Chairman \nwhere this is documented, we believe that there can be no real \nanswer to the evidence that came to Dr Hartzenberg himself, from \nthe other leaders of the Conservative Party and we will submit Mr \nChairman in so far as credibility is concerned that Dr \nHartzenberg's responses in relation to violence to Mr Venter, is \nwhat the Committee should accept as the truth and not the \npathetic figure that Mr Hartzenberg cut when he gave evidence \nbefore the Committee trying to explain this.  \n\tLet me just say briefly Mr Chairman that for him to have \nsaid that -\n \"I as the deputy leader said a few days after the \nmurder that we were the people with the moral high \nground, we did not use violence, nor assassination...\"\nto come here and try and excuse it on the basis that political \nleaders would not come out with it openly, is a pathetic attempt \nby a discredited politician to help one of his fellow party members \nof a discredited political party out of the difficulty in getting \namnesty.  \n\tAnd what we submit in 4.6 Mr Chairman or 4.5, we will \nrefer to the passages and there isn't only one, such passage, but \nparticularly one of the  passages in answer to the committee \nmember Advocate Potgieter which makes it quite clear on the \nevidence of both of them that they were co-conspirators planning \nthis together and there was no element of inciter and incitee. \n\tWe draw attention Mr Chairman that the word order was \nintroduced into Mr Derby-Lewis' vocabulary after the Max du \nPreez show was shown to him where Mr du Preez offered some \nlegal advice which he took with both hands, not legal advice - \noffered the possibility that Walus may have an additional defence, \nthat it was taken with both hands and Counsel for the applicants \nused the word order intermittently in the heads of argument \nwithout having regard to the evidence that there was this co-\nconspiratorial relationship rather than the one of inciter and \nincitee.  \n\tAnd we say in 4.6 that there are no reasonable grounds \nupon which the applicants can claim that they believed themselves \nto be acting in the course and scope of their duties, and within \nthe scope of their express or implied authority, we will rely \nheavily upon the position of Mr Derby-Lewis' in the Conservative \nParty and if Mr Walus was a co-conspirator and not an incitee \nthen it would follow in his case as well.\n\tBut there is an overwhelming probability that people as \nclose to one another as this, and we submit that Mr Walus would \nnot have given the Committee an impression that he's a weakling \nor a yes-man to anybody's will.  He bragged about his prowess in \nthe statement recorded by Mr Deetliefs and Mr Beetge and \nnothing in his demeanour or in his actions or his absence of any \nremorse on his part and the manner in which he dealt with himself \nin this court, that before this Committee, thus could not have \ngiven the impression that he's a weak person that was mislead by \nMr Derby-Lewis.",

Now I want to \nmake clear Mr Chairman that we submit that the conflicts of the \npast were coming to an end.  Counsel for the applicants said but \nlook what Mr Visser told us that Gen Viljoen was planning, that \nwas, we submit, clearly a conditional possibility, if there was not \na settlement.  As it turned out, General Viljoen himself subscribed \nto the settlement, therefore what might have happened according \nto the plans of the Volksfront at that stage which were not \npublicly known for which the applicants do not purport to have \nbeen acting on behalf of, can be left out of account, we submit.\n\tWhat is relevant and the evidence stands uncontradicted, it \nwas put down in a written statement supported by annexures \nwhich are before you as Exhibit, it's Bundle B which contains, it's \na carefully prepared statement and practically all the statements \nin it are supported by  what Mr Jeremy Cronin now says Mr Chris \nHani said at the time, but we were careful to go to the public \nrecord as to what Mr Hani was saying at the time and what he \nwas saying was obviously gaining ground and obviously not to the \nliking of the fanatics like the two applicants, Mrs Derby-Lewis \nand Mr Clarke.  \n\tAnd it is that, and when their party in April 1993 was party \nto those negotiations, Mr Chairman, how could they believe that \nkilling one of the negotiators and the general secretary of one of \nthe negotiating parties at that process where their own party was \nparticipating be in the course and scope of their duties or that \nthey had the express or implied authority?\n\tIt can be tested in this way Mr Chairman, there was Mr \nLangley there if I remember correctly, there was Mr Hartzenberg \nthere, pride of place for the television cameras of the world \nnegotiating for a settlement, these applicants say that whilst they \nwere in CODESA negotiating a settlement, these two gentlemen \nbelieved that they had express or implied authority from them to \nkill on of the top leaders of the alliance working to bring about \ndemocratic changes.\n\tAgain Mr Chairman, I must refer to these four, and I \ninclude Mr Clarke, to this day Mr Chairman they speak about a \ncommunist party take-over.  They do not accept that we had a \ndemocratic election.  To them democracy means something else \nentirely.  I mention this because we will make some references to \nit in greater detail as to whether reconciliation is about to take \nplace by people who still speak about a communist take-over \nwhen 62 or 63% of the population of this county voted for the \ngovernment that is in power.  They may be fanatics, they may be \nunreasonable, they may be beyond the pale, but none of those \nentitle them to say that they believed that they had express or \nimplied authority.  There was nothing happening at the time to \nwhich they had to react by killing a top leader.\n\tThen we say in 4.8 Mr Chairman that the Act was not \nproportional to the objective pursued in their own version and on \ntheir own version they sought to create chaos, expecting hundreds \nif not thousands of people to be killed during a race war in the \nhope that the riot would stage a coup.  This has been canvassed, I \ndo not want to take up very much more time on it at this stage, it \nwas very important for the proportionality.  But I was actually \nsomewhat surprised by the Counsel for the applicant, Mr \nChairman that the killing of Pieterse led to chaos.  I don't know \nwhy he said that, I would have thought that that would have been \na warning to his client about irrational killing of people because \nwe know that hundreds if not thousands died as a direct or \nindirect result of the wanton killing of Master Petersen on the \n16th of June 1976.\n\tAnd in 4.9 Mr Chairman the relationship between the \nobjective pursued and the act is director or proximate, \nparticularly as on their own version they had not planned or even \ninformed the CP who they claim to have represented or any \nelements, to any elements of the right.  I think that the members \nof the Committee are aware to what we are referring to in this \nregard and I will take it no further at this stage.\n\tNow in relation to full disclosure Mr Chairman, we submit \nthat the applicants have not made a full disclosure of all the \nrelevant facts and have been untruthful relating to when the \nconspiracy to kill Chris Hani was first mooted or entered into; \nwho were the victims of the conspiracy; who had become members \nof the conspiracy and more particularly Mrs Gaye Derby-Lewis \nand others who had procured the murder weapon; who procured \nthe murder weapon and the reasons thereof.  Details of this are \ngiven in the rest of the heads of argument.  \n\tIt is further submitted that the grant of amnesty to the \napplicants would be inappropriate and not in accordance with the \nobjective of the Commission to promote national unity and \nreconciliation in that the act or offence was committed during the \ntime when the country was at its most sensitive stage towards \nbuilding peace, reconciliation and democracy.  The offence was of \nsuch gravity that the chaos envisaged to result from the \nassassination could have led to the death of many innocent \ncivilians.  \n\tWell may I pause here and again refer to the evidence of Mr \nJeremy Cronin as to how near we were to a civil war and the real \nchaos that had been envisaged and the evidence that had it not \nbeen for the leadership of Mr Mandela then as President of the \nANC and Mr Tokyo Sexwale as the Transvaal Chairman of the \nANC, there would so easily have been a blood bath and a race war \nin South Africa.",

            "Probably if it had been more fully drafted it would \nhave been more - it's more appropriate to the proportionality \nargument.\n\tAnd in 5.2 according to the applicants, the struggle \ncontinues and it cannot be discounted that they remain committed \nto the objective of creating large scale chaos which will create \nconditions for a coup d'etat and this is what it was Mr Chairman, \nthis was an attempt on their own version, and attempt at coup \nd'etat and may I add here that nobody articulated more practically \nthan Mr Clarke that we had here yesterday.  \n\tPerhaps if the Committee would allow me a personal \nobservation, the applicants and their counsel thought the world of \nMr Clarke as a witness, we submit that he is so besotted by \nhatred purporting to be a fundamentalist Christian, so besotted \nwith hatred and admiration for the two murderers applying for \namnesty that I would suggest that there is very ....(tape ends)\n.. it doesn't appear in the heads of argument elsewhere,  I might \nas well deal with it at this stage Mr Chairman even though I'm on \nan overview.\n\tCounsel for the applicants dismiss the evidence of Mr \nVisser as fanciful and self-serving.  Yes it may well be but there \nare two inherent improbabilities in Mr Clarke's evidence who \ndenies that anything like that happened. \n\tFirstly why should Mr Visser have gone to Mr Clarke and \nasked Mr Clarke and Mr Roodt to apply for amnesty?  \n\tSecondly, if Mr Clarke is telling the truth that Mr Visser \nwas, he's the fault ..(indistinct) and that the relationship between \nthe two of them had soured by the time of the commission of the \nmurder, why Mr Clarke on his own version disclosed to Mr Visser \nthat there was compromising information in his computer's hard \ndisks?  Since when on the general and particular probabilities \ndoes a witness confide that sort of information?\n\t If we turn to paragraph 5 of page 3 Mr Chairman \n\t\"It is further submitted that the grant of amnesty to the \napplicants will be inappropriate and not in accordance with \nthe objective of the Commission to promote National unity \nand reconciliation in that the offence was committed during \nthe time when the country was at the most sensitive stage \nwith the building of peace, reconciliation and democracy, \nthe offence was of such a gravity that the chaos envisaged \nto result from the assassination would have led to the death \nof many innocent civilians.  According to the applicants the \nstruggle continues and it cannot be discounted that they \nremain committed with the objective of creating large scale \nchaos which will create conditions for a coup d'etat\".\n\tBut now Mr Chairman, amnesty is provided in relation in \nrelation to coup d'etat in paragraph E and by the usual argument \nof that which included excludes other possibilities.  It was only \namnesty to be given any person in the performance of a coup \nd'etat to take over the government of any former state or any \nattempt thereto.  So this was a coup d'etat, it was not for the \npurposes of preserving law and order.\n\tWe turn in paragraph 6 to  6.1  The failure to make full \ndisclosures.  We submit that Mr Derby-Lewis has lied about the \ninvolvement of Mrs Derby-Lewis in the compilation of the hit list \nand the reasons therefor.  \n\tDerby-Lewis testified that he first saw the list of the nine \nnames in Cape Town when Mrs Derby-Lewis showed it to him as \npart of the gravy train story which was to be used by Dr \nHartzenberg in Parliament. We submit that that's false Mr \nChairman. This could not be true because in January 1993 when \nMrs Derby-Lewis telephoned Arthur Kemp and sent him a list of \n90 names it was after she and Derby-Lewis had discussed it and \ndecided that unless something dramatic was done the country \nwould be controlled by a communist.  \n\"Clive and I therefore highlighted the names of \npeople whom we believed to be the enemies of South \nAfrica\".  \n\tThis comes in R4.251, paragraph 43.1, we are going to \nargue Mr Chairman in due course that their statements are \nadmissible as the ruling of the Committee indicated and that \nweight should be attached to it.  We will refer you, not to \ngeneralities or the cross-examination put to Mr De Waal, but to \nher own statements that she is unable to deny that this is what she \nsaid and that she made that freely and voluntarily despite certain \ndiscomforts that she says she suffered under. If that statement of \nMrs Derby-Lewis is admitted and what we say is that we must \ntake it together with the probabilities; the probabilities of this \nclose union between these two persons and having regard to the \ncharacter of Mrs Derby-Lewis, we are not dealing here with a \ncompliant housewife, we are dealing with a high profile \npropagandist in the Patriot who in her exaggerations and fanatical \nstatements probably has no equal and who has a mind of her own. \n No serious step in relation to the preparation of this list would \nhave been without her consent, and what we say at the bottom of \npage 4, 'on 29 April 1993 whilst in detention, Mrs Derby-Lewis \nwas shown three pages compiled as the hit list and recognised \nthem as the list of names and addresses that she had given to her \nhusband.  This is evidence that Mrs Derby-Lewis knew of what \npurpose Mr Derby-Lewis needed the list.  \n\tOf course Mr Chairman, I'll remind you at this stage that \nshe denied flatly before the Judge President of the Transvaal as it \nwas then known, that she had given the list to anyone, she made \nup a fabric of lies about it being left on her coffee table with \ncopies of the Patriot which Mr Walus may have mistakenly taken.\n\tWhen Mrs Derby-Lewis compiled the original list of 19 \nnames, she knew that the people whom she and Derby-Lewis \nconsidered to be enemies of South Africa were to be murdered, \nthat after she had received the list of 9 names, Chris Hani was \ntargeted for elimination, that the houses of the people identified \nfor elimination would be reconnoitred and that Walus the one who \nwas going to assassinate Chris Hani and we give you the passages \nin R4 Mr Chairman.  When cross-examined on why she needed \naddresses of certain people that she could either telephone or \nvisit their offices, Mrs Derby-Lewis gave some preposterous \nanswers.  Although she didn't think Hani would give her a private \ninterview in his home, she still wanted the address so that she \ncould see the way he lived.  The answer is absurd, if she was not \ngoing to be allowed into the house in the first place.  \n\tMrs Derby-Lewis gave totally unsatisfactory and evasive \nanswers to members of the Committee Mr Chairman about why \nshe would have wanted to interview certain people who appear on \nthe list and as to why she didn't visit certain journalists or \ntelephoned them at their homes instead of seeking their addresses \nthrough Mr Kemp.  \n\tWe give you the references; it was a long exchange Mr \nChairman and we submit that it bristles with improbabilities.  It is \nsubmitted that the reason she has for compiling the list be \nrejected and that it be found that the list was compiled as a hit \nlist.",

            "Well I can venture a number of reasonable \npossibilities as to why they would do that.  \n\tFirst of all, either at the time that they were doing the list \nor before that they had hoped that more people would come into \nthe conspiracy and it may be that they wanted to show them, \nthese are the enemies of the Afrikaner Volk, these are the people \nthat we must eliminate.  They wanted an order and in answer to \nJudge Wilson as to why Walus marked it 1 to 9, is a ridiculous \nanswer, with respect.  You'll recall that it was in order to speak \non the telephone by number, and I think it was the chairperson \nthat asked well if there was only going to be one, why talk in \nnumbers anyway? So that a list is some evidence that this was or \nwas intended to be a wider conspiracy than we have heard of \nhere.\n\tThe other of course is, criminal investigators in the \nadministration of justice thrive on it.  Many of the people that \nplan similar crimes are just stupid.  In the Goniwe matter they \ndropped a name plate, otherwise the Goniwe people would just \nhave disappeared for ever.  It is the sort of thing, the sort of \noversight or the sort of conduct which makes investigation \npossible.  But certainly what it is not, is a list for journalistic \npurposes because we have the evidence of  Mrs Derby-Lewis in \nthe criminal trial.  \n\tWe will refer you to the passage Mr Chairman where His \nLordship Mr Justice Eloff holds the evidence to be highly \nimprobable.  However in that criminal trial there was an onus \nwhich had to be discharged and probabilities were not enough.  \nThe Committee here, and this is why she could not be convicted \non the second count of conspiring to kill the people on the list, \nbut here we had the additional evidence, their own statements, we \nhave the evidence here of what Mr Derby-Lewis admits to doing \nwhich was not before His Lordship Mr Justice Eloff and I would \nsubmit that although the Committee will accept the learned \nJudge's view that it was highly improbable, what has come forth \nsince, that Mr Derby-Lewis indeed had this list, that he did get it \nfrom his wife, that he did give it to Walus, that he and Walus, on \ntheir own version had planned the assassination, so that claiming \nthat this was an innocent list on the probabilities was unlikely for \nJudge Eloff correctly, for this Committee it is beyond reasonable \ndoubt.  \n\tThat is the submission that we make in relation to the list \nand Mr Derby-Lewis lied about it, Mr Walus lied about the \npurpose of the list, Mrs Derby-Lewis lied in relation to the \npurposes of the list.  Therefore in relation to lack of full \ndisclosure, if our submission is well-founded that all three of \nthem knew that there were to be more than one victim and at least \nanother appears in the list of nine, then each one of them has \nfailed to disclose the truth.\n\tLet us take it on the probabilities.  After all we only have \nthe wrong-doers testimony to work on and it may well be that \nnone of them was expressly prepared to say or Walus was not \nprepared to say that I knew that this was drawn up by Mrs Derby-\nLewis and I knew that it was a hit list for the nine, if the \ninference can be drawn, and we submit clearly that it can, that all \nthree of them knew what they were doing and what they were \nsaying about the nine people on the list, there has not been full \ndisclosure, that neither of them is entitled to amnesty and it is a \npity that the safeguards of double jeopardy, Mrs Derby-Lewis \ndoes not have to answer any more to Mr Hani's death in a court \nof law.",

            "Although that is a theoretical possibility, the \nadmissions of Mrs Derby-Lewis in R4 exclude it \nbecause she says, I can read the passages now - 251 \nof R4 Mr Chairman.\n\"In January 1963 I telephoned Arthur Kemp at the\nCitizen in Johannesburg and said I was going to send\nhim a list of names and that I wanted a description of\ntheir houses and addresses.  This was done after much \nserious thought and because Clive and I felt that \nunless something dramatic was done the country \nwould be controlled by the communists\".\n\t\tNow may I just for one moment deal with the \nquestion of admissibility and weight at this stage?  This is \ncompletely consistent with what all of them said.  So how \ndoes it help the applicants to say that words were put into \nthe mouths of Mrs Derby-Lewis or Walus or Mr Derby-\nLewis? \n\"Clive and I therefore highlighted the names of people \nwhom we believed to be the enemies of South Africa. \n Certain names were added to the list I sent to Arthur \nsuch as Justice Goldstone and certain newspaper \npeople.  Goldstone's address was needed to determine \nwhere he lived because I wanted to do an article on \nhow he who helped to break down the Group Areas \nAct was now living in a white are far away from the \nresults of his 1984 Govender Judgment'.\nNow it also says something about Mrs Derby-Lewis Mr Chairman, \nnot an unformed person, she knows the name of the case.  \n\t'The journalists address were requested because I wanted to \nwrite about them about their attitudes towards the CP.  I \nasked Mr Pik Botha's address because there strong rumours \nthat he owned property overseas.  This has been reported in \nthe in the Afrikaner newspaper and perhaps the company \nwhich owned his property here, if a company owned it, \nwould be the same company which owned the overseas \nproperties.  When I asked Arthur on the phone about \nsupplying the addresses, I did not go into specifics.  He is \npolitically shrewd and I believe that he felt that there was \nno need to spell out why we needed the names.  After all we \nwere on the phone'.\nNow is not that the statement of a conspirator, is that the \nstatement of a person who wanted to write about the gravy train, \nabout which she had already written before and had shouted it \nfrom the roof tops?  Why would she not want to discuss it on the \ntelephone now.  I'm reminded the clandestine way in which Mr \nClarke has bothered to take it to the Rotunda and to hand it over \nto him in his absence or out of his hearing on his evidence if he is \nto be believed.  \tThat's not a list but we go further.  On page \n252, paragraph 44, certain of the names on the list we believe to \nbe the enemies of South Africa.  \n\t'Clive and I had vague plans in the beginning that some sort \nof arrangement should be made to liquidate one or perhaps \nmore leaders of the ANC and the SACP Communist Party.  \nThe people on this list whom I believe to be the enemies of \nSouth Africa were the participants in 'Operation Vula'.  \nYou've heard the echo yesterday from Mr Clarke who were never \nprosecuted by the government and member of the ANC and SACP \nCommunist Party.  Some of the names were Maharaj, Hani, \nMandela Kasrils, Naidoo, Ramaphosa and Slovo.  \n\t'Clive and Kuba decided on Chris Hani to be eliminated \nbecause of his particularly brutal record and his position as \nchairman of the SA Communist Party which they believed \nnever should have been unbanned.  Clive and Kuba wanted a \ndescription of the residences and I can only assume that this \nwas to determine what sort of security surrounded the \nhouses.  I simply asked Arthur what was asked of me; I'm \nnot a logistics person, nor was I present at any discussions \nin '93 between Kuba and Clive about logistics', \nnot about the conspiracy, just the logistics.  \n\t'It does not  mean to say I am denying that discussions \nbetween the two of them were not going on.  Clive told me \nsometime in March that he and Kuba had decided about \nChris Hani as the person to be eliminated.  I don't know \nwhat Clive and Kuba discussed about the other enemies \nmentioned on the list, Arthur Kemp phoned ..' \nmay I pause here.  \n\tHer previous statements make it quite clear that Hani was \nnot alone, there was a whole list, what she says here,\n\t'Arthur Kemp phoned me to say that he had got some of the \naddresses I had asked for and I asked him to fax them to \nme.  I asked  him to fax the street address and the \ndescription of the residence referring to the ANC/SAC \npeople and the description of the residences referring to the \nANC/SAC people'.  \nI suppose she didn't want a description of Mr Justice Goldstones \nif she's telling the truth about the article and not if he was not on \nthe hit list, it's possible. And the reporters that she wanted to - it \nmay be that there may have been people there as a camouflage, \npossibly but there is no doubt about the description of the \nresidences referring to the ANC/SAC people and if we look at the \nexhibit with the nine names on, I can't remember whether \neveryone was an ANC/SACP person but certainly the majority, \nbut with these fanatics Mr Chairman, who is an ANC/SACP \nperson isn't a matter of nice distinction as far as they are \nconcerned on the evidence I would submit, but anyone who is not \nfanatically preoccupied with herrenvolk ideas is a communist or \nan ANC person.\n\tThen on page 253 that, \n\t'Arthur and I met at the Rotunda where Arthur gave me the \nnames and the few other clippings for which I had asked \nhim and Arthur told me that he was resigning from the \nCitizen and that he felt tired and was sick of ...(indistinct), \nArthur said that he would be doing other things with his life \nnot connected with this, generally such as statements, \nbusiness and other...(indistinct).  I presume Arthur wanted \nto seem me rather than just faxing the list because he saw \nthe implications of the list and felt he should not fax it to \nme.'\nNow isn't that a conspiratorial way of dealing with things? I will \ndeal with it in due course but what I want to emphasise at this \nstage, that where we have an improbable story told in the \nSupreme Court where ridiculous explanations are given by the \nwitness in the witness box and where we do know that the \nhandwriting on the list is that of Walus, we know that Mr Derby-\nLewis and Mr Walus had discussion on the list, that they were the \nones that planned the murder, it becomes proof beyond reasonable \ndoubt on Mrs Derby-Lewis' false evidence, coupled with the \nstatements that she made which have not been shown to have been \nmade under any sort of pressure, not only that what the applicants \nhave to show that her treatment was such that she was in due \ncourse to lie about herself, about Walus and about her husband, \nshe specifically disavowed any such happening in relation to her. \nShe was specifically asked and we will further commit it to the \npassage by a member of the committee, and I have a graphic \nrecollection of it, \n\t'Despite all these things that happened to you..', \nif I remember correctly, it was the Chairman but I may be \nmistaken.\n\t'Did you tell them anything which was untrue?'\nand the answer was no.  And let us remind ourselves how \nuntruthful she was in relation to the portions that she learned \nwere not on the video which was available.  She blue hot and cold \nand we refer to the cross-examination and these are the passages \nwhich are - if I could refer you to page 402 of R4, it's the \ncontinued portion, R4 continued, 402.  Well could we start with \nItem number 47.\n\t'On the Sunday I saw Kuba's photograph in the newspaper \nand recognised him at once.  I was very shocked but in my \nheart not at all surprised.  There had been a lot of talk \nbetween right wingers of solutions to the problems in the \ncountry'.    \nThis is the evidence her.\n\t'Clive said that he had discussed these things with Kuba'.  \nWell that's true as a fact and of overwhelming probability that her \nloving husband would have told his loving wife.  \n\t'Clive was upset and I asked him what he was going to do'. \nA highly probable conversation after the wife party to a \nconspiracies was speaking to her husband after they found out \nthat the one of the victims of their conspiracy had been murdered.\n\t'He said that during the discussions with Kuba they had \nmentioned such a thing like Hani's death, he said that he \nhadn't thought that Kuba would do such a thing at all'.\nWell it's partly true but certainly not the statement of a person \nwho is being coerced to give evidence against her husband or for \nany other purpose.  \n\t'He did say that he couldn't understand why Kuba had been \nso stupid to drive around so obvious, Kuba was supposed to \nchange the number plates.  He did admit to me however \nthey had discussed it.  Clive did however say it looked like \na set-up, seeing Kuba was caught so quickly.  We suspected \nAPLA, we talked about Hani suddenly talking peace when \nhe was the manifestation of the resistance.  Hani criticised \nthe PAC in the week or two prior to the killing.  Clive \nthought that either APLA, the government or someone was \nbehind it, as it didn't should like Kuba who would go into a \nsituation head-on.  I asked Clive about the gun but he did \nsay he couldn't tell me where he had got the gun from'.\nNow one does not dismiss that sort of evidence corroborative of \nthe overwhelming probability found by Judge Eloff even without \nthis.\n\tThen on top of page 6, during the criminal trial, Mrs Derby-\nLewis had given one other reason for the list to be the purpose to \nwrite a book with Mrs Ida Parker in addition to the list being for \nthe purposes of conducting interviews or for use by Dr \nHartzenberg.  The court held that Mrs Derby-Lewis was not \ntruthful about the list and that here explanations were far fetched \nand that is the reference Mr Chairman to the criminal record.\n\tIn her statement during detention Mrs Derby-Lewis says she \ndid not show the list to anyone in Cape Town including Mr \nDerby-Lewis, that is in the statement and we give  you the \nreference, I submit that it's a correct reference, I don't want to \nread them unless members of the Committee want me to.  Her \nevidence before the Committee that she placed this list on Dr \nHartzenberg's table and the evidence of Dr Hartzenberg that you \nsaw documents on his table in Parliament, placed there by Mrs \nDerby-Lewis must be regarded as false.  Derby-Lewis is correct \nwhen he says that he took responsibility for compiling the list \nwhen he made his statement in detention in order to protect his \nwife.  His wife needed protection because the list was a hit list \nand he and Walus had already been arrested.",

In pursuance of \nwhat Mr Bizos said, I suggested to the Committee that we will \nhave it transcribed, and this developed subsequent to the \nadjournment period.\n\tMembers of the Committee, we have already submitted \nheads of argument and subsequently heads of argument have been \nreceived from the members of the family.  These heads were \nreceived on the Thursday and unfortunately they were received \nlate.  Mr Bizos had other obligations, but we will leave it at that.\n\tHonourable Chairperson, our heads have been discussed \nthoroughly under various topics.   I would like to refer to a \nnumber of aspects with reference to the testimony and in light of \nthe fact that further new evidence was submitted, since the \nsubmission of the heads, and if preferred as such, we could submit \nwritten heads of argument in response to Mr Bizos' heads of \nargument to the Committee.\n\tI would like to argue with respect that the applicants firstly \ncomplies with the provisions of the relevant Section 21(c) and \nwith specific reference to the applicant's action in support of the \nConservative Party, that he believed on a bona fide basis that he \nwas supporting the cause of the Conservative Party.  With \nreference to the aspect of his actions in support of the \nConservative Party, I refer you to the judgment of the S v Maloi \nand others in SA Court Reports, 1987 1 (196) (A), judgment of \nPresiding Appeal Court, Judge Boshoff, and specifically on page \n210, H - I and also on page 211, and 212 H - I.\n\tWith respect in this respect, I would like to argue that in \nthat judgment it was necessary that the party had to have been \naware of the actions which were undertaken by the applicants.\n\tIt is my argument that under these circumstances the \napplicant who was an Executive Member of the Consecutive \nParty, acted in support of the Party.  There is no evidence to the \ncontrary which supports that the applicant acted maliciously or \nacted in any way for his own interests or to promote his own \ninterests.\n\tThe Committee with respect, should consider what the \npolitical history of the country was, which preceded all these \nevents, where the country was governed by a white government, \nwhich consisted of the National Party, later the Conservative \nParty and the National Party which devolved by following a \ndifferent policy and had a vision of a unity State and the \nConservative Party's vision was that of separate development and \neach nation governing itself.\n\tThis was the strong policy of the Conservative Party which \nwas not negotiable according to them, and in short, it took place \nthat the party according to the evidence of Dr Hartzenberg, the \nleader of the Conservative Party, that the democratic process at a \nstage, was closed and that negotiations would serve no further \npurpose and that according to the evidence of Mr Derby-Lewis, \nthe Codesa negotiations were overwhelmed or dominated by \nmembers of the Communist Party and as seen by the Conservative \nParty, communist rule was at the order of the day and with \nrespect, this fact was a fact according to the people and the party \nwho believed that there was a threat which was eminent and that \nthere was no other option but to mobilise on all fronts, there was \ntalk of war.\n\tThere was a climate of war.  Yesterday evidence was given \nabout it again, Visser and Clark, Dr Hartzenberg have all testified \nin terms of this, the applicants have testified in terms of this, and \nat this stage there are applications for amnesty which indicate or \nwhich go as far as May 1994.\n\tI would like to argue with respect that it was not indicated \nto the contrary that it could be said that there was no state of \nundeclared war.",

In other words he knew \nwhat Deetliefs had said and he said he did not know.  \n\tFurthermore he said she stated that her husband never \nindicated a firearm, while her husband during questioning did \nindicate a firearm.  She went further, saying that she now \nremembered.\n\tIf we look at the statement, her handwritten statement, \nparagraph 66 on page 158 of the typed version, it's page 159, \nparagraph 72\n\t\t\"then that Cuba had possibly done the deed and Clive \nand I later confirmed that Cuba had used the gun \nwhich Clive showed me one day in the house (with a \nsilencer).

            "That's correct Mr Chairman.  Just a moment \nplease.  If you take into consideration that Mrs Derby-Lewis, \ninitially during her incarceration while she was questioned by \nDeetliefs before she was under Section 29 but she did not have \nlegal representation, under each question she said\n\t\t\"No answer, no comment.\"\nafter that she was under Section 29 and van Niekerk said\n\t\t\"She had to talk.\"\n\tMr Chairman, then I want to submit that these statements of \nhers do not have any value for the Committee to use it against the \napplicant because they were taken under those circumstances.  \nWith respect Mr Chairman, this Committee is aware of what \nSection 29 entailed.  Today there is evidence of how people were \nhandled to get the necessary information.  Today it's not a law \nanymore and today it could even be claimed to be \nunconstitutional.  \n\tThere was an instance, I don't have the Judgment, where in \na Civil Case they wanted to present a statement in a case of a \nwitness being held under Section 29 and it was argued that that \nSection was unconstitutional and it could not be relied on because \nof that.  This also makes sense in this regard.\n\tMr Chairman, if you look at the statement taken or made by \nMr Derby-Lewis and under the circumstances - firstly on the \nvideo recording, I think it's video recording number 3, it is \nclearly indicated how Mr Derby-Lewis begged Mr Deetliefs that \nhe needed a legal representative and he said he could not make a \nstatement under those circumstances.  You could see on that \nvideo recording, it speaks for itself how he acted under those \ncircumstances and Mr Derby-Lewis afterwards, how he was \nbroken down and then he made a statement.  \n\tWhat is the value then of a statement made under those \ncircumstances and furthermore where he is told\n\t\t\"We are going to lock up your wife.\"\nHe said he was protecting his wife and that was just natural, \nwhile he knew that that list which was used was a list presented \nto his wife by Arthur Kemp.  That was a list from him to her and \nthat had a certain connection with his wife.  With respect, it was \njust a natural thing to protect his wife.\n\tIn his evidence he told us how he obtained the list.  He said \nhe saw the list in Cape Town, he described the circumstances.  \nDoctor Hartzenberg supports the fact that documents were placed \non his desk by Mrs Derby-Lewis, he supports her evidence.  There \nis no reason why Doctor Hartzenberg would tell a lie about \nsomething like that.\n\tAnd shortly Mr Chairman without using anymore of your \ntime, these statements have little if no value at all, these \nstatements which were taken under Section 29.  And the \nCommittee should rely on the evidence provided by Mrs Derby-\nLewis in this regard. \n\tMr Chairman, the evidence regarding the list.  We \nunderstand from the family that it is alleged that there was a big \nconspiracy, that apart from these two applicants it's also alleged \nthat Mrs Derby-Lewis - and also regarding the way in which the \nfirearm was obtained - I've already referred to du Randt and Mrs \nVenter, Mr Venter's evidence was that Mr Derby-Lewis asked for \na weapon for stockpiling. \n\tWith respect, under the circumstances there is no evidence \nto the contrary and why would he tell Mr Venter that he was \ngoing to murder somebody with that weapon and then broaden a \nconspiracy which would have been unprofessional to do, to \ncommit such a deed.  \n\tThe same applies for Mr du Randt.  And it seems from his \nstatement made to the police, that he is innocent.  Mr Derby-\nLewis could not tell him anything, he was in custody.  He could \nnot tell Venter because he was in custody.  Mr Venter acted on \nhis own behalf.  \n\tRegarding Mr Kemp, during the trial and receiving further \nparticulars the State said that Mr Kemp was not a co-conspirator. \n In the Court Judge Eloff also treated him likewise.  Mr \nChairman, this list with 19 names was faxed to Mr Kemp from \nMrs Derby-Lewis, it was an open fax line.  At that time, and it's \nno secret, telephones were tapped and faxes were intercepted so \nsomebody would have been stupid, if it was a secret, to convey it \nin such a manner.\n\tShe leaves those 19 names on her computer and the police \nhad access to that computer.  She knew then that on the 12th of \nApril that list would become involved and that would be damning \nevidence.  If she - why would she then leave that list on the \ncomputer, Mr Walus had already been arrested and there was a lot \nof fuss in the media?\n\tHonourable Chairman, Mrs Derby-Lewis was found innocent \nduring the trial, why would she now here, she has no reason now \nto come and say \"I was not a co-conspirator\", there's nothing for \nher to lose.  If she comes here and says she was a co-conspirator \nshe could have made an amnesty application, she knew her \nhusband was applying for amnesty for perjury or anything like \nthat.  She does not apply for amnesty because she believes she \nwas not a co-conspirator.  \n\tIf you look at these statements written by the police, they \nwant to involve her, those parts which were put in.   And in the \nend it looks as if for the police that later on she could have heard \nabout these things but she did not know it in the planning stages \nwhile planning an assassination.\n\tWith respect Mr Chairman, Arthur Kemp was the author of \nthis list, he is the person who decided about this list.  That was \nhis evidence in the Supreme Court,  he compiled this list, she had \nno control over that.  And right from the beginning she said she \nrequired that list in order to obtain information to write certain \nthings in the Patriot and a lot has been said about that.\n\tWith respect, look at the list itself.  Should it be a murder \nlist one would have expected that there would have been full \nparticulars.  For example regarding Mr Chris Hani, all you find \nthere is an address that says nothing, it's insignificant.  It can't be \nregarded as a murder list.  ...[intervention]",

            "Then I would like to deal with Section \n22(a) which I would present to the Committee.  This is the \nsection which reads that the offence for which the applicant is \napplying should be a deed which is related a political objective.  \n\tI would like to present to the Honourable Committee that \nthe applicant was a member of the Conservative Party.  It is \nargued that after the deed the Conservative Party apparently said \nin the media that he was not a member of the Conservative Party. \n I would like to argue to you that that indeed was his testimony.  \nMr Hartzenberg testified and he made no mention that he was not \na member of the Conservative Party.\n\tThe applicant presented his background, his birth in Poland \nto the Committee and his experience of the Communist Party.   I \nwould like to present to the Committee that his background in \nPoland and his experience of the Communist Party was not \npresented to the Committee in order to say that he had developed \na hatred towards Communists on that basis and that is why the \ndeed was committed, but if one studies his testimony it is not \nindicated in any other way.  He did this in order to say to the \nCommittee that he knew what would happen if the country would \nbe ruled by a communist dispensation.\n\tThe applicant immigrated to South Africa and because he \ncame to South Africa he became involved in politics, although at \nthat stage he was not a citizen of our country and could not \nparticipate in elections.  From the initial stages he realised that \nchanges were taking place in the country and he became closely \ninvolved with the Conservative Party's breaking away.  \n\tAt that point he was quite aware of South African politics \nand he realised, as it is set out, that the policy which prevailed at \nthat point was about change and that there might be a possible \ncommunist dispensation in government.\n\tHe met Mr and Mrs Derby-Lewis during 1995 and became \nfurther involved in politics and assisted the Conservative Party \nwith elections and by-elections.  And after he was granted \ncitizenship in 1988, before that time in 1985 he also became a \nmember of the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging and when he was \ngranted citizenship in 1989 he participated in his first election in \nSouth Africa.\n\tHe also testified that he realised in 1990, when the \nANC/SACP was legalised, that there was a definite problem which \nwas developing in South Africa and he believed that there would \nbe  an ANC/SACP rule in the government.\n\tHe was also present when Dr Andries Treurnicht delivered a \nspeech at the Voortrekker Monument in May 1990 where the third \nstruggle for freedom was mentioned.  And he testified that during \nthat meeting Dr Andries Treurnicht swept or called the masses of \npeople who attended the meeting, called them to battle.  And \nafter that he attended negotiations where the Conservative Party \ndecided that they should ready themselves for a possible war.\n\tIn 1992 he was also further involved, and he testified \nregarding that, he was involved in the referendum which was to \ntake place and it was decided afterwards that the democratic road \nwas most definitely for the Afrikaner, as definitely closed for the \nAfrikaner nation of which he regarded himself to be a member.\n\tThe applicant who was involved in politics as I have just \nargued, was more involved with the second applicant, Mr Clive \nDerby-Lewis, and his politics. What appears very strongly within \nhis testimony is that he as an immigrant from Poland.  He came to \nbe under the influence of Mr Clive Derby-Lewis, that he regarded \nhim as a political leader and not just a politician and he also \nregarded him as one of the policy makers of the Conservative \nParty.\n\tAfter the referendum in 1992 it was very clear to the \napplicant that the CP and the other right-wing groups - and I wish \n to argue that it should be considered that he was also involved in \nAWB meetings.  AWB was one of the right-wing groups and the \nAWB was not and is not a political party.  The members of the CP \nbelonged to the CP as a political party and to the AWB as a right-\nwing organisation.  It is not to say that the members of the AWB \ncould not have been Conservative Party members.\n\tDr Ferdie Hartzenberg testified - and I'm still dealing with \nthis under the fact that this offence occurred within a political \nstruggle as Section 22(a) determines, Dr Ferdie Hartzenburg \ntestified that it was not the policy of the CP, the written policy \nwhich they as a political party expressed or carried out.  Violence \nwas not their policy.\n\tHowever Dr Ferdie Hartzenberg's testimony must be seen \nvery thoroughly as an entirety.  He testified that during \nAugust/September 1992, after the signing of the Record of \nUnderstanding that was between the National Party and the ANC, \nthe CP realised that it was now involved in a political struggle. \n\tUp until that point the CP had achieved quite a level of \nsupport in politics.  They won a number of by-elections and it \nbecame very clear that the Conservative Party which at that point \nhad already become the opposition, if there were to be a general \nelection the voters - that would be before it was an open election \nfor all population groups, the CP realised that it might able to \ndefeat the National Party.  But with the undersigning of the \nRecord of Understanding the CP realised, and this was made clear \nfrom every platform from their supporters, that now there was an \noverwhelming struggle and that the Afrikaner nation's freedom \nwas in danger because if the ANC/SACP Alliance came into \npower, the Afrikaner nation would lose it's freedom.\n\tAnd the policy - this is his testimony, the CP's policy was \nto strive for the freedom of the Afrikaner nation and it did not \nchange since the establishment of the Conservative Party.  Now \nwith the signing of the Record of Understanding, this freedom of \nthe Afrikaner was put in danger and that is how the CP regarded \nit and it was also expressed as such.\n\tHe also testified that it was very clear to the Conservative \nParty that the ANC and especially the SACP under the leadership \nof Mr Chris Hani would not grant the Afrikaner nation it's own \nterritory, they wanted a unity state.  And he also testified about \nan army which Mr Hani had ready, with 10 000 troops if the vote \ndid not swing in favour of the ANC and the negotiations for the \nunity state would be enforced with violence.\n\tThe testimony of Dr Hartzenberg continued and said that as \na result of this political struggle which existed or ruled the \ncountry at that point - it cannot be seen as anything else, the CP \ndecided to mobilise in all areas, not only religiously or in the \neducational sphere, on all levels.\n\tThe CP mobilised to resist the ANC/SACP Alliance in terms \nof the threat towards the Afrikaner nation.",

Their followers heard about violence and \nthat they had to use to protect their liberty.\n\tIt was also clear from his evidence that the political \nstruggle was, and he said \"The National Party betrayed the \nAfrikaner people and the struggle after the legalisation of the \nANC/SACP and the struggle was then against those \norganisations\".\n\tMr Chairman, in my heads I also referred to 22(d) and I \nwant to submit that in order to qualify for amnesty, the applicant \nhe had to make full disclosure of the offence and according to \nwhich - this article, he is applying for amnesty.\n\tA lot has been said about the fact that there was wider \nconspiracy than only that between these two applicants and then \nbecause of the application there was not full disclosure.  I want \nto put it to you that the applicant's evidence indicates that at the \nend of 1992  he was in Europe and after his return in December \n1992 he made contact with Mr Clive Derby-Lewis.  \n\tBefore he had left for Europe this struggle in the country \nwas already going on and when he returned in December this \npolitical situation in the country was discussed further.\n\tHis evidence is, and there's no other evidence contradicting \nthat, that at that stage the political situation in the country was \ndiscussed and not at any stage that they then decided that \nanybody had to be eliminated.\n\tIn February 1993, the applicants visited Mr Clive Derby-\nLewis again and then received the instruction and the planning \nwas made to murder Mr Hani.  It is evident from the first \napplicant's evidence that Mr Derby-Lewis provided a list to him.  \n I want to argue that should the Committee find that Mrs Derby-\nLewis, based on her statements based on Section 29, as Ngoepe \npointed out to Mr Prinsloo, if the Committee finds that Mrs \nDerby-Lewis knew beforehand that there was planning being done \nto murder Mr Hani, I want to submit that the applicant, Mr \nWalus, had no knowledge of this whatsoever.   He did not know \nthat which Mrs Derby-Lewis knew, there is no indication.\n\tEven in the Section 29 statements or any other evidence, \nthere is any indication that Mr Walus knew that Mrs Derby-Lewis \nknew what her husband - Mr Walus did not have any knowledge \nthat he discussed it with her.",

            "Thank you.\n\tI finished on page 14.  The applicant undertook to execute \nthe elimination of Mr Hani on his own and on that very same day \nwhen the order was given to him he requested of Mr Clive Derby-\nLewis to issue him an unlicensed firearm.  They also discussed it \nand it was decided that Mr Hani's home would be reconnoitred \nand early in March 1993 they reconnoitred the home of Mr Hani a \nnumber of times in order to establish the routine and movements \nof the home.  \n\tOn the 6th of April 1993, he visited Mr Derby-Lewis at his \nhome after an invitation from Mr Derby-Lewis to have breakfast \nthere that morning.  On that day the unlicensed firearm was \nhanded over to Mr Walus.  There was a discussion which involved \nthat Mr Derby-Lewis would provide him with further ammunition \nand the silencer which was fitted to the firearm could not be used \nwith regular ammunition.\n\tOn the 7th of April, Mr Walus once again contacted Mr \nDerby-Lewis or visited him in order to determine whether any \nchanges had been made to the plans and whether he had managed \nto gain ammunition for him.  At that point he had not received \nany ammunition.  According to Mr Walus' testimony the only \nfurther suggestion which was made to him was that the \nelimination be undertaken before the Easter weekend.\n\tOn the 10th of April a Saturday, Mr Walus went, not with \nthe purpose to shoot Mr Hani on that specific day, according to \nhis testimony, he went for his regular exercise at a certain sports \ncentre.  Thereafter he decided or the place or facility was closed \nbecause it was a public holiday and he decided that he would do \nfurther reconnaissance.  He had tested the weapon on his \nbrother's small holding and found that the silencer could not fire \nautomatically.\n\tHe then decided that he would buy ammunition with his own \nfirearm licence which would be the same ammunition as for the \nunlicensed weapon.  He took a drive to go and do further \nreconnaissance at Mr Hani's home.  From the testimony of Mr \nWalus you can see that it concurs with the testimony given in the \nSupreme Court.  And on that day he saw Mr Hani in front of his \nhouse where he was climbing into his vehicle and there were no \nbodyguards present.\n\tInitially he thought that it was Mr Hani but he wanted to \nmake certain and he drove along behind the vehicle until it came \nto a shopping centre where Mr Hani\nclimbed out of the vehicle and was positively identified as Mr \nHani.  Thereafter when Mr Hani departed, he took another road \nand stopped behind Mr Hani's vehicle whereupon he climbed out, \ncalled out his name, Mr Hani reacted to that, he turned around \nand Mr Walus shot Mr Hani.  He shot him four times.\n\tThereafter he departed and from the Court case his vehicle \nwas identified by Mrs Harmse and Mr Walus was arrested shortly \nafter the events.  \n\tIn terms of Section 21(c), that is on page 21, it is clear that \nit is required by law that the applicant provide a full disclosure of \nall the relevant facts regarding the events.  If there are certain \nsmall issues which might not have any bearing matters which were \nemphasised during the hearing, especially with regard to Mr \nWalus and his actions, his brother dead after the glass works were \ndeclared insolvent, these details are of minor import and not \nrelevant.\n\tI would like to submit to the Honourable Committee that \nthe applicant has made a full disclosure of all the relevant facts \nand the legal counsel of the family and the SACP have submitted \nthe statements before the Committee. And the so-called \nstatements which Mr Walus would have made to Captain Deetliefs \nand with the intention of the submission of these statements to \nthe Committee, the intention is to make it clear that there are \nfacts which the applicant did not disclose and there is a greater \nconspiracy.  \n\tThe applicant was arrested and detained in the Benoni \npolice cells and it would appear quite clearly from the \ndocumentation that he did not want to make any statement unless \nhe had legal representation.  He was taken from the cells by \nvarious police officers and interviewed or questioned by various \npolice officers until, on the 14th of April 1993, he fell into the \nhands of Captain Deetliefs.  \n\tHe was once again taken out to his residence by Captain \nDeetliefs, taken back to his cell and on that day, the 14th of April \nthe applicant said to Captain Deetliefs that he would like use his \nright to silence and did not wish to make any statements unless \nhis legal representative was present.\n\tOn the 15th of April 1993 until early morning hours of the \n16th of April, the applicant the applicant was questioned for 11 \nhours and according to Captain Deetliefs notes were taken which \nare not available.  No statement was taken from the applicant on \nthat particular evening.  \n\tIn the early morning hours the applicant was placed back in \nhis cells, that is on the 16th at twenty past five.  That very same \nafternoon, at 16H05 he was once again taken out of the cell and \nonce again questioned for approximately 14 hours and yet again \nnotes were not taken and no statement was taken either.  \n\tThe early morning hours of 16 April 1993, approximately \n04H15 that morning the applicant began, according to Mr \nDeetliefs, to cooperate.  That is so, the applicant has confirmed \nthis.  The applicant confirmed that he cooperated as a result of \nthe fact that Captain Deetliefs caught him or tricked him and by \nmeans of lies he led him to believe, this is Deetliefs, that he had \ninfiltrated the security police, that they were actually cooperating \nwith Tienie Groenewaldt and that if he would cooperate it could \nresult that Mr Holmes, who was the investigating officer in this \ncase at that time, would not make any further arrests and that \nDeetliefs was actually working for the right-wingers.\n\tThe applicant in his testimony stated that he was extremely \nnaive and he realised this later, it was naive of him to believe \nCaptain Deetliefs.  The only notes which are available from this \nquestioning, from which point on the applicant would have been \ncooperating, would the hand-written notes - just a moment please, \npage 84, 85 and 86, that would be in R4.\n\tThere are the only notes from all these hours of questioning \nwhich were provided by Captain Deetliefs and can be provided.  If \nthe video cassettes are watched it is logical that there wouldn't be \nany notes, however in Captain Deetliefs' statement which is to be \nfound in R4 continued he at several points mentions that notes \nwere taken down by Mr Beetge.  \n\tThat cannot be so because he could not make a statement to \nthe Attorney General of the Witwatersrand, Mr Klaus von Leerus \nat that time, in which he would state, in terms of everything that \nhad happened, that he was infiltrating the police and working \nalong with Tinnie Groenewaldt and that is why there weren't any \nnotes.

            "His first statement is in the first pages, \npage 299 and then it is placed again at a later point in the same \nbundle but I will refer you to these statements.\n\tThe applicants has also mentioned that during those long \nhours of questioning, alcohol was given to him.  That was \nconfirmed.  One can also see on one of the video cassettes that he \nis drinking beer.  The applicant said that he could have been given \nsedatives because the alcohol effected him quite severely.  \n\tBut the most important aspect is that Captain Deetliefs \ntricked the applicant with his lies.  The applicant then provided \nthese details as appears in the hand-written documents but the \napplicant testifies that Deetliefs always, with everything that he \nsaid, sketched it or sketched the applicant's words to be more \nsensational in order to qualify what Deetliefs was actually looking \nfor.\n\tThe applicants was continuously questioned by Mr Bizos \nand especially as I understand, it was to prove this larger \nconspiracy and that the applicant was not making a full disclosure \nand so it was put to the applicant that he had reconnoitred \nMandela's home and that is why Mrs Beyers was called, in order \nto prove that the applicant was telling lies when he said that he \nhad reconnoitred Mr Mandela's home.\n\tAccording to the statement of Mr Deetliefs he said, and \nthat is R4, 306 continued and 361, where he says especially on \npage 361 in the middle, that would be the statement which \nDeetliefs had written but it was written as if it was the words of \nthe applicant\n\t\t\"Rekkies was also done on Mandela's house.  I \nthought the old goat was not worth it\"\nBut nowhere, on one of those cassettes, there are 10 cassettes \nwhich have bearing on Mr Walus, this does not appear on one of \nthose cassettes.  \n\tAs it appears in this statement from page 306, the \nHonourable Committee will note that 301 or 304 and 305 are the \ntyped versions of the hand-written notes.  From page 306, \nCaptain Deetliefs went to a lot of effort, he wrote his statement \nand then there's a question\n\t\t\"Captain\"\nand the question follows, then it says\n\t\t\"Walus\"\nand then there's an answer that follows.  Where are those notes \nfrom which he would have retrieved this information? \n\tHe could not submit this to the Honourable Committee \nbecause what was said there never was said in fact.  And it is also \nsaid in various places in the statement that the applicant was \nwarned according to Judges' rules.   It does not appear on the \ncassettes and it won't, it cannot because the Honourable \nCommittee must understand and it was conceded by Advocate \nBrand, that the applicant had been misled.  Captain Deetliefs \ncould not have warned him because they were busy with \nclandestine discussions where Deetliefs would be assisting the \nright-wingers, why would he warn them then?\n\tIn my heads I submitted to the Honourable Committee that \nCaptain Deetliefs was a liar and that he's nothing else but that \nand that the video cassettes and the statement are proof of that.\n\tThe applicant told the Committee that at a stage he had \ndriven past Mr Mandela's home at that point and the translation it \nwould appear, the English of the applicant in the statement is \nquite clumsy, one does not know how the translation came \nthrough from the Polish to the English but he said that it was put \nto him - I don't have it here at the moment, it was asked of him \nhow he managed to obtain the address of Mr Mandela and he said \n- and he continues, I must concede, but as, and there is such \nproof, the home of Mr Mandela appeared in the Citizen \nNewspaper and according to the applicant he drove past simply \nout of curiosity.\n\tI submit to the Honourable Committee that the target which \nthey had discussed and which was pointed out by Mr Clive Derby-\nLewis was only Mr Hani and not Mr Mandela.\n\tIt was also put to the applicant during cross-examination \nand it is also supported, that there was a conspiracy to murder \nthe others whose names appeared on the list - and I refer to R4 \non page 308, where Captain Deetliefs once again - this is point 2 \non page 308, once again it is\n\t\t\"Captain\"\nI have never seen a policeman make this kind of statement, \nnonetheless\n\t\t\"Captain Cuba, do you think there is a \npossibility that others on the list could \nstill be eliminated after your arrest\"?\nthen it is\n\t\t\"Yes, they are all bastards.

One can see \nBeetge's hand, they are planning to help the right-wingers.  \n\tAnd Deetliefs will say \"They don't want to discuss it too \nopenly because it's supposed to be a secret\".  Then Deetliefs says, \nwhile they are discussing who will be the successor of Hani, \nDeetliefs says, and this is not the applicant, Deetliefs proposes \nthat Sexwale would be the possible successor.  Then Deetliefs \nsays that \"Sexwale is a bastard\", upon which the applicant \nanswers -he's sitting there and this was recorded within the \nprison, he's sitting at the table with his head turned and he says\n\t\t\"They're all bastards\".\n\tOn the same tape further on, the typed 1301, Deetliefs is \nstill in discussion with the applicant and he expresses great praise \nof Clive Derby-Lewis, that he is such a wonderful man, that \npeople trust him - this is Deetliefs speaking, and then they discuss \nthe fact that Clive Derby-Lewis was involved with the \nWitwatersrand ...[indistinct] and then the applicant makes the \nfollowing remark\n\t\t\"Clive Derby-Lewis is a good man, he is a man of \nballs - he's a guy of balls\".\nexcuse me.\n\tWhat is contained there on page 308 does not exist.

I do not want to take \nit further than that, and I would certainly not make myself guilty \nof submitting that because he lied nothing that he said here \nshould be believed.  \n\tWhat I am submitting is having regard to the fact that he is \na person who was prepared to lie under oath, who said that his \nlegal representatives were responsible for his being found guilty \nbecause they did not give him proper advice and they did not give \nhim any reasons.

So that again what we would \nappeal to the Committee to have regard to, that the matter is to \nbe decided on with a more, with respect to Counsel for the \napplicants, a thorough examination of the facts than they have set \nout in their written heads of argument and have made submissions \nhere.\n\tThe other matter Mr Chairman that we want to say about \nthese three witnesses and in this regard I would join Mr Clarke as \nthe fourth, because he falls into the same category that there \nattitude to the fundamental changes that were taking place after \n1990 and more particularly the preparatory changes to have a new \nconstitution from 1993 onwards which was being prepared at \nCODESA was absolute anathema to them.  I do not think that we \nwill be overstating the case Mr Chairman, if they are described as \na clique or small cabal of fanatics who irrespective of what the \npolicy of their political party may have been, partly as a result of \nwhat may or may not have happened in Poland as far as Mr Walus \nis concerned, partly because of deeply felt and fanatical religious \nbeliefs, they set themselves up as saviours purporting to be \nmotivated by a religion for the vast majority of the people in the \nworld preaches peace, is an excuse to commit murder by trying to \npersuade the committee that they were really after the Antichrist \nrather than the person described in evidence by Mr Jeremy Cronen \nas the person that had done so much in order to bring \nreconciliation to the country.\n\tWith those preliminary remarks I now want to turn Mr \nChairman to page 1 of our written heads and there we submit at \n4.1 that the assassination of Mr Hani was not committed on behalf \nof, or in support of the Conservative Party.  And we submit that \nthe CP had not adopted violence and most certainly not murder as \none of their means to wage its political or ideological struggle \nagainst the African National Congress, its allied organisations or \nany other organisation.  And more particularly, and this I would \nlike to add having listened to the questions by members of the \ncommittee, and particularly there was no policy of assassination \nof a political leader with a high profile, if you would add that on \npoint 4.2 Mr Chairman.  With all the difficulties that we have had \nin our violent past, Mr Chairman, the political assassination of \nhigh profile political leaders, if not entirely unknown, was almost \nunknown on the South African scene.\n\tIt has never been suggested Mr Chairman that the killing of \nthe President or the leader of a political party, or someone, \nwhatever one's views may have been about their actions, the \ncountry's problems would be solved by killing them.  When I say \nnever, we of course have the notable example in this case where \nare going to submit it was proved that it was not only Mr Hani \nthat was on the list for elimination but also Mr Mandela, Mr \nSlovo and other political figures in the country in order to create \nthe chaos that the two applicants have spoken of.  We submit that \ntheir act could not have been permitted in the course and scope of \ntheir duties because the CP had not advised, planned, directed, \ncommanded or ordered assassinations as one of it's means of \nwaging political struggle.  Mr Derby-Lewis told us what his \nduties were, Mr Walus hardly had any duties to perform in regard \nto the Conservative Party except to possibly help with elections.  \nSo that in the course and scope of their duties, advised, planned, \ndirected or commanded or ordered by the political party.\n\tIn order to answer this question we have to say, what were \ntheir duties and was it within the purview of their duty and were \nthey ordered to do it?  One can understand Mr Chairman the \nsecurity policeman who said that I was given the duty of \nsafeguarding the security of South Africa, the politicians made \nthe decisions that this is the society that they wanted, I was a \nservant, my duty was to protect people.  The politicians \nidentified, or my superiors identified Mr Goniwe to be \nassassinated, in the furtherance of my duty, I did it.  How do \nthese two applicants bring themselves, having regard to the duties \nthat they had to perform, vis a vis the Conservative party into \nsaying that it was in the course and scope of their duties as \nmembers of the CP  Mr Chairman?  There is no such evidence and \nin our submission the applicants haven't even applied their minds \nto that question and therefore on that ground amnesty should be \nrefused.\n\tBut let's go further Mr Chairman; 4.4, the CP had not given \nany express or implied authority that assassinations of political \nopponents was sanctioned and you may notice Mr Chairman that \nwe actually draw a distinction between the assassination of \npolitical opponents of high ranking and I would ask high ranking \npolitical opponents in Section 4.4 because it is in the South \nAfrican context a most unusual thing.

I can think of no assassination of a political \nleader in the country at the instance of another political party Mr \nChairman, but it may be that I had missed something along the \nway, I don't think I have.\n\tWe then go on Mr Chairman on 4.5, the applicants can not \nrely on any implied authority or perception that violence and \nmore particularly a high ranking political leader, was one of the \nmeans of struggle in view of the standing within the CP of the \nsecond applicant and the close association between the two \napplicants who are clearly on their evidence co-conspirators \nrather than inciter and incite.  \n\tNow again Mr Chairman, where did they get this authority \nfrom, we have and particularly on the section of the argument \nthat is going to be dealt with by my learned colleague, Mr \nMalindi, we will give the Committee the references Mr Chairman \nwhere this is documented, we believe that there can be no real \nanswer to the evidence that came to Dr Hartzenberg himself, from \nthe other leaders of the Conservative Party and we will submit Mr \nChairman in so far as credibility is concerned that Dr \nHartzenberg's responses in relation to violence to Mr Venter, is \nwhat the Committee should accept as the truth and not the \npathetic figure that Mr Hartzenberg cut when he gave evidence \nbefore the Committee trying to explain this.  \n\tLet me just say briefly Mr Chairman that for him to have \nsaid that -\n \"I as the deputy leader said a few days after the \nmurder that we were the people with the moral high \nground, we did not use violence, nor assassination...\"\nto come here and try and excuse it on the basis that political \nleaders would not come out with it openly, is a pathetic attempt \nby a discredited politician to help one of his fellow party members \nof a discredited political party out of the difficulty in getting \namnesty.  \n\tAnd what we submit in 4.6 Mr Chairman or 4.5, we will \nrefer to the passages and there isn't only one, such passage, but \nparticularly one of the  passages in answer to the committee \nmember Advocate Potgieter which makes it quite clear on the \nevidence of both of them that they were co-conspirators planning \nthis together and there was no element of inciter and incitee. \n\tWe draw attention Mr Chairman that the word order was \nintroduced into Mr Derby-Lewis' vocabulary after the Max du \nPreez show was shown to him where Mr du Preez offered some \nlegal advice which he took with both hands, not legal advice - \noffered the possibility that Walus may have an additional defence, \nthat it was taken with both hands and Counsel for the applicants \nused the word order intermittently in the heads of argument \nwithout having regard to the evidence that there was this co-\nconspiratorial relationship rather than the one of inciter and \nincitee.  \n\tAnd we say in 4.6 that there are no reasonable grounds \nupon which the applicants can claim that they believed themselves \nto be acting in the course and scope of their duties, and within \nthe scope of their express or implied authority, we will rely \nheavily upon the position of Mr Derby-Lewis' in the Conservative \nParty and if Mr Walus was a co-conspirator and not an incitee \nthen it would follow in his case as well.\n\tBut there is an overwhelming probability that people as \nclose to one another as this, and we submit that Mr Walus would \nnot have given the Committee an impression that he's a weakling \nor a yes-man to anybody's will.  He bragged about his prowess in \nthe statement recorded by Mr Deetliefs and Mr Beetge and \nnothing in his demeanour or in his actions or his absence of any \nremorse on his part and the manner in which he dealt with himself \nin this court, that before this Committee, thus could not have \ngiven the impression that he's a weak person that was mislead by \nMr Derby-Lewis.",

Now I want to \nmake clear Mr Chairman that we submit that the conflicts of the \npast were coming to an end.  Counsel for the applicants said but \nlook what Mr Visser told us that Gen Viljoen was planning, that \nwas, we submit, clearly a conditional possibility, if there was not \na settlement.  As it turned out, General Viljoen himself subscribed \nto the settlement, therefore what might have happened according \nto the plans of the Volksfront at that stage which were not \npublicly known for which the applicants do not purport to have \nbeen acting on behalf of, can be left out of account, we submit.\n\tWhat is relevant and the evidence stands uncontradicted, it \nwas put down in a written statement supported by annexures \nwhich are before you as Exhibit, it's Bundle B which contains, it's \na carefully prepared statement and practically all the statements \nin it are supported by  what Mr Jeremy Cronin now says Mr Chris \nHani said at the time, but we were careful to go to the public \nrecord as to what Mr Hani was saying at the time and what he \nwas saying was obviously gaining ground and obviously not to the \nliking of the fanatics like the two applicants, Mrs Derby-Lewis \nand Mr Clarke.  \n\tAnd it is that, and when their party in April 1993 was party \nto those negotiations, Mr Chairman, how could they believe that \nkilling one of the negotiators and the general secretary of one of \nthe negotiating parties at that process where their own party was \nparticipating be in the course and scope of their duties or that \nthey had the express or implied authority?\n\tIt can be tested in this way Mr Chairman, there was Mr \nLangley there if I remember correctly, there was Mr Hartzenberg \nthere, pride of place for the television cameras of the world \nnegotiating for a settlement, these applicants say that whilst they \nwere in CODESA negotiating a settlement, these two gentlemen \nbelieved that they had express or implied authority from them to \nkill on of the top leaders of the alliance working to bring about \ndemocratic changes.\n\tAgain Mr Chairman, I must refer to these four, and I \ninclude Mr Clarke, to this day Mr Chairman they speak about a \ncommunist party take-over.  They do not accept that we had a \ndemocratic election.  To them democracy means something else \nentirely.  I mention this because we will make some references to \nit in greater detail as to whether reconciliation is about to take \nplace by people who still speak about a communist take-over \nwhen 62 or 63% of the population of this county voted for the \ngovernment that is in power.  They may be fanatics, they may be \nunreasonable, they may be beyond the pale, but none of those \nentitle them to say that they believed that they had express or \nimplied authority.  There was nothing happening at the time to \nwhich they had to react by killing a top leader.\n\tThen we say in 4.8 Mr Chairman that the Act was not \nproportional to the objective pursued in their own version and on \ntheir own version they sought to create chaos, expecting hundreds \nif not thousands of people to be killed during a race war in the \nhope that the riot would stage a coup.  This has been canvassed, I \ndo not want to take up very much more time on it at this stage, it \nwas very important for the proportionality.  But I was actually \nsomewhat surprised by the Counsel for the applicant, Mr \nChairman that the killing of Pieterse led to chaos.  I don't know \nwhy he said that, I would have thought that that would have been \na warning to his client about irrational killing of people because \nwe know that hundreds if not thousands died as a direct or \nindirect result of the wanton killing of Master Petersen on the \n16th of June 1976.\n\tAnd in 4.9 Mr Chairman the relationship between the \nobjective pursued and the act is director or proximate, \nparticularly as on their own version they had not planned or even \ninformed the CP who they claim to have represented or any \nelements, to any elements of the right.  I think that the members \nof the Committee are aware to what we are referring to in this \nregard and I will take it no further at this stage.\n\tNow in relation to full disclosure Mr Chairman, we submit \nthat the applicants have not made a full disclosure of all the \nrelevant facts and have been untruthful relating to when the \nconspiracy to kill Chris Hani was first mooted or entered into; \nwho were the victims of the conspiracy; who had become members \nof the conspiracy and more particularly Mrs Gaye Derby-Lewis \nand others who had procured the murder weapon; who procured \nthe murder weapon and the reasons thereof.  Details of this are \ngiven in the rest of the heads of argument.  \n\tIt is further submitted that the grant of amnesty to the \napplicants would be inappropriate and not in accordance with the \nobjective of the Commission to promote national unity and \nreconciliation in that the act or offence was committed during the \ntime when the country was at its most sensitive stage towards \nbuilding peace, reconciliation and democracy.  The offence was of \nsuch gravity that the chaos envisaged to result from the \nassassination could have led to the death of many innocent \ncivilians.  \n\tWell may I pause here and again refer to the evidence of Mr \nJeremy Cronin as to how near we were to a civil war and the real \nchaos that had been envisaged and the evidence that had it not \nbeen for the leadership of Mr Mandela then as President of the \nANC and Mr Tokyo Sexwale as the Transvaal Chairman of the \nANC, there would so easily have been a blood bath and a race war \nin South Africa.",

Yes it may well be but there \nare two inherent improbabilities in Mr Clarke's evidence who \ndenies that anything like that happened. \n\tFirstly why should Mr Visser have gone to Mr Clarke and \nasked Mr Clarke and Mr Roodt to apply for amnesty?  \n\tSecondly, if Mr Clarke is telling the truth that Mr Visser \nwas, he's the fault ..(indistinct) and that the relationship between \nthe two of them had soured by the time of the commission of the \nmurder, why Mr Clarke on his own version disclosed to Mr Visser \nthat there was compromising information in his computer's hard \ndisks?  Since when on the general and particular probabilities \ndoes a witness confide that sort of information?\n\t If we turn to paragraph 5 of page 3 Mr Chairman \n\t\"It is further submitted that the grant of amnesty to the \napplicants will be inappropriate and not in accordance with \nthe objective of the Commission to promote National unity \nand reconciliation in that the offence was committed during \nthe time when the country was at the most sensitive stage \nwith the building of peace, reconciliation and democracy, \nthe offence was of such a gravity that the chaos envisaged \nto result from the assassination would have led to the death \nof many innocent civilians.  According to the applicants the \nstruggle continues and it cannot be discounted that they \nremain committed with the objective of creating large scale \nchaos which will create conditions for a coup d'etat\".\n\tBut now Mr Chairman, amnesty is provided in relation in \nrelation to coup d'etat in paragraph E and by the usual argument \nof that which included excludes other possibilities.  It was only \namnesty to be given any person in the performance of a coup \nd'etat to take over the government of any former state or any \nattempt thereto.  So this was a coup d'etat, it was not for the \npurposes of preserving law and order.\n\tWe turn in paragraph 6 to  6.1  The failure to make full \ndisclosures.  We submit that Mr Derby-Lewis has lied about the \ninvolvement of Mrs Derby-Lewis in the compilation of the hit list \nand the reasons therefor.  \n\tDerby-Lewis testified that he first saw the list of the nine \nnames in Cape Town when Mrs Derby-Lewis showed it to him as \npart of the gravy train story which was to be used by Dr \nHartzenberg in Parliament. We submit that that's false Mr \nChairman. This could not be true because in January 1993 when \nMrs Derby-Lewis telephoned Arthur Kemp and sent him a list of \n90 names it was after she and Derby-Lewis had discussed it and \ndecided that unless something dramatic was done the country \nwould be controlled by a communist.  \n\"Clive and I therefore highlighted the names of \npeople whom we believed to be the enemies of South \nAfrica\".  \n\tThis comes in R4.251, paragraph 43.1, we are going to \nargue Mr Chairman in due course that their statements are \nadmissible as the ruling of the Committee indicated and that \nweight should be attached to it.  We will refer you, not to \ngeneralities or the cross-examination put to Mr De Waal, but to \nher own statements that she is unable to deny that this is what she \nsaid and that she made that freely and voluntarily despite certain \ndiscomforts that she says she suffered under. If that statement of \nMrs Derby-Lewis is admitted and what we say is that we must \ntake it together with the probabilities; the probabilities of this \nclose union between these two persons and having regard to the \ncharacter of Mrs Derby-Lewis, we are not dealing here with a \ncompliant housewife, we are dealing with a high profile \npropagandist in the Patriot who in her exaggerations and fanatical \nstatements probably has no equal and who has a mind of her own. \n No serious step in relation to the preparation of this list would \nhave been without her consent, and what we say at the bottom of \npage 4, 'on 29 April 1993 whilst in detention, Mrs Derby-Lewis \nwas shown three pages compiled as the hit list and recognised \nthem as the list of names and addresses that she had given to her \nhusband.  This is evidence that Mrs Derby-Lewis knew of what \npurpose Mr Derby-Lewis needed the list.  \n\tOf course Mr Chairman, I'll remind you at this stage that \nshe denied flatly before the Judge President of the Transvaal as it \nwas then known, that she had given the list to anyone, she made \nup a fabric of lies about it being left on her coffee table with \ncopies of the Patriot which Mr Walus may have mistakenly taken.\n\tWhen Mrs Derby-Lewis compiled the original list of 19 \nnames, she knew that the people whom she and Derby-Lewis \nconsidered to be enemies of South Africa were to be murdered, \nthat after she had received the list of 9 names, Chris Hani was \ntargeted for elimination, that the houses of the people identified \nfor elimination would be reconnoitred and that Walus the one who \nwas going to assassinate Chris Hani and we give you the passages \nin R4 Mr Chairman.  When cross-examined on why she needed \naddresses of certain people that she could either telephone or \nvisit their offices, Mrs Derby-Lewis gave some preposterous \nanswers.  Although she didn't think Hani would give her a private \ninterview in his home, she still wanted the address so that she \ncould see the way he lived.  The answer is absurd, if she was not \ngoing to be allowed into the house in the first place.  \n\tMrs Derby-Lewis gave totally unsatisfactory and evasive \nanswers to members of the Committee Mr Chairman about why \nshe would have wanted to interview certain people who appear on \nthe list and as to why she didn't visit certain journalists or \ntelephoned them at their homes instead of seeking their addresses \nthrough Mr Kemp.  \n\tWe give you the references; it was a long exchange Mr \nChairman and we submit that it bristles with improbabilities.

They wanted an order and in answer to \nJudge Wilson as to why Walus marked it 1 to 9, is a ridiculous \nanswer, with respect.  You'll recall that it was in order to speak \non the telephone by number, and I think it was the chairperson \nthat asked well if there was only going to be one, why talk in \nnumbers anyway? So that a list is some evidence that this was or \nwas intended to be a wider conspiracy than we have heard of \nhere.\n\tThe other of course is, criminal investigators in the \nadministration of justice thrive on it.  Many of the people that \nplan similar crimes are just stupid.  In the Goniwe matter they \ndropped a name plate, otherwise the Goniwe people would just \nhave disappeared for ever.  It is the sort of thing, the sort of \noversight or the sort of conduct which makes investigation \npossible.  But certainly what it is not, is a list for journalistic \npurposes because we have the evidence of  Mrs Derby-Lewis in \nthe criminal trial.  \n\tWe will refer you to the passage Mr Chairman where His \nLordship Mr Justice Eloff holds the evidence to be highly \nimprobable.  However in that criminal trial there was an onus \nwhich had to be discharged and probabilities were not enough.  \nThe Committee here, and this is why she could not be convicted \non the second count of conspiring to kill the people on the list, \nbut here we had the additional evidence, their own statements, we \nhave the evidence here of what Mr Derby-Lewis admits to doing \nwhich was not before His Lordship Mr Justice Eloff and I would \nsubmit that although the Committee will accept the learned \nJudge's view that it was highly improbable, what has come forth \nsince, that Mr Derby-Lewis indeed had this list, that he did get it \nfrom his wife, that he did give it to Walus, that he and Walus, on \ntheir own version had planned the assassination, so that claiming \nthat this was an innocent list on the probabilities was unlikely for \nJudge Eloff correctly, for this Committee it is beyond reasonable \ndoubt.  \n\tThat is the submission that we make in relation to the list \nand Mr Derby-Lewis lied about it, Mr Walus lied about the \npurpose of the list, Mrs Derby-Lewis lied in relation to the \npurposes of the list.  Therefore in relation to lack of full \ndisclosure, if our submission is well-founded that all three of \nthem knew that there were to be more than one victim and at least \nanother appears in the list of nine, then each one of them has \nfailed to disclose the truth.\n\tLet us take it on the probabilities.  After all we only have \nthe wrong-doers testimony to work on and it may well be that \nnone of them was expressly prepared to say or Walus was not \nprepared to say that I knew that this was drawn up by Mrs Derby-\nLewis and I knew that it was a hit list for the nine, if the \ninference can be drawn, and we submit clearly that it can, that all \nthree of them knew what they were doing and what they were \nsaying about the nine people on the list, there has not been full \ndisclosure, that neither of them is entitled to amnesty and it is a \npity that the safeguards of double jeopardy, Mrs Derby-Lewis \ndoes not have to answer any more to Mr Hani's death in a court \nof law.",

            "Although that is a theoretical possibility, the \nadmissions of Mrs Derby-Lewis in R4 exclude it \nbecause she says, I can read the passages now - 251 \nof R4 Mr Chairman.\n\"In January 1963 I telephoned Arthur Kemp at the\nCitizen in Johannesburg and said I was going to send\nhim a list of names and that I wanted a description of\ntheir houses and addresses.  This was done after much \nserious thought and because Clive and I felt that \nunless something dramatic was done the country \nwould be controlled by the communists\".\n\t\tNow may I just for one moment deal with the \nquestion of admissibility and weight at this stage?  This is \ncompletely consistent with what all of them said.  So how \ndoes it help the applicants to say that words were put into \nthe mouths of Mrs Derby-Lewis or Walus or Mr Derby-\nLewis? \n\"Clive and I therefore highlighted the names of people \nwhom we believed to be the enemies of South Africa. \n Certain names were added to the list I sent to Arthur \nsuch as Justice Goldstone and certain newspaper \npeople.  Goldstone's address was needed to determine \nwhere he lived because I wanted to do an article on \nhow he who helped to break down the Group Areas \nAct was now living in a white are far away from the \nresults of his 1984 Govender Judgment'.\nNow it also says something about Mrs Derby-Lewis Mr Chairman, \nnot an unformed person, she knows the name of the case.  \n\t'The journalists address were requested because I wanted to \nwrite about them about their attitudes towards the CP.  I \nasked Mr Pik Botha's address because there strong rumours \nthat he owned property overseas.  This has been reported in \nthe in the Afrikaner newspaper and perhaps the company \nwhich owned his property here, if a company owned it, \nwould be the same company which owned the overseas \nproperties.  When I asked Arthur on the phone about \nsupplying the addresses, I did not go into specifics.  He is \npolitically shrewd and I believe that he felt that there was \nno need to spell out why we needed the names.  After all we \nwere on the phone'.\nNow is not that the statement of a conspirator, is that the \nstatement of a person who wanted to write about the gravy train, \nabout which she had already written before and had shouted it \nfrom the roof tops?  Why would she not want to discuss it on the \ntelephone now.  I'm reminded the clandestine way in which Mr \nClarke has bothered to take it to the Rotunda and to hand it over \nto him in his absence or out of his hearing on his evidence if he is \nto be believed.  \tThat's not a list but we go further.  On page \n252, paragraph 44, certain of the names on the list we believe to \nbe the enemies of South Africa.  \n\t'Clive and I had vague plans in the beginning that some sort \nof arrangement should be made to liquidate one or perhaps \nmore leaders of the ANC and the SACP Communist Party.  \nThe people on this list whom I believe to be the enemies of \nSouth Africa were the participants in 'Operation Vula'.  \nYou've heard the echo yesterday from Mr Clarke who were never \nprosecuted by the government and member of the ANC and SACP \nCommunist Party.  Some of the names were Maharaj, Hani, \nMandela Kasrils, Naidoo, Ramaphosa and Slovo.  \n\t'Clive and Kuba decided on Chris Hani to be eliminated \nbecause of his particularly brutal record and his position as \nchairman of the SA Communist Party which they believed \nnever should have been unbanned.  Clive and Kuba wanted a \ndescription of the residences and I can only assume that this \nwas to determine what sort of security surrounded the \nhouses.  I simply asked Arthur what was asked of me; I'm \nnot a logistics person, nor was I present at any discussions \nin '93 between Kuba and Clive about logistics', \nnot about the conspiracy, just the logistics.  \n\t'It does not  mean to say I am denying that discussions \nbetween the two of them were not going on.  Clive told me \nsometime in March that he and Kuba had decided about \nChris Hani as the person to be eliminated.  I don't know \nwhat Clive and Kuba discussed about the other enemies \nmentioned on the list, Arthur Kemp phoned ..' \nmay I pause here.  \n\tHer previous statements make it quite clear that Hani was \nnot alone, there was a whole list, what she says here,\n\t'Arthur Kemp phoned me to say that he had got some of the \naddresses I had asked for and I asked him to fax them to \nme.  I asked  him to fax the street address and the \ndescription of the residence referring to the ANC/SAC \npeople and the description of the residences referring to the \nANC/SAC people'.  \nI suppose she didn't want a description of Mr Justice Goldstones \nif she's telling the truth about the article and not if he was not on \nthe hit list, it's possible. And the reporters that she wanted to - it \nmay be that there may have been people there as a camouflage, \npossibly but there is no doubt about the description of the \nresidences referring to the ANC/SAC people and if we look at the \nexhibit with the nine names on, I can't remember whether \neveryone was an ANC/SACP person but certainly the majority, \nbut with these fanatics Mr Chairman, who is an ANC/SACP \nperson isn't a matter of nice distinction as far as they are \nconcerned on the evidence I would submit, but anyone who is not \nfanatically preoccupied with herrenvolk ideas is a communist or \nan ANC person.\n\tThen on page 253 that, \n\t'Arthur and I met at the Rotunda where Arthur gave me the \nnames and the few other clippings for which I had asked \nhim and Arthur told me that he was resigning from the \nCitizen and that he felt tired and was sick of ...(indistinct), \nArthur said that he would be doing other things with his life \nnot connected with this, generally such as statements, \nbusiness and other...(indistinct).  I presume Arthur wanted \nto seem me rather than just faxing the list because he saw \nthe implications of the list and felt he should not fax it to \nme.'\nNow isn't that a conspiratorial way of dealing with things? I will \ndeal with it in due course but what I want to emphasise at this \nstage, that where we have an improbable story told in the \nSupreme Court where ridiculous explanations are given by the \nwitness in the witness box and where we do know that the \nhandwriting on the list is that of Walus, we know that Mr Derby-\nLewis and Mr Walus had discussion on the list, that they were the \nones that planned the murder, it becomes proof beyond reasonable \ndoubt on Mrs Derby-Lewis' false evidence, coupled with the \nstatements that she made which have not been shown to have been \nmade under any sort of pressure, not only that what the applicants \nhave to show that her treatment was such that she was in due \ncourse to lie about herself, about Walus and about her husband, \nshe specifically disavowed any such happening in relation to her. \nShe was specifically asked and we will further commit it to the \npassage by a member of the committee, and I have a graphic \nrecollection of it, \n\t'Despite all these things that happened to you..', \nif I remember correctly, it was the Chairman but I may be \nmistaken.\n\t'Did you tell them anything which was untrue?'\nand the answer was no.  And let us remind ourselves how \nuntruthful she was in relation to the portions that she learned \nwere not on the video which was available.  She blue hot and cold \nand we refer to the cross-examination and these are the passages \nwhich are - if I could refer you to page 402 of R4, it's the \ncontinued portion, R4 continued, 402.  Well could we start with \nItem number 47.\n\t'On the Sunday I saw Kuba's photograph in the newspaper \nand recognised him at once.  I was very shocked but in my \nheart not at all surprised.  There had been a lot of talk \nbetween right wingers of solutions to the problems in the \ncountry'.    \nThis is the evidence her.\n\t'Clive said that he had discussed these things with Kuba'.  \nWell that's true as a fact and of overwhelming probability that her \nloving husband would have told his loving wife.  \n\t'Clive was upset and I asked him what he was going to do'. \nA highly probable conversation after the wife party to a \nconspiracies was speaking to her husband after they found out \nthat the one of the victims of their conspiracy had been murdered.\n\t'He said that during the discussions with Kuba they had \nmentioned such a thing like Hani's death, he said that he \nhadn't thought that Kuba would do such a thing at all'.\nWell it's partly true but certainly not the statement of a person \nwho is being coerced to give evidence against her husband or for \nany other purpose.  \n\t'He did say that he couldn't understand why Kuba had been \nso stupid to drive around so obvious, Kuba was supposed to \nchange the number plates.  He did admit to me however \nthey had discussed it.  Clive did however say it looked like \na set-up, seeing Kuba was caught so quickly.  We suspected \nAPLA, we talked about Hani suddenly talking peace when \nhe was the manifestation of the resistance.  Hani criticised \nthe PAC in the week or two prior to the killing.  Clive \nthought that either APLA, the government or someone was \nbehind it, as it didn't should like Kuba who would go into a \nsituation head-on.  I asked Clive about the gun but he did \nsay he couldn't tell me where he had got the gun from'.\nNow one does not dismiss that sort of evidence corroborative of \nthe overwhelming probability found by Judge Eloff even without \nthis.\n\tThen on top of page 6, during the criminal trial, Mrs Derby-\nLewis had given one other reason for the list to be the purpose to \nwrite a book with Mrs Ida Parker in addition to the list being for \nthe purposes of conducting interviews or for use by Dr \nHartzenberg.  The court held that Mrs Derby-Lewis was not \ntruthful about the list and that here explanations were far fetched \nand that is the reference Mr Chairman to the criminal record.\n\tIn her statement during detention Mrs Derby-Lewis says she \ndid not show the list to anyone in Cape Town including Mr \nDerby-Lewis, that is in the statement and we give  you the \nreference, I submit that it's a correct reference, I don't want to \nread them unless members of the Committee want me to.  Her \nevidence before the Committee that she placed this list on Dr \nHartzenberg's table and the evidence of Dr Hartzenberg that you \nsaw documents on his table in Parliament, placed there by Mrs \nDerby-Lewis must be regarded as false.  Derby-Lewis is correct \nwhen he says that he took responsibility for compiling the list \nwhen he made his statement in detention in order to protect his \nwife.  His wife needed protection because the list was a hit list \nand he and Walus had already been arrested.",

Our \nposition is still that we would like to cross-examine the \napplicants, most certainly if it is intended to call Mr Coetzee as a \nwitness and we would like the Committee to make a ruling on \nthat.  There are a couple of reasons Mr Chairman why I submit  \ncross-examination should be allowed. Firstly the version of Mr \nCoetzee has never been tested in a scenario where any other \nperson has admitted any involvement in the murder of Kondile and \nthat in itself makes these hearings completely different to any of \nthe other hearings that have taken place relating to this incident \nand I submit that there are various aspects on which Mr Coetzee's \nevidence at this stage, considering the new allegations or the new \nfacts presented by these applicants can assist this committee to \ncome to the truth.  I may just mention one fact for instance is the \nincrimination of a Mr Roy Otto, that's the first time that we hear \nof his involvement.  Now other than the fact that this person is \ndeceased, Mr Chairman, the facts of the matter are that there is \ndocumentation available which suggested that Mr Otto was on \nleave at the time, in fact had been on leave for a month and a \nhalf, which gives credence to the suggestion that there is \nsomething sinister in the choice of a dead person to be the person \nshooting or committing the actual killing.

An employee of the Cape Town \nCity Council, John Jacobs, was on duty that Thursday evening of the \n30th of December 1993.  He was patrolling the streets to see \nwhether all the street lights were burning.  He and a colleague were \ndriving alone Lower Main Road in Observatory from north to south. \n As they arrived at the corner of Lower Main Road and Station \nRoad, they heard sounds like gun fire or fire crackers and saw three \nmen emerge.  Since they wanted to turn into Station Road, they saw \nthree men in a car, against the one way, in Station Road, driving in \ntheir direction.  They were then forced to wait for this motor \nvehicle.  Mr Jacobs heard gun shots at the very moment when \nsomeone emerged from the door of the facility on the corner of \nStation Road and Lower Main Road.  He saw the end of a rifle \nsticking slightly out of the back passenger window of the vehicle.  It \nwas clear to him that someone was firing from the motor vehicle at \nthis person.  He had fallen flat in his motor vehicle and then when he \nlifted his head again, he saw the person who had emerged from the \ndoor of the corner facility lying in the storm water drain in Station \nRoad.\n\tNow, that version doesn't exactly correspond with what you \nobserved, do you agree with that?",

And I will just read to you again what he \nsays.\n\tI am reading from paragraph three, the sub-heading \"the \nincident\".  I had been on duty at Machados restaurant on the night \nof 30 December 1993, when the incident in question took place.  \nThe restaurant had been quite full that evening, being the festive \nseason and everyone was in a jolly mood.\n\tAfter the restaurant had closed, the owner Joe Cerqueira, his \nbrother and another colleague whose name I can't remember, had \nbeen clearing the restaurant and set about preparing the restaurant \nfor the next day's business when we heard what we assumed was a \ncar backfiring in the road outside.   This sound continued and we \nthought it may also be the sound of fireworks thrown by some \npartygoers outside.\n\tI was the first to walk out of the restaurant to investigate and \nwas followed by my colleagues.  I saw individuals coming out of the \nHeidelberg Tavern, which is located next to Machados restaurant.  \nThey were making their way to a dark coloured car.  I saw what I \nagain thought was flares or fireworks and then noticed these \nindividuals were firing automatic machine gun fire in all directions.\n\tOnce they spotted me and my colleagues, they fired in our \ndirection.  In the resulting confusion, we pushed our way back into \nthe restaurant and took cover as best we could.  I remember lying \nflat on the floor of the restaurant.  \n\tOn page 74 at the top - once the firing had stopped, I ran out \nof the restaurant, it was at this stage that I saw the deceased, Joe \nCerqueira lying, dying in the gutter.  He had been shot in the chest.  \nThe result was complete mayhem as people ran around in shock, \nshouting for help.  It was only at this stage, when I knelt down next \nto the deceased, that I realised that I had been shot in the leg. \n\tMy thoughts at that stage were about Joe Cerqueira and I \nremember thinking Joe, you can't die now.  The exact details of what \nhappened after that, are not clear to me.\n\tSo, in that statement too, he doesn't mention you specifically, \nalthough he may have meant when he said once they, that is now the \n...

            "Right, thank you.  \n\t\"Who was Bernadette Langford before?  A talented young \nlady on the brink of her career.  The eldest daughter of \nAndrea Langford, sister to three sisters and a brother, loved \nby her family, friends and all who were privileged to know \nher.\n\tOn the 9th of December 1993, she had received her higher \ndiploma in Education post graduate for secondary education.  \nShe completed the prescribed course in the following teaching \nsubjects  Art, school counselling and guidance.  She could \nalso teach through the medium of Afrikaans higher and \nEnglish higher.\n\tSince the very young age of seven, she was capable of \nattaining the goals she reached for, such as ballet with \nhonours and scripture exams with distinction.  Besides her \nschool studies, which later included drama, this pattern was \npursued while at University.  Her first three years were at \nRhodes University where she received her BA degree in fine \nart and psychology.\n\tAnd at the same time, she was a keen sportswoman.  That was \nin volley ball.  She also completed an advance course in \ndeportment, beauty rooting, fashion and photographic \nmodelling.  She had also done a St John's ambulance course.  \nBernadette had one desire, and that was to enrich our society \nwith her abilities.\n\tShe had a great love for children and a compassion for the \nmisunderstood.  She was working on a casual basis at Edgars, \nAdderley Street, while waiting for a reply from her \napplications for a teaching post.\n\tShe undertook to care for the family and had plans to support \nher brother's education.  She had hopes of raising a family of \nher own one day.  \n\tThe incident.  On the 30th of December 1993, Bernadette's \nfriends decided to stop at the Heidelberg Tavern in \nObservatory for eats and while there, she was gunned down \nwith automatic gun fire, according to reports.\n\tExtent of injuries.  During the early hours of the 31st of \nDecember 1993, Bernadette had lost her life.  She, who \nshowed mercy to others, was not given that chance.   An \ninnocent human being\".  \nI approve of the statements made and the copies, I can give to you.",

Though the last memory of her causes us \nto sorrow, not as the world, but with the hope of everlasting \nlife.  I know if she was here, she would want us to hold onto \nthe truth.\n\tThe loss to the family came at a time when funds were \nexhausted.  I, her mother, had to come up to Cape Town and \nidentify her and do the necessary arrangements for her burial \nin Port Elizabeth.  This was very difficult at the time as I was \nunemployed, due to the fact that I had given up my work the \nprevious year, to sort out our family matters after her father's \nsudden death due to respiratory failure.\n\tHis small business had to be shut down and I had not \nrecovered from these losses, when this tragedy struck the \nfamily.  Family and friends rallied around at the time, I thank \nGod for them.  I was told that a fund had been established to \nassist the families, but this came to nought - up to this very \nhour, I have never been assisted in any way.\n\tI feel I have the right to ask what is the right of human life, is \nit not to be given a free chance to live?  This is what I would \nsay if I were given the opportunity to make the statement.\n\tThe past four years have been exceptionally difficult since \nBernadette's death.  As a result, we had to deal with many \nfrustrations such as continually being asked about our feelings \nand our view concerning the way in which she died because \nthe community where I live, could not accept the way in which \nshe died.\n\tMy relatives all suffered emotionally because of the trauma \nand they knew that because of our culture in which we care \nfor the one who cares for you, this was not going to happen.  \nI asked God for inner strength and the courage to forgive \nwhich I did.\n\tI had to remember to lead by example, which the rest of the \nfamily would follow.  The hardships have not ended because \nlife has become more expensive.  I have a casual job since last \nyear, which is a blessing in a small way.\n\tThe men who shot Bernadette, have to understand that we \nforgave them as a family, but this shouldn't prevent justice \nfrom taking place.  I wish to say to the Truth and \nReconciliation Commission and all who are assembled here for \nthe Heidelberg Tavern hearing, man can do what is humanly \npossible, but God can do the impossible to reconcile man to \nGod.  To the ones who sent you, you planted the seed and \nwatered it, you saw it grow, so you are very much part of the \nend result, but I tell you too, there is a way to find peace of \nmind - may God grant you the wisdom to understand.",

I have forgiven them so I \nwill explain that line.\n\tI will just go on from here.

If they can be brought here or at a \nseparate hearing, we will be satisfied as I said.\n\tAnd as I will say to the applicants, as I heard all the time, \nthey acted under orders which I understand.  I too, act under orders \nas I sit here now, just speaking directly to you because I firmly \nwould like to believe that we all do believe there is a God above our \nheads.\n\tIf I can be allowed to say this, and because I believe that God \nis God and I act under His orders and for me, His orders are to say \nto you and to all here, yes, I have forgiven you.  I will not oppose \nyour amnesty because who am I, I am not your judge.  I can never \njudge you, but there is a way to find the freedom more than amnesty \ncan free you from. And that is if you give your hearts to Him.  And \nyou truly believe that He did send his Son for all of us here present, \nnot only for a sinner, but for all and you give your hearts to Him, \nyou will find the peace that I have found, with which I can say to \nyou I have forgiven you and I will not oppose your amnesty.

Nothing has changed, I still feel \nexactly the same way and I do forgive you because my High \nCommand, demonstrated to me how to do that by forgiving his \nkillers.\n\tI want to tell you who Lindi was.  She was known as Lindiwe \nby her Xhosa friends.  Lindi was a true child of Africa.  She was \nhappiest hiking in the mountains, riding a horse with her dog out in \nthe countryside.  She was just finishing a Bachelor of Science in \nCivil Engineering and had spent a lot of time designing and thinking \nabout how it would be possible to improve the infrastructure in \nplaces like Khayelitsha, so that running water and waterborne \nsewerage would be available, to people who have been oppressed \nand discriminated against.\n\tShe had spent her vacations with one of the big engineering \ncompanies in the Western Cape, and during lunch time the black men \nwould come and tell her about their lives.  She would come home in \nthe evenings, and tell me the tragic stories of hopelessness and the \ndespair that they felt in never being able to get further than being \nlabourers.\n\tShe understood that.  She wept to know that that was \nhappening in her country.  She helped me to understand how subtle \nmy prejudice and bias and racial discrimination was.  But it was \nnothing blatant, it was in the very, very subtle fibres of my being.  \nShe helped me to understand that.\n\tShe was totally willing to treat everyone as an equal and she \ndid that openly and freely.  Her black friends were as important to \nher as her white friends.  \tLindiwe could have been your friend. \n You did your own cause immeasurable harm by killing her.  She was \ntotally opposed to violence.  She was a gentle person who cared for \nnot only the people, not only the little people, but the animals and \nthe flowers, the ecology of our country and the world.\n\tAs a medical person, I had to go straight back into the wards \nof Groote Schuur and treat your colleagues who had been shot and I \nneeded to do that without showing any bitterness or resentment.  \nGod gave me that grace.  \tI think the reason that I am here, \nhave been here through this week and particularly today which is \nvery important to me, is to tell you that on that day you ripped my \nheart out.  Lindi was one of the most precious people and I am \nbiased because she was my daughter, that this country could have \nproduced.\n\tI resent being called a victim, I have a choice in the matter.  I \nam a survivor.  Lindi was a victim, she had no choice.  I have just \nhad major surgery, which I trace as a direct result to the stress and \ntrauma that resulted out of the Heidelberg incident.   It has been \ndemonstrated that cancer of the colon is something that results from \ntremendous stress.  So first my heart was ripped out, and now half \nof my gut.  \n\tI am happy that you are well, I hope that emotionally and \npsychologically you can be well because my greatest concern is that \nyou have been programmed killers, you repeatedly said that you \nwere acting under orders from your high command.\n\tYou could not tell us how you felt which indicates to me that \npossibly you have been trained not to feel and I can see that that \nwould be important in a killing machine, to be unable to feel, but \njust to carry out orders indiscriminately.   And that is my greatest \nfear.\n\tI have no objection to amnesty for you, but we know there are \nenough indiscriminate killers on our streets and my fear is that we \nhave three more who are capable, because of their programming to \ndo exactly the same thing once you are released.\n\tI wished that it could be otherwise and perhaps with time and \ncounselling things can be otherwise, and I would wish that that is \npossible and that it is made available to you as it has been made \navailable to us, to have counselling for the tremendous trauma that \nwe have been through and I am sure you have been through trauma \nas well.\tBoth through the incident and through your own \nexperiences, which Lindiwe would have been delighted to hear and I \nwould be also interested in hearing how you experienced oppression \npersonally.  I have experienced oppression as a white woman and I \nam sure the oppression that you have experienced, may be much \nworse.  But I would like to know the details because that is what \nLindi would have wanted to know too.\n\tWe came here hoping to hear the truth about who the people \nin high command were who organised this whole dastedly affair.   I \nam not convinced that that truth has come out and until it is, and \ndoes come out, I am not happy that you could just disappear into the \nwoodwork.\n\tI know that it must be terribly frightening to reveal who the \nhigh command is because your own lives are in jeopardy if you do \nget amnesty, and I appreciate that it must be very, very frightening.\n\tI thank you for being able to look me in the eye and for \nhaving to hear my story.

            "Mr Chairman, I just want to go through the \npiece of my position and feelings regarding this amnesty application.\n\tFrom the 30th of December 1993, my life has never been the \nsame for obvious reasons, being in a wheelchair, having lost the use \nof my legs due to the fact that I was shot in cold blood, at point \nblank range by the three applicants.  There is a lot a person can deal \nwith and I thank God for the courage given to me and that got me \nwhere I am now.\n\tIf it was not for that courage and strength and my optimism, I \nwould not have been here today.  It is however, made very difficult \nwhen you have root nerve pain and various other forms of pain on a \ndaily basis, pains that you can hardly explain to somebody, that I \nwould never have had if this did not happen.\n\tI have lost a kidney and various parts of my intestines as well, \nas a result of the shooting.  This has been the reason and the cause \nwhy I initially ended up in hospital for several months and have \nsubsequently been in hospital again a couple of times, because of \nvarious complications.\n\tNobody will ever know what it is like, what suffering a person \nhas to go through until it has happened to you.  I would like to have \neach of the perpetrators look me in the eye and choose whether they \nwould not mind having a rifle stuck in their spines and the trigger \nbeing pulled on them in cold blood, to leave them emotionally and \nphysically scarred and disabled as I have been or would they rather \nstay in jail and serve their sentences for the crimes that they \ncommitted?\n\tThere was a freedom fight in this country for many years \nbefore, our current President, Nelson Mandela was set free in the \nearly 1990's, in fact I think it was 1991.  He became President of \nthis country due to the democratic elections that was held in April of \n1994, only four months after this horrific attack was launched on us.\n\tAll political parties had by that time, come to agreement \nalready that they are on the road to democracy in this country, \nincluding the perpetrators' party, including the PAC that had part in \nthe interim constitution that was accepted on the 3rd of December \n1993, almost or just less than a month before this attack was still \nlaunched.\n\tWhy was this attack executed, given all these things?  The \ntime period and the fact that we already embarked on a road to \ndemocracy?  It was years after everybody had already accepted, \nseveral years after it was accepted and realised that the freedom \nstruggle was over and in my opinion, and I believe that this is the \ncommon belief under South Africans, this attack was launched in a \nperiod when the struggle was over, there was no reason for any \ngroup or fraction to prove a point, by launching such attacks.\n\tThis was completely out of and after the supposed accepted \ntime frame when such terrorist attacks was executed to prove a \npoint as part of the struggle, but the struggle was already over.\n\tThis point was proved, and I can't understand why this attack \nwas still sent through.  For this very reason, I am not prepared and I \ncannot find it in my heart, to forgive them at this point in time.  I \ntherefore oppose this application for amnesty.  I do not believe that \nany murderers or criminals should be granted amnesty.  The \nmurderers and criminals have been tried, convicted and sentenced by \na Supreme Court in this country.  It proves to the ordinary person \non the street and every other criminal, that it is just another one set \nfree, or another three will be set free on our streets to roam as many \nother criminals in my belief, are still free on the streets.\n\tThe fact that the command was given by your higher \nauthorities, still does not give any, and I repeat I want to stress that \nit does not give any person the right to go out and shoot young, \ninnocent people that sat in a Tavern that night, that had no \nconnection whatsoever with the Security Forces in this country.  I \nhad no political affiliation to anybody, I was merely visiting a very \ngood lady friend of mine that has been killed in this attack, Lindi \nAnne Fourie, and I cannot see in my heart, ever, that any person has \ngot that right to walk in and take another person's life in cold blood \nwhen you don't even know who you are shooting at.\n\tLives have been taken and lives have been maimed because of \nthese orders handed down.  There is in my opinion no reason \nwhatsoever, to be such cowards, as to attack a pub full of cheerful \nyoung students in the middle of the most cosmopolitan area, \nObservatory, in Cape Town, on the eve of new year, whilst they are \nenjoying their youth together with youths of all other races, colours \nand creeds and all this whilst we were on our way to the first \ndemocratic elections in this country.\n\tI request of the perpetrators and their leaders, and I would \nlike to echo what Mrs Fourie said, that was the higher command, the \nhigher parts in the PAC and I believe, I heard what you said Mr \nChairman, that it will be looked at further, and I do hope that it will \nbe looked at further, but I request of them all, to explain to us why \nthis was done, and if they have any logical reasoning for such a \nsenseless attack at that time.\n\tMr Chairman, I oppose this request for amnesty. \n\tIn conclusion, I just want to mention for the record, that I am \nnot going into any detail whatsoever, as to my emotional suffering, \nphysical pain, absolute distress and anger, fear I went through \nduring those couple of months in hospital and the following years up \nto now, the absolute indescribable sacrifices and pain that my \nparents, my brother and my sister went through, pain and anger and \nfear that my family and friends experienced.  The humiliation of \ntrying to adjust back into a very unforgiving society as an invalid, \ndependant on people for almost everything that you have to do, \nhaving to cope with the very unfriendly environment every day of \nyour life.\n\tNeedless to say I could write, mention of write another 200 \npages just on those few points, Mr Chairman, however, I have been \nable to cope in many respects and I will continue in my positive way \nas I believe I have been. \n\tIn conclusion to all of this, I am just interested in one thing, \nMr Chairman, I want to see justice served.

He was in the company of Lindi Anne Fourie, \nBernadette Langford and David Deglon.  He sat at the same table on \nthe platform.

            "The work was computer related.  We did a full \nrange of services from desk top publishing through to installations \nof computers.\n\tOn the night of the incident, the 30th of December 1993, \nmyself and my cousin, Grant January stopped at the Heidelberg \nTavern in Observatory.  Within minutes of entering the Tavern, we \nhad barely sat down, there were loud popping noises which I \nimmediately identified as gunfire.\n\tI wasn't at that point sure whether the gunfire was inside or \noutside the Tavern, but judged it safe to or the safest course being \nto take cover under the table at which I was sitting.\n\tEarly in the shooting, I was hit in the back of my left leg \nwhich caused extensive injuries to my leg and pelvis.  I will briefly \noutline the nature of those injuries.  The bullet resulted in a \nshattered thigh bone and I got a 40 cm steel pin which runs from my \nknee to my hip joint.  I have also since about a year after the \nincident, on the 8th of November 1994, I had a nerve graph to try \nand repair extensive nerve damage within my left leg, but this has \nnot had much effect.  With the result that my left leg is still pretty \nuseless today and I walk with a limp.\n\tI have been recommended by a family Doctor to walk at least \nwith a stick.  For the first year I used crutches exclusively, but since \n1995 I have been able to walk without the use of crutches and \nalthough on recommendation I should be using a stick, I find this \nimpractical for the type of work I do at the moment.\n\tWhile I was in hospital and on crutches and in the first few \nmonths after I was shot, the nature of my injuries was such that I \nwas unable to continue with my business.  It resulted in the loss of \nthat business.  My brother was without work and my parents were \nwithout the support I had provided them.  In fact the situation had \nbeen reversed, it was now my parents who supported me and my \nbrother was left to find employment elsewhere, which he eventually \ndid.\n\tNeedless to say, being a cripple today as it were, I have \nsuffered extensively in terms of pain, discomfort, I've had a \ncomplete change of lifestyle, the loss of my business, the loss of \nincome and the work I do today, in no way can be compared to what \nI used to do before I was so injured.\n\tIn this last four years, I have also lost many friends and \nalienated family members as a result of behaviour and personality \nchanges due to depression, frustration and bitterness.  Many days I \nwas unable to get myself out of bed in the morning, because I felt \nnot only had I lost the use of my leg, I had also lost my business, my \nincome, my whole future as it were.  Often I felt that there was no \nreason to go on, or to do anything.\n\tEven today I suffer from continuous discomfort and after a \nlong day of work, I often have to ask a family member for a massage \nto ease back pain and pain in my hip.  The loss of sensation which I \nhave suffered in my left leg, is extremely dangerous as well, as I \noften step in things or bang my leg or foot against obstructions \nwithout realising that I have done so.\n\tIf I am lucky this only results in a fall which is not too bad, \nand I have learnt to cope with it, but sometimes I have hurt myself \nmore than I realised.  \n\tRegarding my position on amnesty I would also like to say the \nfollowing.  It has been an exceptionally difficult four years since my \ndisability.  I have suffered from a great many things.  I have \nundergone various operations.\n\tI lost my business, etc.  I have continually prayed to God to \ngive me strength to face these hardships and the courage to forgive \nthe men who inflicted this disaster on my family.  This forgiveness \ndid not come easily and for many years I dreamt of vengeance as it \nwere, of somehow getting my own back, but I can now say that the \nLord God, my Saviour, has given me the strength to unconditionally \nforgive these men regardless of whether they are asking for \nforgiveness or not.  I unconditionally forgive them for what they \nhave done to me personally, however, I obviously cannot - it is not \nmy place to forgive them for what they have done to the other \npeople who have suffered as a result of their actions.  Or as it were \nfor what this country has had to go through as a result of the \nactions.\n\tI cannot say with any truth that I have forgiven the people \nwho sent them.  Neither can I say with any truth that I have forgiven \nthe system that left my family and me to suffer for the last four \nyears.  We did not receive so much as a phone call to provide us \nwith relief in the last four years, not from any person in Government \nor any Commission set up by the Government.\n\tThis is the bitterness that drives me to thinking of the Truth \nand Reconciliation Commission as no more than a mechanism of the \nsystem to forgive itself and whitewash the suffering that myself, my \nfamily and the people of this country, have endured.\n\tDespite having forgiven the men who shot me, I still wish to \nhear the truth.  Why were we victimised, what did they hope to \nachieve by what they did to us?  I can't honestly think that they \nbelieved that what they did to us, has achieved anything.\n\tI hope that these men will not receive amnesty unless they \ncome forward with the whole truth and expose all the (indistinct) \nbehind this event.  I don't know if the Truth Commission will follow \nup all the people responsible, or even if all of them have applied for \namnesty.\n\tAs a result of attending, further to the submissions that I have \nmade and which I have summarised, I also wish to say that as a \nresult of attending these hearings now and listen to the applications \nand read in fact some of the applications that has been made, I find \nit most disconcerting that the applications these men have made, are \nvery vague.\n\tIn fairness to them, I would say that regarding the position \nthey were in, they were probably not given enough time to make a \nfull application, but the impression certainly as in this hearing is that \nthe full disclosure has not been made.\n\tMore facts are continually being extracted in these hearings \nand added and amended to the applicants' statements but which for \nsome reason, was not part of the original statement, that these \napplicants have made.  For their sake, I hope that this is not \nconstrued as deliberate attempts to be vague, but for example Mr \nMadasi's admission that he was inside the Tavern, was a crucial \npiece of information which should have been in his original \nstatement.\n\tI hope that this does not negatively impact on Mr Madasi's \napplication.\n\tI do also feel that I know something of where these men come \nfrom emotionally and politically as I myself have experienced \noppression in the schools and in the townships in which I was raised. \n And yet for all that our family have experienced, I can say that my \nfamily has experienced a lot under Apartheid and under the racist \nregime of the National Party, yet, we never turned to the course \nthey took.\n\tIt has often been said by various people in Government, that \nthe actions of freedom fighters should be considered in the light that \nthey were fighting a just cause, a just and noble cause, being the \nfreedom and justice for all the people of this country.  However, in \nthe light of that cause shouldn't the actions they take to further that \ncause, reflect the nobility and the justice of the cause for which they \nare fighting?\n\tI don't think indiscriminate murder can properly be considered \nin the light of a just war.  Many freedom fighters, many soldiers for \nthe cause of liberation, have done sometimes many brave things and \nvery courageous things and all of this, in a very noble course and I \nthink that many of them, would not want to be considered as \nindiscriminate murderers.\n\tMy differences are not with these individuals though, but with \nthe mentality of an organisation which led to its soldiers and allowed \nthose soldiers to attack its own Government.  We all know that the \npeace negotiations were well on the way by the time this attack took \nplace.  In fact the National Party, the racist regime, had already \ntransferred power to the Transitional Executive Council and the \nelections was almost inevitable, but this organisation had the gall to \nallow these men to be tried and sentenced while its leaders embraced \nthe gravy train as it has been called.\n\tWhere are these leaders today?  They are hiding behind these \nmen who are being duped into losing their chance at amnesty while \nthe leaders continue on that gravy train.  I am opposed to amnesty, \nnot on the grounds of truth or the disclosure of these men, but that \namnesty cannot be given to us the survivors.\n\tMr Prior has attempted on various occasions to explain to me \nthe nature of these proceedings and amnesty, and he explained to me \nthat the word amnesty as derived from the Greek word amnesia, \nwhich means to forget.  Well, we cannot forget.\n\tA just war is understandable, but granting amnesty to people \nwho killed indiscriminately will be condoning the actions of every \nsingle individual worldwide, who has ever planted a bomb on an \nairplane, machine gunned a restaurant or killed innocent people in \nthe name of political idealism.\n\tI don't think that is the message South Africa wants to send \nout to the world that killing innocent people is justifiable, \npolitically.  If you are going to be fighting a just war, then you must \nconsider your actions in the light of the cause for which you are \nfighting.\n\tI would almost go so far as to say that the actions, not \nnecessarily by the three gentlemen I have in front of me, but the \nactions of their leaders by sending them on such an attack, I would \nalmost go so far as to say that the actions are treasonous in that \ntheir attempt was to derail the peace process and to derail the \nelections and would have resulted in great bloodshed for this \ncountry.\n\tSo their actions are treasonous to the people of this country \nand I don't believe that the attack on the Heidelberg has in any way, \nfurthered their cause.  In fact, I believe that it was a set back to \ntheir cause and in that light, their actions are treasonous to the \ncause for which they fought, or claim to have fought.\n\tThat is all I have to say at this point, Mr Chairman, thank \nyou.",

            "All right.  Please listen, and we will go through the \nstatement.  During October of 1992 my son, Brandon Clinton Palm \nwas convicted of attempted murder and robbery and sentenced to 12 \nyears imprisonment. \n\tBrandon had always maintained his innocence and after five \nyears of incarceration, still maintains that he was falsely implicated \nin these crimes by members of the Murder and Robbery Unit, Cape \nTown.\n\tBy all accounts the crimes lacked motive and seemed \nimprobable as the victim worked in the same building where my son \nwas employed as a security guard where the alleged attack took \nplace.\n\tSince 1992, my wife and I have pursued an arduous course of \nleave to appeal for retrial, review, Ministries of Law and Order, \nJustice, Correctional Services under the old and new Governments.  \nThe office of the Public Protector, Human Rights Commission, \noffice of Mandela and lastly the Truth and Reconciliation \nCommission all to no avail. \n\tAs a result of this situation, my daughter Rolanda Lucille \nPalm came to live in Cape Town in order to assist her brother and \nfamily in pursuing justice.  On the evening of the 30th of December \n1993, Rolanda and I were discussing the information she had \nobtained concerning the complainant in my son's case.\n\tWe were sitting in the Heidelberg Tavern in Observatory, \nenjoying a drink.  She had agreed to accompany me to the Tavern in \norder to get out of the house for a short while.  We left home at \nabout 10h35 pm and walked to the Heidelberg as it was five minutes \naway from my residence.\n\tOn arriving, I ushered my daughter into the restaurant area of \nthe Heidelberg, because I wanted to have a private discussion away \nfrom the noise of the music they were playing there.  On sitting her \ndown at the dining area, I walked to the bar, ordered a beer for \nmyself and a cooldrink for her.\n\tUpon sitting down at the table, I referred to my watch.  The \nreason I looked at my watch is that my daughter had just arrived \nfrom an afternoon shift at work and she was quite tired.  My \nintention was not to keep her out late.\n\tWe sat down, had a discussion which on estimate could have \nlasted for about 20 minutes.  While we were talking, I heard a \nspattered noise which was very strange.  I glanced up, over her \nshoulder to where the sound was coming from.  I noticed sparks, \nsmoke, glasses breaking.  I realised this was because someone was \nshooting into the Tavern.\n\tI did not see who was doing the shooting as my vision was \nblocked by a column in the Tavern.  On realising it was gunfire, I \nimmediately stretched over the table, pulled my daughter and said \nget down.  In that motion, I fell onto the bench and rolled onto the \nfloor.  My daughter dropped with her head to the table, and her back \nwas exposed.\n\tA hail of bullets was directed at us and a bottle and other \nthings on the table, fell onto the floor.  As I tried to look up from \nunder the table to see who was shooting, I noticed my daughter \nreaching the floor slowly.  In the same instance I noticed two other \ngirls to my right, fly out of their seats.\n\tUnfortunately all I could see was a cloud of smoke and the \nshadow withdrawing.  The next instant I saw this torch light object \nwhich knocked the side panel in the passage and rolled over to \nwhere we were.  I screamed it is a grenade, stay down, not realising \nshe was already hit.\n\tI still pressed her to the ground, under the table and counted \nto ten, waiting for this explosion.  When I realised nothing had \nhappened, I glanced over to where the object had fallen.  \nImmediately I noticed a trickle of blood on her shoulder as she was \nlying face down.  I immediately jumped from out of where I was \nlying to where she was, I turned her over and she just slumped in my \narms.\n\tI realised when looking at her, she was dead and I jumped out \nand ran to the door, to look for those responsible for the attack.  As \nI got to the door, I looked to my right and my left and immediately \nsaw a yellow van parked on the corner of Observatory and Lower \nMain Road, outside the chemist, facing Mowbray.\n\tMy immediate reaction was, oh, the Police are here already \nand I went back into the Tavern to double check on my daughter.  \nMy thoughts were that if the Police were there so soon, they had \nobviously caught the perpetrators.  I lifted my daughter up, felt for \nher pulse, but my hand just sunk into her neck.\n\tI laid her down on her back, tried to close her eyes, but they \nwould not close.  This is when the realisation got to me she was \ndead.  I immediately made my way home to tell my wife.  I was \nblinded by the shock and the tears.  I passed this van on the corner. \n When I passed, I noticed one figure there who had on a white \ngarment.\n\tWhen I got to the next corner to turn on my way home, I \nlooked back, still noticing the van standing on the corner.  Thinking \nit was very strange that for a person who had just come out of a \nplace that had been attacked, that nobody stopped me.  Well, I \nmanaged to get home all hysterical and my wife could not \nunderstand me as I was hysterical and incoherent.\n\tMy wife went to the Tavern to find out what was going on.  A \nfew days later Des Segal, the Investigating Officer came to my house \nto take a statement.  In the course of my making a statement to him, \nhe said that I must have been drunk as there was no such thing as a \nPolice van standing there.  I insisted he take it down in his statement \nand he did.\n\tHe said to me that if there was a Police van there, it must \nhave been a Police van which had been patrolling the area and had \nbeen radioed to the scene.  It must have been told not to go into the \nTavern as there was a bomb in there.\n\tI immediately became suspicious as I could not understand \nhow those Policemen could have been radioed and told about a bomb \nthat was in the Tavern.  I asked him that if they were radioed and \nknew about the attack, why they did not stop me after I had come \nout of the Tavern.  He could not answer my question and told my \nwife that I must have been drunk.\n\tAt the time of the court case, I was never used as a witness.  \nDes Segal told my wife that he could not use me as I would let the \nsuspects walk and they are APLA and they are the perpetrators and \nthey are used to killing people.\n\tHe went on to say that if they did not nail them for \nHeidelberg, he would not nail them for St James.   Am I going too \nquickly?",

            "I beg your pardon, can we correct that Mr Chairman.  \nJust delete the not.  I would like now to describe what kind of \nperson Rolanda was.\n\tShe was a kind, caring and warm hearted young woman.  She \nwas 22 years old and was a qualified primary school teacher.  She \nhad shown great tenacity and character in pursuing her studies and \nultimately qualifying.  She was determined and succeeded in making \nsomething out of her short life refusing to conform as so many \nyoung people did to the anti-social drug culture or aimless lifestyle \nso many have adopted.\n\tRolanda was a devout Christian and Roman Catholic.  She \nbelieved in the equality of man and was as a teacher dedicated to the \nupliftment of her fellow man, particularly children and the aged.\n\tShe did not support any political party.  She appalled \nviolence, particularly as a means to settle differences.  She believed \nin God and that all men were created equal, irrespective of race, \ncolour or creed.\n\tThe irony of her death is that she was not a white person who \naccording to APLA were the legitimate targets of the death squads.  \nNeither was Bernadette Langford and Michael January.  I cannot \nbegin to describe the rage I feel and have felt for the past four years \nat her senseless killing.\n\tRolanda had a tremendous zest for life.  She loved sport, \nswimming and athletics were her passion in which she excelled.\n\tI say to the PAC and APLA and to the applicants you killed \nthe wrong person.  Rolanda was also joined in the struggle against \nthe injustice of the Apartheid system, particularly in Education.\n\tYou simply ended her life as if she was a worthless piece of \nrubbish.  You say you did so to liberate AZANIA.  I say you did so \nfor your own selfish and criminal purposes.\n\tYou prevented Rolanda from helping rebuild our broken \nnation, which if you had simply waited another few months, in fact \ncame to pass when we had free elections.\n\tThere is a reference to Brigadier Nene, it is actually Brigadier \nPhitla.  The spelling in the submissions of the PAC is Phitla, but it \ncould also be spelt Fitla.  Your Commander, Brigadier Phitla stated \nthat it was difficult to control the forces on the ground due to lack \nof proper communication and proper political training.\n\tThese are simply empty excuses that in fact exposed APLA for \nwhat it was, an unguided missile out of the control of the PAC at \nloggerheads with each other and unable to accept the political \ndecisions of their political masters.\n\tThe Brigadier also stated that the cadres as in the case of the \napplicants, were simply carrying out orders of their Commanders.  \nWell, if that is so, why haven't the Commanders Letlapa Maphalela \nor Andile Mayo Sciceka applied for amnesty?  What are they afraid \nof?\n\tAPLA have stated that they were at war with the white \nsupremist settler regime and that in terms of that were their soldiers \nor cadres tasked with destroying the enemy targets, ie the white man \nwherever they found them, particularly in order to obtain firearms.\n\tWhite households and farmers were regarded as military \ntargets.  What APLA has not explained is how the Heidelberg \nTavern was selected as a military target.  If proper planning and \nsurveillance had been done, APLA would have discovered the \nfollowing.  (1) the Tavern catered for the multi-racial clientele, (2) \nthe predominant patrons were young students from the University of \nCape Town, (3) the Tavern did not cater exclusively for military \npersonnel, not could be described by any intelligent person as a \nmilitary target where arms could be obtained, (4) its resident \nmusician was one Josh Sithole, a black man who was loved and \nrespected throughout the country by multi-racial audiences \ncountrywide and who was entertaining the patrons at the time of the \nattack, (5) a better military target and that put in (indistinct), which \nfulfilled their criteria, was the Woodstock Police Station, a short \ndistance away.\n\tAPLA as well as the applicants cannot be truthful when they \nstate that by murdering patrons at the Heidelberg Tavern, this was a \nbona fide act associated with the political objective.  What these \namnesty applicants seek to do is to clothe criminal acts which have \nalready been adjudicated upon by the High Court, in the mantle of \npolitical type conduct.\n\tIt was amazing to hear from APLA military intelligence, \nBrigadier Phitla that he have never heard of the protocols of the \nGeneva Convention governing the waging of a war of liberation and \nthat he had only heard of such rules and regulations when he \nrecently joined the SANDF.\n\tIt would therefore seem that ignorance of the protection given \nto innocent civilians, unconnected to the offensive regime or its \nadministration in times of conflict, by the Geneva Convention is now \nraised as an excuse to justify the very inhumanity witnessed at the \nHeidelberg Tavern.\n\tI maintain that the perpetrators of the killings, when they \nentered the Tavern, could have as trained soldiers so we are told, \nassessed the situation and seen first hand that the people they were \ngoing to kill, in fact were not the targets they were ordered to kill \nand could have turned back, but they did not.\n\tThe systematic shooting of the patrons as they did, three \nfemales deceased, together with the attempt to explode the nail \nstudded rifle grenade was not to further any political objective.  \nWhat does APLA command mean when it says that it assumes \ncomplete responsibility for the Heidelberg Tavern attack?\n\tDoes APLA command realise that with responsibility comes \naccountability?  I repeat my question, if APLA is genuine about \ntaking responsibility, why have none of the Commanders applied for \namnesty?\n\tHowever, APLA tells the world that for what they did at the \nHeidelberg Tavern and to my daughter, they will never apologise.  \nThe killings at Heidelberg Tavern and the attempted justification \nthereof by the APLA command, must be viewed soberly against the \nbackground of the political reality as of 30th December 1993.\n\t(1) The peace process had progressed towards democracy and \nthe first ever democratic elections were only months away, in fact in \nApril 1994, (2) the PAC which must have informed its military wing, \nAPLA, had committed to the peace process and was a willing and \nvociferous participant, (3) the PAC had in November of 1992 \npledged a cessation of violent struggle and imposed a moratorium of \nviolence.  It was reported in the Rapport newspaper on the 2nd of \nJanuary 1994, (4) the Apartheid Government had handed control to \nthe politically negotiated TEC until the elections only a short time \naway.\n\tHistory indicates that a politically negotiated settlement had \nin fact won the day.  The liberation struggle had delivered the \ngoods.  The was was over and that majority ruled.   It seems from \nthe submissions made by APLA on the 7th of October 1997, before \nthe TRC, that APLA had on its own decided the war was not over \nand in order to keep its support from its followers, it had to be seen \nto be retaliating against white people because black people were still \nbeing killed.\n\tIf this was the rational behind the attacks, then in this context \nthe Heidelberg attack was nothing more than a reprisal or revenge \nattack.  If this is so, political objective cannot be argued.  What the \nact of terror did achieve, was the broad condemnation by all \npolitical groups as well as international rebuke.\n\tBoth Zimbabwe and Tanzania are reported to have severely \nrebuked APLA, reported in Argus newspaper, 12 January 1994.  The \nANC condemned the killing as being acts of (indistinct) aimed at \nderailing the peace process and preventing free and fair elections, \nreported in the Rapport, 2nd of January 1994.\n\tDespite the numerous TRC hearings, amnesty applications and \nPolice investigations involving hundreds of personnel, thousands of \nman hours and possibly millions of rands, we are still no nearer the \ncomplete truth not only in the Heidelberg Tavern matter, but in all \nothers where gross violations of human rights occurred.\n\tI firmly believe that a wider conspiracy exists which is yet to \nbe uncovered.  I shall not rest until it has been and only then \nperhaps, shall I be satisfied that justice has been seen to be done and \nonly then, if those faceless and gutless politicians, military and \nSecurity Force personnel are exposed and prosecuted to the full \nextent of the law.\n\tMy unease in this regard is as a result of the following \ncircumstances.  (1) although I witnessed the attack, saw a Police van \non the scene, I was bullied by Des Segal, the Investigator, to forget \nthat fact.   When I refused, he tried to discredit me by saying that I \nwas probably drunk at the time and if I did say what I had seen, at \nthe trial, it would upset the Prosecution.  As a result I was kept out \nof the witness box.  If Segal had simply explained why a van could \nhave been there, I would possibly have accepted it and called it a \nday. \n\t(2) What was the Police doing there in the first place, where \nwere the occupants and what were they doing?\n\t(3) The Police investigation had within a very short space of \ntime, three or four days, solved the case despite six persons arrested \nand charged, only three perpetrators stood trial.  The charges were \nwithdrawn against the rest.  If the evidence was strong enough to \narrest and charge them, why were they not prosecuted?  Was the \nconspiracy only limited to these six?  These persons were Theo \nMabusela, Michael Siyolo and Richard Dala.\n\t(4) The person who supplied the weapons and ammunition to \nthe perpetrators were known to the Police.  Were they arrested and \nlater released or are they still at large?\n\t(5) Letlapa Maphalela, the Director of Military Operations of \nAPLA is implicated in Heidelberg Tavern, yet is allowed to go free. \n He is not applying for amnesty for the Heidelberg Tavern, nor has \nhe been arrested.\n\t(6) Other implicated persons are Basie Mcombusi and \nTheofolus Sibeko.  Why are they still at large?  There whereabouts \nare known to the authorities?\n\t(7) Denzil Potgieter who defended the killers of my daughter, \nnow is a Commissioner of the very Committee called upon to grant \nthem amnesty.\n\t(8) Dumisa Ntsebeza, a Commissioner with the TRC, has been \nmentioned in connection with the Heidelberg Tavern attack in that it \nis alleged that his vehicle was used in some way or the other.\n\t(9) Des Segal died in a car crash early this year.  In the \nwreckage an R4 rifle, an RPG rocket launcher was found.  The press \nreport talked about a possible link with the notorious Vlakplaas.  I \nrealise some two years have elapsed between these two events, but \nsomehow I can only attack some sinister meaning to this.  The public \nhave heard no more about Segal's R4 rifle, strangely it is the same \ntype of weapon used in the Heidelberg Tavern incident.  My \nquestion is whether this weapon has been tested or checked to see \nwhether it was the same one used at the Heidelberg Tavern.  I \nappeal to the Amnesty Committee to urgently order an inquiry into \nthe Des Segal affair.\n\t(10) As at the 30th December 1993, the murders at Heidelberg \nTavern fell outside the time frame set for amnesty applications, yet \nit was decided to extend this cut off date.  My question is why?\n\tI have a perception that the real perpetrators of the most evil \nacts, are not going to be exposed and that the wrap will fall on the \nfew hirelings who did their bidding.  People who by their own \nadmission have committed gross violations of human rights and who \nare required simply to tell the truth, are assisted by high powered \nlegal representatives in order to do so.\n\tIn the majority of these cases, other than Heidelberg, the \nfunding of these lawyers is paid for by the very victims against who \nthey apply for amnesty from criminal prosecution or civil liability.\n\tI have lost two children to the system, my son to the \nApartheid system of justice and my daughter at the hands of killers \nthat the system seems to protect.\n\tIn an attempt to find out who politically was also guilty of the \nacts of murder at Heidelberg Tavern, I approached members of the \nPAC namely Ms De Lille, Barny Desai and Richard Zinani.  Ms De \nLille told me that she had personally spoken to the applicants in this \namnesty application and that they had steadfastly denied involvement \nin the killing.  I have noticed that the applications for amnesty of the \napplicants say very little about the actual attack.\n\tGqomfa suggests that the attack was launched from outside \nthe Tavern.  He does not suggest that anyone entered the premises \nand shot whilst inside.   Madasi and Mabala had given no details \nwhatsoever.  I am forced to wonder why not.\n\tIs this a tactic?  Have they not yet decided what to say and \nwho to implicate or will those details only be filled in after \nconsultation with the hierarchy of the PAC or APLA?\n\tI also wonder whose interest ought to safeguarded here.  I \nurge this Committee that common sense and justice prevail in your \nassessment of the evidence and refuse amnesty.  I do not wish to \ndwell on my personal circumstances, however, I have been advised \nthat such information is important to reveal to you.\n\tThe pain of losing my son was compounded a million times by \nthe death of my daughter.  I felt responsible and guilty for both of \nthem.  I have lived with that for the past four years.\n\tMy personality has changed.  I have not been able, despite \nextensive therapy and counselling at Valkenberg Hospital, to shed \nthe anger, rage, guilt, feelings of revenge and helpless desperation at \nthe system that allows murderers to escape punishment.\n\tSuffice to say my marriage has suffered irreparable harm.  My \nwife suffers from extreme anxiety and nervous tension.  We are both \non constant medication.  I am not being able to forgive the killer of \nmy daughter Rolanda, and cannot be a hypocrite and say so when my \nheart has feelings of murderous rage towards them and their \nmasters.\n\tFinally, I challenge the leader of the PAC, Bishop Magoba, \nnot to justify atrocities like Heidelberg Tavern with reference to \nsimilar atrocities perpetrated by the Apartheid regime, but to \nacknowledge it as a gross violation of the human rights of all those \nyoung people who were killed and maimed and to name all those \nwho were involved in the authorization, planning and execution of \nthe attack  so that the truth will be known.\n\tThis was dated at Cape Town on the 27th of October, that \nwas Monday, 1997.

It is my \nunderstanding that during the struggle the main aim and objective \nwas to free Mr Mandela and lead our people out of bondage to \nensure a brighter future for all.\n\tOn the 30th of December 1993, the struggle was supposedly \nover as Mr Mandela was free.  For my family and I, it brought \nnothing but sorrow and pain.  Bitterness and hatred eats away the \nsoul, but our soul was destroyed the day APLA brutally murdered \nmy daughter.\n\tI have nothing but contempt for these (indistinct) who now \nare enjoying the new South Africa, while others weep and mourn \ntheir loved ones.  These demons are now being integrated into our \nalready corrupt Police Force.  What was wrong with Mr Mandela to \nallow these monsters to take over?\n\tSurely they will kill their colleagues who are now forced to \nwork with them, these power hungry, evil (indistinct), sworn by \nSatan himself, seek only to overthrow the Government as they claim. \n They are the Government in waiting.\n\tI hope the Commission keeps this in mind when granting \namnesty to these wicket lost souls.  APLA's main goal in life is to \nseize power for themselves, they have shown the world that they \nhave no regrets for their crimes and evil deeds.\n\tThey will kill again, that I can assure you.  The word APLA \nspells fear in the people's hearts and the leaders embrace this \nknowledge, that is why they say and do as they deem fit.  As for \namnesty, whether I oppose it or not, they will definitely be freed to \ncontinue their devious work by repossession or whatever they can \nlay their filthy paws on, even if it does not belong to them.\n\tAPLA have taken from us one of the most precious gifts the \nLord can ever give us, my daughter was everything a mother, a \nfather and brothers and sisters could ever want.  And the void her \ndeath has left us all, an and will never be filled again.\n\tI will never in all the time left to me, forgive anyone that had \na hand in her death.  I ask God every day to understand and forgive \nme for feeling all this hatred and contempt that I have for her \nmurderers.  My daughter was the type of person that would have \nwanted me to forgive these killers, as she believed in our Creator.\n\tI would just like to thank the Commission for taking the time \nto read my letter and I will also like to ask the Commission if they \ncould read this letter to the amnesty applicants because I would like \nthem to know exactly how we feel.

            "Yes.  Mr Chairman, I am going to skip all the other \ndetail and just read from paragraph 3 onwards.  His personal details \nand employment history is clear.  Thank you Mr Chairman.\n\tRegarding the incident, paragraph 3 at page 73 of the bundle \nof submissions, you said as follows   I had been on duty at \nMachados restaurant on the night of the 30th of December 1993 \nwhen the incident in question took place.\n\tThe restaurant had been quite full that evening, being the \nfestive season and everyone was in a jolly mood.  After the \nrestaurant had closed, the owner Joe Cerqueira, his brother and \nanother colleague whose name I can't remember, had been clearing \nthe restaurant and set about preparing the restaurant for the next \nday's business.\n\tWhen we heard what we assumed was a car backfiring in the \nroad outside, the sound continued and we thought that it may also \nbe the sound of fireworks thrown by some partygoers outside.  I was \nthe first to walk out of the restaurant to investigate and was \nfollowed by my colleagues.\n\tI saw individuals coming out of the Heidelberg Tavern, which \nis located next to Machados restaurant.  They were making their way \nto a dark coloured car.  I saw what again I thought was flares or \nfireworks and then noticed these individuals were firing automatic \nmachine gun fire in all directions.\n\tOnce they spotted me and my colleagues, they fired in our \ndirection.  In the resulting confusion, we pushed our way back into \nthe restaurant and took cover as best we could.  I remember lying \nflat on the floor of the restaurant.\n\tOnce the firing had stopped, I ran out of the restaurant.  It \nwas at this stage I saw the deceased, Joe Cerqueira lying, dying in \nthe gutter, he had been shot in the chest.  The result was complete \nmayhem as people ran around in shock, shouting for help.  It was \nonly at this stage, when I knelt down next to the deceased that I \nrealised that I had been shot in the leg.\n\tMy thoughts at that stage were about Joe Cerqueira and I \nremember thinking Joe, you can't die now.  The exact details of what \nhappened after that are not clear to me.\n\t4.  The effect of the incident.  A month after the shooting, my \nlife had fallen to pieces.  I withdrew totally from the day to day \nactivities of life.  Interests that I once had such as mountain \nclimbing were now of no importance to me.\n\tI withdrew from all sporting activities that I had been \ninvolved in.  I began drinking alcohol heavily, suffered insomnia and \na lack of concentration of things going on around me.  The most \ntraumatic effect that this had on me, has been the loss of contact \nwith those closest to me, my family.\n\tI was referred to professional help to the psychology \ndepartment of Groote Schuur Hospital.  I also saw a psychiatrist at \nthe hospital, who diagnosed me as suffering from post traumatic \nstress and was placed on medication for one year.\n\tAfter the incident I applied for a job at the Crab Shack \nrestaurant in Milnerton.  During my first shift deliveries were being \nmade to the restaurant via the back entrance.  I was unaware of the \ndelivery and when I saw the black gentleman walking into the back \nentrance, I thought this could also be an attack on the restaurant.  I \nbroke in a sweat and had a panic attack.\n\tResulting in the fact that I broke down and was unable to \ncontinue working at the restaurant.  I never returned to this \nrestaurant, the realisation as how quickly one's life can be taken \nbecame a nightmare for me.  Joe's death had effected me adversely \nand as I feel I have become a total nervous wreck.\n\tI was once again referred to the out-patient department of \nGroote Schuur Hospital and also to the welfare department, who \nafter consulting with me, applied for disability family grant.  It was \nalso recommended that I attend Valkenberg Hospital for further \nobservation.\n\tBecause of the connectation attached to Valkenberg Hospital, \nI refused and stayed away.  I feel as if I have become a monster.  I \nfeel distanced from my family and unable to guide them as leader of \nthe household.  My life seems to be a constant see saw in that I feel \nup one day, and down the next.\n\tI feel as if my manhood has been taken away from me.  I \nseldom feel as if I would be able to be a normal person again.\n\tMy view regarding the amnesty application.   If this had been \nan accident, I could find it in my heart to forgive the applicants.  \nThis was purely a terrorist attack for which the applicants had \nwillingly trained and executed their orders.  And they too, like those \nof us who have suffered the trauma because of this incident, should \npay the price.\n\tI am sure they were reimbursed by their employers, something \nthat we have not been.  I therefore oppose the application for \namnesty for these individuals. \n\tHow I see the future.  The future seems bleak for me and my \nfamily as I have been unable to hold down a permanent job.  The \ninability to be the leader of my family, has been debilitating to say \nthe least and I really fear for the future of my children.\n\tReparation and compensation.  I feel that what has been taken \naway from me and my family, should be compensated for and I \nwould appreciate the Reparation Committee to look into this.  \nSigned at Cape Town, the 22nd of October 1997.\n\tDo you confirm that statement?",

And you kept \nstressing the point that I didn't mention anything about Frans and \none thing and another, I want to try and control myself.\n\tMy suggestion is we heard the shots, Joe was not in the front \nof the restaurant, I am talking about the front area of the restaurant, \nnot near the front, just the front area of the restaurant, he was not \nthere, he was not there, he was at the back.\n\tHe was at the far end of the restaurant, not in the front end of \nthe restaurant.  We heard the shots, I went out.  Right, when I went \nout, I saw guys coming out of the Tavern next door and as they \nwere coming out, getting into their cars, they were shooting, but to \nme it was like as if they were just ushered out, you know because \nthey were causing disturbance there and they were just told to leave, \nthat is the way I saw it.\n\tRight, they got into the car, the car was moving towards us, \nthe lights were still off.  Still shooting, still firing away, blindly, \nthen suddenly they fired at us.  I felt a push from the back, you \nknow, that is when I turned to run in.  And at no stage, at no stage, \nI will stress at no stage, was Joe Cerqueira outside there with us.  \nHe was not lying in that gutter, there at that yellow pole in front of \nus.\n\tMy suggestion is there is a possibility that when we turned to \nrun back inside, in the confusion there at the door, we running \ninside, no one verbally said Joe, duck, someone is shooting, no one \nsaid nothing, I can't remember seeing Joe or anything.  In that \nconfusion as we were running for our lives, Joe could have come \nthrough.  That is my opinion.  And to answer, you know, about the \ngun, as I said I don't, I have got no recollection.

Is this a man or not?\n\tRight, you are men, I am a man, I will talk straight to you and \nto the Chairman.  How do you know that you fatally wounded Mr \nJose Cerqueira, are you a seasoned or regular killer?\n\tYou pleaded not guilty at the trial, yet you say here that you \nintended killing and wounding as many people as possible and now \nsay you want amnesty.  How do I understand you?\n\tMr Chairman, I do find it very difficult to accept that the \nstatements given by these people are genuine, genuinely from them \nand perhaps not some concocted story to save their necks.  I am \nbeing blunt Sir, and I apologise if I do that, and I offend anybody, \nbut I am also not apologising.\n\tAccepting that I was not at the scene of the crime, I still \nbelieve I may ask why must I believe you when you say you did not \nenter the Tavern, when you say anything for that matter because \nbearing in mind what you have admitted to, that is the killing of \ninnocent people.\n\tI cannot believe anything you say because I cannot trust \nmurderers.  Why must I believe your statement about why you think \nyou should be absolved of this crime, the murder of my daughter and \nothers?\n\tThe post mortem should reveal quite accurately how close the \nkillers were to the victims when they were shot.  I refer to page 12 \nin the court proceedings, three young women were shot that evening \nin the Heidelberg Tavern.  It is on page 44 of the bundle.  \nBernadette Langford's heart was torn apart by the impact of the \nbullet, Lindi Anne Fourie was shot in the right hand side of the \nneck.  The bullet dragged all of the main blood veins off, and \ncrushed her neck bones.  Rolanda Palm was also shot in the heart.\n\tIf we were firing wildly, how coincidental is it Mr Chairman, \nthat three of the victims were shot in positions which would \ncertainly have meant virtually instant death?  I also was trained in \nthe use of firearms.  It is a frightening reality that lives with me \nevery day of my wife, I regret having been trained to aim at another \nhuman being and shoot.  I hope to God I never will have to do it.  \nThat is sincere and from my heart.\n\tThe apparent attitude of the applicants and particularly the \nso-called Commander of these men, tells me that their bona fides \ncould be suspect and essentially destroys their possible chances of \nbeing given amnesty.\n\tExcusme me Mr Chairman, I highlighted what I wanted to \nrefer to from the notes.",

Why do you get impatient and \nbear your teeth, you are asking and if you want to receive, surely \nyou need to ask in a reasonably humble and if not civilised manner \nand tone of voice.\n\tI would like to caution the applicants that perhaps they are \nbetter off in jail, than out on the street and I will just give you one \nreason.  I arrived home two days ago only to read in a newspaper \nfive armed robberies in 48 hours in the little dorp where I live.  \nYou've got competition and I am not being flippant here.\n\tBeware of your attitude Mr Mabala, you are asking for \nsomething, something bigger than you care to think about whilst you \nwere busy with your dirty work.  So it is not in your best interest to \nappear cheeky or impatient, even when your own Defence Counsel \nasks you questions, questions that you are required to answer before \nyour request can even be considered.\n\tNow, I will say something which you might find strange, but I \nam still a person, okay, despite my anger and my hurt.  Have you \nseen an elderly person crying, look at me today, just look at this.  \nTo the three and all of you related to this matter, I would not like to \nbe in your shoes.  I also feel very, very sorry for your parents and \nothers who are interested in you because they've got to bear it with \nyou and with us.

He addressed it to \nthe Chairman, it is from a Mr A.W. Hall.\n\tHe said  \n\t\t\"re the Heidelberg Tavern murder.  I have known the \nFourie family for many years and can remember Lindi \nAnne virtually from birth.  I carried her on my \nshoulders when she was a child and I remember her as a \nyoung girl who was mad about horses and loved \nanimals.\n\t\tI remember her as a shy and conscientious schoolgirl \nand I remember her showing off the magnificent matric \ndance dress that she had made herself.  Lindi Anne had \na strong character and an enquiring mind and was not in \nthe least bit surprised when I learnt that she had chosen \ncivil engineering as a career.\n\t\tIn fact being a civil engineer myself, I was proud of her. \n The one thing that never failed to impress me about \nLindi Anne was her pleasant and gentle nature.  She \ngave the impression that she didn't have an enemy in the \nworld.\n\t\tLindi Anne was not class or race conscious and \naccepted people as they were.   She always looked for \nthe good in people.  She had grown into a charming and \ntalented young lady who would, I am sure, have become \na valuable citizen and would have contributed positively \nto the future of this country had she not been murdered \nin her prime a few short months before graduating as a \ncivil engineer.\n\t\tI cannot express the anger I felt when I learnt of the \nsenseless murder at the Heidelberg Tavern, quite apart \nfrom the obvious anguish and irreplaceable loss suffered \nby her family and friends, our nation has been deprived \nof a really good above-average person, that had so \nmuch to offer society, murdered by a bunch of morally \nbankrupt nobodies, who have nothing to offer anyone.  I \nwill be extremely disappointed if those responsible for \nLindi Anne's death, are granted amnesty.\n\t\tAt the time of the attack, the political climate in south \nAfrica was already changing dramatically and I cannot \nsee that the perpetrators of the attack, can justify their \nactions on political grounds in any way whatsoever.\n\t\tMy feelings are not biased on racism.  Civilisation is \nnot man's natural state, it is an ideal that requires \nconstant and diligent effort.  We all harbour violent \nthoughts from time to time, but the difference between \na civilised person and a barbarian, like the Worcester \nbombers and the Heidelberg murderers, is that the latter \nhave no moral integrity to guide their actions.\n\t\tSuch people are a menace to any community and should \nbe removed from society permanently\".\n\tMr Chairman, I will close with the statement that I have, one \nparagraph Sir.  \n\tYou see Mr Chairman, for too long now, I want the people \nhere to hear this, a few people in this country of ours, have had any \nrespect for each other, the people, the courts, not anything that \nresembles a normal society.  Do wish to see this type of thinking \ncontinue?\n\tNobody in their right mind would wish it to continue, \ntherefore I have empathy for you, the Police, the Justice system and \nall others who are trying to bring about a change of attitude and \nhopefully a change in behaviour of all people, so as to ensure a \nreturn to a normal and safe society.\n\tMay you be granted all the courage and strength necessary to \ncarry out the task that you face.

He shouted - I can't remember who shot \nhim, it was very dark and I had already passed that point.  \n\tI was inside the premises to perform security and \ndefence functions there and I went to the shop to see if \nCAPE TOWN HEARING\tAMNESTY/",

The askari got into the vehicle by himself, into \nBrits' vehicle, he was not forced to get into the vehicle.  \n\tCol De Kock and I followed the Land Cruiser.  I asked \nDe Kock where we were going and he said we were going to \nPenge Mine to find out what the askari had to say.

            "we took a turn-off to the left and then it becomes a gravel \nroad. Here I want to make a correction.  Where it says the \naskari was tied up, that's wrong.  I will point that out \nnow.\tWhen we stopped on the dirt road and I got out of the \ncar and I went to the vehicle I then saw that the askari was \ntied up. I then inferred that they had tied him up whilst we \nwere driving.  I mean his hands were cuffed or something.\n\tAt that stage I wasn't quite certain of the purpose of \nthis operation, what was to happen to him, but my conclusion \nwas that the askari had been detained at the police station \nin De Deur and I believed that he would probably be killed \nbecause he was an ANC or PAC freedom fighter who had been \ncaught by the security police.  He then became an askari and \nthat he had gone back to the ANC and given information to\nthem. I then suspected that he probably would be killed, \nbecause otherwise we would have gone back to Vlakplaas with \nhim, and De Kock would then have spoken to him there.  \n\tI can't remember exactly why we stopped at Boschkop.  \nAs far as I can remember now, I think De Kock wanted to make \nsure that he was tied up.  I say here, and he also \nhandcuffed him.  I don't think he physically cuffed him, I \nthink he just checked to see that the cuffs were secure.  \n\tWe then drove off to Penge Mine, the mine situated on \nthe other side of Burgersfort, in the Eastern Transvaal and \nit was the first time that I ever went there.  We arrived at \nthe mine. It was - there was a small village community and \nthen outside the place there were several mines and this \nPenge Mine was one of these mines.  We arrived there that \nnight at the mine and then met Warrant Officer Snor \nVermeulen and Warrant Officer Lionel Snyman.

Approximately \nseven o'clock that evening, this vehicle had not arrived.  \nThe command was given by Willie Nortje that we must retreat \nand we went to Schoemaas, that was the police base close-by \nwhere we stayed and we went there to rest.  We started \ndrinking at the canteen and we used a lot of alcohol.

There were quite many of us, \nof Koevoet members from C10, from Vlakplaas as well as task \nforce members and also the local security branch members.  \nLater that evening we were told by Lucas Khimelo that him \nand the Koevoet members drove into the smugglers.  When they \ndrove into them the smugglers told them to go into a double \ntrack road because they didn't want to be in the main dirt \nroad there, because it was carrying heavy traffic.  Khimelo \nfollowed them and told us that the smugglers had weapons in \ntheir car and that they were afraid that they would be \nrobbed by these people.  They then decided to eliminate \nthese people by shooting them.  Because the police action \nduring that stage was sensitive and because C1 Vlakplaas \nused ex-Koevoet members, this evoked a lot of criticism from \nthe National Party and it was a problem.  After the \nsmugglers have been shot,  Khimelo returned and told us what \nhad happened.  First Cronje and Klopper and then us.

According to the Press reports, Mr \nCronje alleged that I publicly claimed that a \ncertain MacKenzie was an ANC member and that he \nhad blown up his own vehicle.  Mr Cronje then \nstated that there was no doubt in his mind that I \nknew what the true situation was.  Mr Cronje did \nnot indicate any source for this allegation.      \nThe facts are that the Botswana  Government \ncomplained to the South African Government.  The \nDepartment of Foreign Affairs, as is the normal \npractice, sent the Botswana Government's comment \nto the South African Security Forces.  The South \nAfrican Police responded that they had \nincontrovertible evidence that MacKenzie was being \nused by the ANC to transport weapons into South \nAfrica from Botswana.

I consider Mr Cronje's unsubstantiated \nallegations as a disgraceful attempt to draw \nattention away from his irresponsible activities. \n I will be grateful if the Committee could ask Mr \nCronje on what basis of fact he made these \nallegations.  Due to lack of time I have no other \nmeans, but to convey the statement telephonically \nto the Committee.\"",

There were many cars and it appeared as if there were many people insidethe church. Mlambisa drove into the parking area at the church and parked approximately10 metres from the entrance to the church. Mlambisa reversed the car so thatthe back was facing the entrance. Nonxuba and Makoma got out, each one armedwith a rifle and a grenade. They then entered the church. I heard a grenadeand gunshots and then saw a red car stopping in front of us, apparently to blockus. I got out of the car and threw a petrol bomb at the car and Mlambisa gotout and shot at the car, causing the car to speed away. Then Nonxuba and Makomacame out of the church, jumped into the car and we immediately sped away. Idid not do what I was supposed to do, that is to throw the petrol bombs insidethe church. I do not know what happened inside the church, but I am fully awarethat with the arms and ammunition carried by Makoma and Nonxuba, that peoplewould be killed or injured. When we were in the car and making our getaway,Makoma said that someone had shot at him inside the church and that he was bleeding,but neither Makoma, nor Nonxuba said what happened inside the church. Nonxubadid, however, ask why I did not throw the petrol bomb and then I explained tohim why I did not do so. We then drove to a place under the direction of Nonxuba.I later learned that this place is called Ottery. Mlambisa and I left Nonxubaand Makoma there at a house in Ottery with the weapons.

I submit that if one looks at the evidence before this Committee today, which to a very very large extent has been corroborated in substantial and material respects by the Judgment of Judge Nicholson.\n\tThe picture emerges that just prior to the 1994 elections the area of Bottlebrush became ungovernable due to the rise in prominence and in numbers and in strength of a gang known as \"The Mafia\" gang.  \n\tThe area which was an exclusive ANC area and had an ANC branch formed in it, the community looked to the ANC to provide the governance that was lacking from the government of the day.\n\tVarious efforts were attempted, including resorting to the assistance of the police and no help ...[indistinct] the way of the community.  The community tried its own endeavours, firstly by talking to the parents of the criminals concerned, in some instances assaulting them and in some instances banishing them but the problem didn't disappear.  The entire situation became unbearable and when the two young girls were raped, the community almost ...[indistinct] passed a sentence against these people.  \n\tLooking at it in retrospect, as Judge Nicholson pointed out that the death penalty has in fact been declared unconstitutional, but one must look at the prevailing circumstances at that time.  The community had no other option, they tried every other available means and it was the responsibility of the ANC to provide leadership and get rid of the criminal element.  \tIn that instance the three applicants were acting in furtherance of a political purpose, that is to provide governance which was lacking by the government of the day.  And in those instances I submit with respect, that the applicants have made out a case for amnesty and their actions were political and were necessary, given the circumstances that prevailed and the time and era in which it occurred.\n\tI'm therefore asking with respect, that the three applicants be given amnesty.",

The evidence is clear that the conduct of the applicants indicate an act associated with a political objective.  \tThere doesn't seem to have been any evidence regarding any personal gain and it would seem from the Judgment of His Lordship, Mr Justice Nicholson, that when they sought out the members of \"The Mafia\" responsible for these acts of terror, in fact they had the community in large numbers with them.\n\tMr Chairman, I don't have anything further to add and then leave the ultimate decision in the hands of the Committee.",

We have had put before us Indictment, Summary of Substantial Facts and Judgment relating to that case and I don't consider it necessary to set out any of the details.  We have also of course got the applications of the three applicants.\n\tIt is clear from the Judgment and from the evidence that was led before us today, that the killings took place in an area known as Bottlebrush, which was an ANC area and where the ANC committees sought to provide some form of government for the local community.\n\tThere is evidence that a gang known as \"The Mafia\" was causing havoc in the area, committing crimes of violence such as robbery, rape and that despite requests the police appeared to be unable to do anything to prevent the recurrence of these offences.\n\tThe community thereafter looked at the ANC and the representatives of the ANC for assistance.  All three applicants were either members or office bearers of the ANC at the time.  \n\tIt is clear from the Judgment and the evidence that they took what steps they could to try to stop the gang behaving as they did but were unable to do so and finally on the day in question were driven to desperation by the kidnapping and multiple gang-rape of some young girls the night before.\n\tIt is not necessary in my view to set out any detailed reasoning, that I refer to the Judgment which deals concisely with all that happened and to the argument advanced before us today by Mr Samuel, who also sets out sucintly the basis on which the application is brought before us and the reason why in his submission it should be granted.\n\tWe are satisfied that the three applicants acting on behalf of the ANC which was seeking to provide governance and assistance to the community, acted to prevent further crime, acted to support the community view that they could look to the ANC for assistance.  And this is in our view certainly an act committed with a political objective. \n\tThe conditions existing at that time were such that people could feel they were driven to violence.  It is of course no longer an excuse for anyone to continue to take the law into their own hands in such a way but in the circumstances that existed then, we feel it is not an act of such a nature that the applicants should be deprived of amnesty because of the brutality of the  act.  \n\tWe accordingly GRANT THE APPLICATION FOR AMNESTY OF ALL THREE APPLICANTS in respect of the killing of the persons set out in the indictment.  \n\tNone of the victims have been present here today but we have been given a list which we'll submit to the \nR & R Committee for their consideration.

They did so in the course of their duties as members of Umkhonto weSizwe, and the purpose of the visit was to enable firearms to be obtained which could then be used on behalf of Umkhonto weSizwe in the Pietermaritzburg district.\n\tThe firearms were obtained from the Transkei from ANC sources, and that morning they left Port Shepstone. Shortly after they had commenced their journey they noticed a police vehicle following them.  It later caused them to stop.  \n\tPolicemen got out and first asked for the licence of the vehicle and then indicated, I think it is quite clear, an intention to search the vehicle.  The weapons were inside the vehicle, they were not in the boot of the car which was found to be empty.  When the police approached the vehicle itself, we are told that Sergeant Groenewald drew his pistol whereupon one of the applicants companions drew his gun and opened fire on Sergeant Groenewald.\n\tThey drove away and were pursued by the police.  They came upon other police vehicles and roadblocks and there was firing between them and the policeman and ultimately their car came to a halt.  They fled into the bush, where the applicant was arrested.  He was subsequently charged and convicted of attempted murder and various contraventions of the Arms and Ammunition Act.\n\tWe are satisfied that the applicant was acting on behalf of Umkhonto weSizwe, as part of what was then contemplated was the struggle for the liberation of the country and that there was no personal motive involved, nor were the firearms to be used for anything other than the objects of Umkhonto weSizwe.\n\tWe are satisfied that he has complied with the requirements of the Amnesty Act, and that the acts for which he seeks amnesty were acts committed with a political objective in terms of the Act.\n\tThe information before us is to the effect that he was in possession of a Stechkin pistol which is a form of automatic pistol, and a great deal of ammunition as well as the handgrenades but on appeal his conviction for possession of the two AK47 rifles was set aside and there is no application before us, and this has been confirmed by his counsel, in respect of the AK47s.\n\tWe accordingly GRANT THE APPLICANT AMNESTY IN RESPECT OF THE ACT OR ACTS OF ATTEMPTED MURDER COMMITTED ON THE 1ST OF JULY 1991 on the road between Hibberdene and Port Shepstone and in respect of THE CONTRAVENTIONS OF THE ARMS AND AMMUNITION ACT, relating to the possession of a 9mm Stechkin pistol and 466 rounds of 9mm ammunition and 537 rounds of AK47 machine rifle ammunition and three handgrenades at the same time and place.\n\tWe are informed that it has not been possible to make contact with SERGEANT GROENEWALD who was severely wounded in the incident.  He has retired from the police force and has lost contact with those who knew him in the past.  We are nevertheless satisfied that HE IS A VICTIM and we direct that his name be referred to the R & R Committee with a request that they do what they can to enquire as to his whereabouts and to loss or damage he may have suffered.\n\tThat concludes our decision in this matter.",

The house is nearer to the police station, the eSikhawini Police Station.\n\tI came back.  I was with Enoch Nzuza.  He is one of the organisers for Numsa.

We then took a decision that our leaders should be guarded all the time.  \n\tI think it was round about half past nine when I got into the house and went to sleep.  I went to sleep and they remained behind watching television.  I think it was round about 10 when I was woken up by gunshots, shots that were being fired through my window and all over the place, the dining-room, the kitchen and everywhere.  \n\tI got a fright, I woke up and I had a licensed 9mm pistol.  I tried to make out as from which direction the gunshots were being fired in relation to the room in which I was sleeping.  Msize who was guarding me at the time rushed to my room to make sure that I was safe.  He told me to take cover.  Even though I could be in the position to protect myself at the time it was his duty and it was my responsibility to listen to him because he was taking care of my safety.\n\tI listened to him and the gunshots continued incessantly.  They had already thrown carnages of handgrenades into the house at the time and we all tried to rush outside.  I then told Msize that I would like to help him because he is the only one who was trained and therefore in the position to can protect all of us.  \tWe then agreed.\n\tWe tried to retaliate.  The handgrenades were thrown and we rushed to the bathroom, opened water to try and get some - I'm sorry, it was not a handgrenade it was teargas, we rushed to the bathroom.  We were used to the handgrenades because we also suffered the same fate at the hands of teargas.  We were used to teargas experiences at the hands of the police.  We rushed to the bathroom.  \n\tAll members of our union and activists knew that in cases of teargas attacks we had to get wet cloths.  On entering the bathroom we thought the gunshots would stop but they did not.  I ran out of ammunition and Msize and myself agreed that he should defend all of us and get us out of the house.\n\tHe got the rest of the people out of the house, Enoch Nzuza and myself remained behind and Enoch Nzuza had just been attacked the very same morning.  Enoch Nzuza had survived an attack that very same morning.  He would then bring some alcoholic beverage with him ...[intervention]",

            "I'm sorry.  He had a hot stuff or hot alcohol which he was consuming to try and cope.  It therefore became very difficult for him to withstand the teargas attack and we had to carry him if we really wanted to protect him and take him to safety, myself and Msize.\n\tMsize said I should leave the house and I resisted.  I said he should be the one who gets out of the house because he still had ammunition.  Msize then got out of the house and myself and Enoch remained behind. \n\tAfter Msize had left the house the gunfire stopped.  I rushed to the kitchen door which was open, left open when Msize ran out of the house.  And I can say that is about eight metres distance between my house and that of my immediate neighbour.  There were four people in a lying position facing towards the open door at the house.\n\tThe people who had left the house, I already know that they were three and I started wondering why there were four people lying there when only three people had left the house.  I concluded that this could not be the three people who had rushed out of the house.  \n\tI called out and the response that I got was a gunfire.  The person who fired the shot must have thought that I was shouting or calling out from the bathroom window towards which he then fired.  I then realised that these cannot be the people that I know.\n\tI then called out to Rich, my brother's son.  They then realised that the voice was coming from the direction of the door.  They fired these shots towards the door and they shot just above my head and I was then convinced that this cannot be the people that I know.  They were wearing black clothes and I think they were trying to camouflage so that they could not be identified.\n\tAfter some time a white van came and drove past a street just behind their backs, on the other side.  That is when I realised that these are the enemies because they all had rifles.  I then realised that these are the people who are attacking my house.  They also had balaclavas covering their faces.  They rushed to the van and I concluded that they were rushing to the van to get some more ammunition because they had already fired for more than 45 minutes.\n\tI then stayed on at the door, not leaving because I wanted to see what they would do ultimately.  They then came towards a window at the kitchen, all four of them and I could no longer see them from where I was standing.  \n\tThey slowly and gradually approached towards the window.  When they got there they said I should give them the gun that I was using to shoot them.  I did not respond.  They were appealing, saying I should give them my gun and they would let me go.  They thought I was shooting them with an AK and they wanted this AK.  They said if I did not give them this AK they would come in and threw another teargas canister, handgrenades, shoot me and kill me.\n\tI heard something being thrown inside again and I thought they had thrown yet another teargas canister into the house.  When they said they will throw teargas canisters and handgrenades in the house I immediately remembered that there was a handgrenade in the house that I had seen Msize carrying one day.\n\tI crawled to the place where this hand grenade was kept and I kept praying that it should be intact because if it was not connected or disconnected to the detonator I would not have been in the position to use it.  I found this handgrenade intact and I brought it back, crawled back to the kitchen.  \n\tThe door to the kitchen was clear.  No lights were on in the house, it was just dark and I realised that they were now desperately trying to get hold of my gun.  At that time I told them that I was badly injured as a result of the shots and I could not move.  I think they must have thought that it was now going to be easy for them to get me.\n\tThey came in rushing and pushing through the door.  I gave them the handgrenade.  I rolled it and removed the pin and gave it to them and it exploded.  I heard them screaming like small children, fleeing.  When I checked the situation at the door it transpired that the shrapnels were all over the place and I was not in the position to escape myself because of the lot of dust resulting from the explosion.\n\tAfter the dust had subsided I then got out of the house.  When I got out of the house I saw something that was lying next to the door.  I ran to my neighbours where I telephoned the police.  When I phoned the police I did not give them my real identity but then they apparently picked up my voice and wanted to know if I am Bheki Ntuli and I got a fright.",

            "We have listened to the application brought on behalf of Mr Ntuli, we've had reference to the bundle of papers, Exhibit A and to his evidence.  It appears that his application for amnesty arises from an attack on his home on the night of the 26th of August 1992 by a group of armed men.\n\tThere appears to be no doubt that at the time there was constant conflict between different political factions or parties in that area.  Mr Ntuli has told us that he was a member of Cosatu and was seen by members of the IFP as being an ANC supporter.\n\tHe has fairly told us that not only were attacks launched on his house but that he knows of attacks launched on the house of Mrs Ntjale, a Councillor who lived in the same area as him.\n\tWe are satisfied that the attack that took place that night was part of the ongoing conflict between political parties striving for dominance in the area. \n\tMr Ntuli related how during the course of the attack his bodyguard left the house to see what he could do from outside, his two nephews left the house and he was left in the house with Mr Enoch Mzuzu who was suffering badly from the effects of a teargas grenade that had been thrown at them.  He became aware of the fact that there were four other people outside the house who were going to continue the attack on the house.  \n\tIn fearing that they might gain entry and thereafter kill himself and Mr Mzuzu, he made use of a handgrenade that he knew to be in the house, and having enticed the four people to come towards the door of the house he threw the handgrenade or rolled the handgrenade towards them and thereby injured them and caused them to depart.\n\tHe is asking for amnesty in respect of the attempted murder of these four persons and the illicit possession of a handgrenade.   It appears to us that he has complied with all the requirements of the Act, that this was part of the political struggle and can properly be said to be an act with a political objective.\n\tIn those circumstances we GRANT THE APPLICATION IN RESPECT OF THE ILLEGAL POSSESSION OF A HANDGRENADE AND THE ATTEMPTED MURDER OF FOUR PERSONS ON THE 26TH OF AUGUST 1992.",

            "The applicant in this matter was a member of the ANC at all relevant times and was appointed as a bodyguard to the Cosatu Northern Natal Chairperson, Mr Vincent Shandu in 1991.  The incident in respect of which he claims amnesty took place on the 2nd of September 1992.\n\tHe gave evidence that Mr Shandu's brother had been killed two years earlier and that threats had been made against Mr Shandu, and it was for this reason that the ANC had appointed a bodyguard to reside in his house and had armed him with a machine pistol.\n\tOn the night in question there was a raid on Mr Shandu's house by members of the South African Police Force.  It was put to the applicant that Mr Shandu had a close relationship with members of the Security Police, that he saw them frequently to discuss matters like holding marches and matters of the nature but it is quite clear that he was given no notice of this raid.  The raid was as a result of an informer having said that there were firearms in Mr Shandu's house and the police obtained very properly, a search warrant from the relevant Magistrate and came to the house looking for these firearms.\n\tAlthough it is not of any direct relevance to the application, it is quite clear that no firearms were found in the house and that the information given by the informer had been incorrect. \n\tThe applicant in his application avers that he was woken up by the sound of shots being fired and that he fired shots through he window in his capacity as a bodyguard, in an endeavour to drive the attackers away.\n\tThe evidence led at the trial and contained in the affidavits which have been filed was to the effect that the police when they arrived at the house, surrounded the house and then knocked on the door loudly stating in English that they were the police and that they should open up.\n\tThere appears to be a dispute between the two versions but it may well be more a mistake than a dispute.  It appears to us that it is improbable that the police would have gone to the house legitimately to search it and just open fire for no reason whatsoever.\n\tIt appears equally improbable that the applicant had he known that it was the police who were knocking on the door of the house, would have opened fire on them.  He was after all the bodyguard of a responsible person who was well-known in the vicinity and who, as far as we know, had committed no wrongdoing.  There were no guns there to hide.  The only gun in the place was the gun he had been issued with to safeguard the life of Mr Shandu.\n\tHaving regard to the evidence as set out in the affidavits and with reference to the Judgment given, it appears to us extremely probable that the applicant was woken by noise and that when he awoke he was told or gained the impression that there were people outside, which was quite correct, that there were people who were trying to get into the house, which was quite correct, and he leapt to the assumption that these were attackers who had come to attack Mr Shandu.  This of course was incorrect but in the light of that he opened fire and fired two shots through the window, one of which very unluckily struck one of the policemen who was standing outside the house.\n\tIt wasn't suggested that he had aimed deliberately at him, and in view of the fact that it was 4 o'clock in the morning and that the only light that may have been there was from street lamps some distance away, it seems improbable that he could have seen a target.  The most he may have seen was shadows on the curtains.\n\tBe that as it may, it appears to us that when he acted as he did he was not intending to attack the police force, he was acting in the defence of Mr Shandu and that this amounted to an act with a political objective in terms the Amnesty Act.\n\tIt is not necessary to refer to all the documentation that was put up before us.  It appears that the matter was fully investigated and it is quite clear from the evidence led at the previous hearing, that there were numerous shots fired at the house, but it seems to us probable that these shots were fired after the Sergeant had been injured and were in retaliation for what was seen as an unprovoked attack on the Sergeant.   As I've said earlier there appears to have been misunderstandings and mistakes on both sides.  \tHowever we are satisfied that the applicant has made out a case for amnesty in respect of the attempted murder of the police who were outside the house.  He has applied for amnesty in respect of two counts of attempted murder.  It would appear that they were in respect of the two policemen, one of which is standing on each side of the door and these are charges which are presently pending against him.  He has also claimed amnesty in respect of the illegal possession of a firearm and of ammunition.  As I understand it, and Mr Wills can correct this if I am wrong, the firearm is the Stechkin machine pistol and the ammunition was the ammunition found for this pistol, 19 rounds.\n\tAccordingly the applicant is GRANTED AMNESTY IN RESPECT OF THE ATTEMPTED MURDER OF TWO POLICEMEN OUTSIDE HOUSE NUMBER 1658, SANDUMBILE ON THE 2ND OF SEPTEMBER 1991",

            "Then we would like to call the matter of Phila Martin Dolo for the purposes of releasing a decision in respect of that.  This is the matter of Phila Martin Dolo, reference number AM3485/1996 for the purposes of giving the panel's decision.  And by way of introduction again, in this matter we have been able, as a result of the circumstances which apply to the session, to be able, unlike in the normal course, to formulate a decision which we will present.\n\tThis is an application for amnesty pursuant to Section 18 of the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation, Act 34 of 1995.  \n\tThe applicant, Phila Martin Dolo, was at all material times a cadre of the Azanian People's Liberation Army, APLA, the military wing of the Pan African Congress, PAC, having received training as such under its auspices outside of the Republic.  He was tried and convicted on 5 December 1994 in the Witwatersrand Local Division of the then Supreme Court of the following\n1.\tMurder.\n2.\tAttempted murder.\n3.\tUnlawful possession of machine guns.\n4.\tUnlawful possession of ammunition intended to be fired from a machine gun or machine rifle or any similar armament.\n5.\tUnlawful possession of any explosive or incendiary device or any part thereof.\n6.\tUnlawful possession of a grenade.\n7.\tAttempted murder.\nHe was sentenced on 9 December 1994 as follows.  On the first charge, life imprisonment.  On the second charge, ten (10) years' imprisonment.  On charges three and four taken together for the purpose of sentence, twelve (12) years' imprisonment.  Count five, ten (10) years' imprisonment.  Count six, twelve (12) years' imprisonment.  Count eight, eight (8) years' imprisonment.\n\tHe applies for amnesty in this hearing in respect of these convictions and in addition, in respect of his participation and activities in connection with an operation to bomb the Yeoville Police Station.  Part of such activities constituted the subject matter of count seven at the above said proceedings.  Applicant was acquitted on this count at the trial.\n\tAlthough there are several incidents referred to in the application, only the matters referred to above were heard before us.  The others having been either heard during other hearings of the Amnesty Committee or held in abeyance pending other developments.  The co-accused of the applicant in the trial had been given notice of and were present at the hearing.  The family of the late Constable Jacob Hlomela Mabaso had also received notice, but declined to be present at the hearing.  Sergeant Edward Nelushi and Ian Alexander Veldman also received notice and were present at the hearing.  Their, and other victims' interests, were represented by the Leader of Evidence, Mr Zuko Mapoma.\n\tThe applicant testified and confirmed the contents of his affidavit which forms part of the record before us.  He clarified the source and basis for his orders which resulted in the two incidents and the consequences.  We do not regard it necessary to traverse the facts in any detail.\n\tApplicant said he had been deployed in the Gauteng area in early 1993.  He and his unit had been planning various operations, including the attack upon the Yeoville Police Station.  He was a regional commander with several units under his command.  On 26 May 1993 the security forces launched a series of raids and operations against the PAC and APLA.  This was during the negotiation process and as a consequence he received the instructions from the director of special operations, one Sipho Bulelani Quma, code name Polite, to launch operations against the SAP in his area.  All of the incidents dealt with in the application were special operations undertaken pursuant to this order.\n\tHaving conducted reconnaissance, the applicant, together with his co-accused, one Musa and one Kenny, launched an attack upon a police van on 28 May 1993.  The occupants of the vehicle were Constable Mabaso, the driver, and Sergeant Nelushi.  It is common cause that Constable Mabaso died in the attack and that Sergeant Nelushi was severely injured in the attack.  On the following day, 29 May 1993, the applicant instructed his co-accused and Musa in the use of the explosives referred to in paragraph 14, at page 18 of the bundle before us which explosives he had requisitioned via a courier from Sipho Bulelani Quma, who was at the time in the then Transkei and sent them to carry out the operation to bomb the Yeoville Police Station.  It seems evidence from the testimony of the applicant and other documents that the police were aware of this operation and arrested the co-accused of the applicant before the explosives could be placed and any harm done.\n\tOn 30 May 1993 the applicant was arrested after having been wounded in an exchange of fire with members of the police.  At the time of his arrest he was in possession of the items referred to in counts three, four, five and six.  That in essence was the evidence on behalf of the applicant.\n\tSergeant Nelushi testified as to the circumstances of the attack, the death of his friend and colleague and his injuries and the consequences thereof.  He did not oppose the application and expressed no ill-feelings towards the applicant.  Mr Mapoma had placed on record that none of the other victims were opposing the application.  No other evidence was led before us.\n\tThere can be no doubt that the applicant was cadre of APLA.  His actions as set out above were all within the ambit of the policies of both APLA and the PAC.  We may mention that the Commission has had extensive evidence and received submissions detailing such policies and strategies.  The applicant's conduct falls, in our view, within such framework and accordingly are held to be acts associated with a political objective as envisaged in Section 20(2), read with Section 20(3) of the Act.\n\tWith regard to the issue of full disclosure.  We are satisfied that the applicant has made full disclosure of all material facts.  He has not tried to minimise the nature and extent of his involvement and has further applied for amnesty for an aspect for which he was acquitted in the trial.  He has also disclosed additional facts which evidenced his bona fides in this regard.  The applicant was not from the area where these events took place and had no personal interest or agenda in respect of the persons injured or killed who were all unknown to him.  There is no suggestion that he acted for personal gain.\n\tAccordingly, we grant the applicant amnesty in respect of the following\n1.\tThe murder of Jacob Hlomela Mabaso on 28 May 1993 at Diepkloof in the then Transvaal.\n2.\tThe attempted murder of Edward Nelushi on 28 May 1993 at Diepkloof in the then Transvaal.\n3.\tThe attempted murder of Ian Alexander Veldman on 30 May 1993 at Diepkloof in the then Transvaal.\n4.\tUnlawful possession of machine guns.\n5.\tUnlawful possession of ammunition intended to be fired from a machine gun or machine rifle or any similar armament.\n6.\tUnlawful possession of any explosive or incendiary device or any part thereof.\n7.\tUnlawful possession of any grenade.\n8.\tAll acts in relation to the planning, orders and preparation of the failed bombing of the Yeoville Police Station on 29 May 1993, including the unlawful possession of explosives, possession of 2kg of plastic explosive, one Chinese stick grenade and 250 grams of TNT.  \n\tThe matter of the death of Jacob Hlomela Mabaso and the attempted murders of Edward Nelushi and Ian Veldman are referred to the Reparations and Rehabilitation Committee pursuant to the provisions of Section 22(1) of the Act.  That is the decision in respect of the matter of Phila Martin Dolo.  \n\tThat concludes the proceedings for today.  As has been indicated earlier, the matter of Mr Mvijane stands down until 9 o'clock tomorrow or as soon thereafter as the matter may be heard.  We are adjourned.  Just for purposes of completion, the decisions which were handed down this afternoon would be communicated to the Department of Correctional Services as per the normal procedure which applies to matters of this nature.  We adjourn.",

            "Can I in the meantime call the matters of Mvijane, 7355/97 and Khwankwa, 3868/96, for the purposes of the decision which I now present.\n\tThe first applicant is Nkosinathi Mpumelelo Mvijane, born on 16 March 1972 and previously resident in Pimville, Gauteng.  The second applicant is Lulamile Khwankwa, born on 10 September 1971 and also previously resident in Pimville, Gauteng.\n\tBoth applicants were arraigned and convicted in the Witwatersrand Local Division of the then Supreme Court on 25 March 1993 in case number 42/92 on the following charges\n1.\tMurder.\n2.\tRobbery with aggravating circumstances.\n3.\tUnlawful possession of firearms, namely a 7,65mm automatic pistol in respect of first applicant only, and a 9mm pistol in respect of both applicants.\n4.\tUnlawful possession of ammunition.\nThey were each sentenced on 9 August 1993 as follows\n1.\tMurder, twenty five (25) years' imprisonment.\n2.\tRobbery, ten (10) years' imprisonment.\n3.\tUnlawful possession of firearms\n3.1\tFirst applicant in respect of the 7,65mm automatic pistol, five (5) years' imprisonment;\n\t3.2\tBoth applicants in respect of the 9mm pistol, five (5) years' imprisonment.\n4.\tUnlawful possession of ammunition, one (1) year imprisonment.\nThe sentences in respect of counts two, three and four were ordered to run concurrently resulting in an effective sentence of thirty five (35) years' imprisonment for each applicant.  They are currently serving those sentences.\n\tApplicants have applied for amnesty pursuant to the provisions of Section 18 of the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation, Act 34 of 1995, in respect of the above said convictions.  All the said charges arose from an incident on 20 August 1991 at Area 6, Pimville, Gauteng when one Simon Makudu Khungwane, a traffic officer, was shot and killed and robbed of his service pistol, a 9mm Baretta.  The 7,65mm pistol referred to in count three, was used in the attack upon the deceased.\n\tBoth applicants testified and called a witness Jabulani Joseph Khumalo in support of their applications.  The evidence was not in dispute.\n\tJohanna and Leonard Khungwane, respectively the sister and brother of the deceased, also testified.  They both indicated that they are opposing the applications, even though they were unable to testify as to the merits of the incident in issue.  We will return to their evidence.\n\tFirst applicant had deposed to an affidavit which forms part of the record before us, and basically confirmed its contents in his testimony.  His version briefly summarised is to the effect that he is a member of the Pan Africanist Congress, the PAC, as well as the Azanian People's Liberation Army, APLA.  He joined both organisations during 1991, after having been recruited together with second applicant by an APLA cadre from Tanzania known as Moss.  He joined an APLA unit together with second applicant and one Doctor, under the command of Moss who gave them basic military training.  It was their duty as APLA operatives to repossess arms from, inter alia, members of the security forces, including traffic cops.  These persons were the main pillars of apartheid and had to be attacked to render apartheid unworkable.\n\tDuring the night of 19 August 1991 their unit was on patrol searching for an appropriate target for attack.  They were unsuccessful and on the morning of 20 August 1991 they retired home.  First applicant and Doctor were on their way to the latter's home when they saw the deceased in the street and decided to disarm him.  First applicant ordered the deceased not to move, but had to shoot him when the deceased tried to draw his firearm.  Doctor took the firearm of the deceased and they ran away.  On the way they met second applicant, went to survey the scene of the incident after he was told what had happened.  They reported the incident and handed the deceased's firearm to Moss.  Second applicant joined them and informed them that there was an eyewitness to the incident and that they should expect the police to search for them soon.  They collected all their arms and left for a hide-out.  Applicants were subsequently arrested.\n\tBoth applicants testified that they were delinquents who engaged in criminal activities and gangsterism prior to being recruited by Moss and are now rehabilitated.  This much is born out by their criminal records and is common cause.\n\tSecond applicant confirmed the evidence of first applicant in all material respects.  He testified that he was not present when the deceased was shot, but agreed with the action taken as being within their duty as members of APLA.  He subsequently assisted the others in the manner which is set out above.  He clearly associated himself with the attack upon the deceased.\n\tMr Khumalo testified that he's a member of the PAC National Executive and a member of their Cabinet.  At the time of the incident he was the chairperson of the PAC, Katlehong branch.  He was aware of the incident in question and confirmed the status of Moss as a member of APLA and that the attack was sanctioned by the PAC and APLA.  He testified in great detail about the assistance he had given Moss who was wounded in a shootout with the police after the arrest of the applicants who had taken the police to Moss' place.  The latter, that is Moss, informed the witness that he had recruited some criminals whose lack of political sense and experience resulted in the police tracking him down and wounding him.  This was an obvious reference to the applicants.  Moss had subsequently died in another incident.  APLA had taken responsibility for the attack upon the deceased.  His evidence was not attacked in any way and stands uncontroverted.\n\tIn all the circumstances of the case, we have no hesitation in accepting the case presented to us on behalf of the applicants.  We accordingly find that the applicants had made a full disclosure and that the attack upon the deceased was an act associated with a political objective pursuant to the provisions of Section 20 of the Act.  We are particularly fortified in the latter conclusion by the testimony of Mr Khumalo who has made a particularly good impression as a witness, and has dispelled any doubts that could arise in this regard in view of the particular background of the applicants as set out above.  \n\tAlthough second applicant did not physically participate in the attack upon the deceased, he clearly associated himself with the incident to such an extent as to render him legally liable.  We are satisfied that the applicants have met all the requirements set out in the Act and they are accordingly granted amnesty in respect of the following offences\n(a)\tThe murder of Simon Makudu Khungwane at Pimville, Gauteng on 20 August 1991;\n(b)\tThe robbery of the said Simon Makudu Khungwane of a 9mm Baretta pistol at the place and date set out in paragraph (a);\n(c)\tUnlawful possession of a 9mm Baretta and a 7.65mm automatic pistol at the place and date set out in paragraph (a);\n(d)\tUnlawful possession of an unknown number of rounds of 9mm and 7,65mm ammunition at the place and date set out in paragraph (a).\n\tIn the course of their testimony, the sister and brother of the deceased expressed the understandable pain and anger of the family at the loss of their loved one.  They also addressed ...[end of tape] ...[inaudible] the case and in an attempt to facilitate a possible process of reconciliation, we allowed Mr Khumalo, upon his request, an opportunity to address the family of the deceased.  He extended a sterling apology to the family, and made a passionate plea that the family would be able to accept the apology and be able to eventually put the pain of the incident behind them.  We are hopeful that the seeds have been planted for a process of healing for the family of the deceased.\n\tIn conclusion, we are of the opinion that Beauty Thembi Ngubane and Sipho Khungwane, respectively the wife and the son of the deceased are victims in relation to the death of the deceased.  The matter is accordingly referred to the Committee on Reparations and Rehabilitation for its consideration in terms of Section 26 of the Act.  That is the decision in respect of Mvijane and Khwankwa.\n\tThat also concludes our sitting here.  In conclusion, on behalf of the panel, we would like to thank all of those people who had assisted in making it possible for us to have this sitting, in particular the members of our staff, logistics and other members of staff, including the interpretation services which normally and usually will fill quite a key role in making our proceedings accessible to members of the public which is a very important aspect of our work.  We are also expressing our thanks to the members of the police and the Correctional Services for the role that they have been playing in assisting us in having the sitting.  \n\tIn conclusion, I think we owe a special word of thanks to Mr Mbandazayo who had represented all of the applicants who had appeared before us, in some instances on very short notice and under circumstances which he had obviously not anticipated he would be called upon to do so.  We're indebted to him for his assistance as well as to our leader of evidence, Mr Zuko Mapoma.  And in conclusion, my thanks goes to my colleagues on the panel with me, Advocate Sigodi and Mr Lax, for assisting me in hearing these matters.  That concludes the hearing and we are now adjourned.

            "CHAIRPERSON",
            "Today is the 4th of February and we are ready to pronounce our decision in respect of an amnesty application of Mr Solomon Collen Mtambo which was heard yesterday.\n\tMr Mtambo applied in terms of section 18 of the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act 34 of 1995.   He applied in respect  of his conviction, which was on the 13th of June 1995 at Secunda for the murder of Mshewu Phumalo at Kwadela Darville on the 29th of May 1993.   \n\tFor this offence he was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment which he is currently serving at Barberton Prison.\n\tNotices in terms of section 94 of the Act had been served on the deceased's family and Mr Trevor Phumalo, a cousin of the deceased, testified on their behalf.\n\tThe applicant was represented by Mr D Claassen and he testified in support of his application.   He confirmed his applications and the affidavit which forms part of the papers.   We do not intend to traverse the evidence of the applicant in detail.   Suffice it to say he was not an impressive witness.   His testimony was fraught with numerous inconsistencies and contradictions.   It also differed in material respects with the allegations or versions contained in his applications and the affidavit referred to above.   When asked to explain these numerous inconsistencies, he conceded that he had lied in his applications, in his indemnity application and in the affidavit to the TRC's investigation unit, in court during his trial, in a statement which he made to the police during the investigation of the crime for which he was later convicted.    \n\tOne such instance of this kind of a problem with his evidence is that in his application, he refers to the incident in which he shot the deceased and the reasons why he did so.   At page 3 of the papers, paragraph 10(b) he says, and we quote him-\n\"I wanted my party to be the one who take over the election of the provincial by eliminating some of the members of the opposition party.\"\n\tAt page 5 of the papers, paragraph 11, he says, we quote him-\n\"The motive was that my organisation win the April 1994 elections by killing prominent members of the ANC in my area.\"\n\tAt page 8 of the papers, he however says, at paragraph 9(a)(4), we quote him-\n\"I shot dead Mr Mshewu Phumalo on self defence after he attempted to shoot me.\"\n\tAt page 10 of the papers, paragraph 10(b), he however says-\n\"The deceased was killed due to the political motive that existed at that stage as I knew that if Mr Phumalo can be eliminated, our party will gain recognition as he was the only stumbling block towards achieving our political goals.\"\n\tAt page 28 and 29 of the papers, at paragraph 3 therein, he describes a different version of the incident, and in paragraph 5 implies that the reason he killed the deceased was his refusal to end the fight between the IFP and the ANC.   \n\tHowever, in his viva voce evidence before us, he stated that he wanted to kill the deceased inter alia so as to intimidate ANC people into joining the IFP, because the deceased was brave and led assaults and attacks on IFP supporters, and also because the deceased had told him he had made a vow to kill him, him being the applicant, and he was scared of him.\n\tThe applicant testified that he had taken the decision to kill the deceased on his own and that he wanted to hide his own participation in the commission of the crime so as not to bring the IFP into disrepute.   How then would he be able to achieve his stated purpose of intimidating ANC supporters to joining the IFP and thereby increasing the IFP's membership if that is so?\n\tIt is clear to us that this and other instances of non-disclosure are aimed inter alia at establishing a political context to support the applicant's assertion that his acts were associated with a political objective.   \n\tIn the result, we as a committee, are not satisfied that the applicant has complied with section 20.2 of the Act and his application is accordingly REFUSED.   That is our decision.",

When it \nwas said to me that the insurgents are busy crossing the border and that they were \ncarrying bags with them, the observation post didn't notify me whether the people had \ntheir firearms outside and that reassured me that the planning would fall within the \nframework of our planning, because it would have been an unheard of thing for \ninsurgents to drive around, showing their firearms openly.\n\tIt would have been very risky.  For that reason, I believed that when we \nstopped the vehicle and threw the hand grenade to cause shock and confusion, that by \nthe time the insurgents have taken out their firearms, cocked them, etc, that they at \nthat stage already would have realised that here is an armed vehicle and weapons are \naimed at us, uniformed people surrounding us etc.\n\tThat is why I believed that we will be able to arrest the insurgents without \nthem really offering any resistance and then when I saw through the window how the \npassenger in the left front shot through the window and that Captain Born collapsed, \nand I then also heard a short volley of shots, it is true we are trained, I myself am \ntrained in the case of contact with insurgents, you deliver maximum fire power to \nprotect your own life and not as in the normal situation.  You are trained in that \nsituation, to give the maximum fire until there is no resistance left.\n\tI must also mention it to the Chairperson, that when I started firing, I fired at \nthe combi and at the passengers.\n\tThere was teargas so I couldn't see very clearly, I couldn't see very clearly \nwhere each person, each passenger was sitting, I just fired.",

This doubt is based on the fact that Dr \nDe'Oliviera thought it necessary to investigate the matter and Archbishop Desmond \nTutu has said on many occasions, where you have any doubt, you should rather apply \nfor amnesty in the spirit of reconciliation to put all the facts on the table.\n\tThe National Commissioner also thought it necessary to arrange a special \noccasion in Pretoria to put it to us that if we should have any doubt, that we should \nrather apply for amnesty in the spirit of national unity and reconciliation.\n\tFurther Chairperson, from experience I know that courts take days and weeks \nto hear matters and it takes trial within a trial to determine whether we exceeded the \nbounds at a shooting incident, for instance.  And as far as a possible charge of \nobstructing the course of justice is concerned, I am very honest when I say to the \nCommission, that the handling of the inquest docket, I did not include all the  \n(indistinct) of sequences in this docket, because I believed that that which I did include \nin the docket, in the inquest docket, was sufficient to enable the Presiding Officer to \nmake a finding in this inquest.\n\tAnd if it should be found that I committed an obstruction of justice, I ask for \namnesty for that in the spirit of the promotion of national unity and reconciliation.",

I can still remember that Mr Jaap Strydom assisted by Mr Jan Vermaak of Cradock during May 1985, visited him and met with interested parties, including Major Calitz, the then District Commander, Mr Gerber, Commissioner Marais and myself held to discuss whether Mr Goniwe should be re-appointed as teacher.  The idea was also mentioned to appoint Mrs Molly Blackburn as mediator and the possibility of her appointment at Graaff Reinet.\nMy personal feeling was that I was not opposed to the re-appointment of Mr Goniwe at Cradock.  Insofar as this was the function concerning Divisional Headquarters at Port Elizabeth, to Headquarters in Pretoria and what happened there, I am not able to divulge information about.  Information that was in possession of PE Headquarters did not come from Security Branch, Cradock, but would have come from several sources, from several parts of the country.  It therefore follows that any information was given to the top position from Port Elizabeth branch, did not necessarily come from the Cradock branch.\"\n\tNow, is that a correct description of what was happening at the time?",

He says \nJack was what was called an askari.  And then he explains, in other \nwords he was a trained ANC activist who at that stage was working \nfor the police.\n\tAnd he then says but at that stage he had put out feelers to \nreturn to the ANC fold.  Then the court asks him, you say he had \nput out feelers and then he then says, Mr Mostert then says, he put \nout feelers to return to the ANC fold.  My Lord, as far as Mgoduka \nis concerned, our information is that in respect of Mgoduka too, his \nloyalty was being questioned.  So it is in the same context in which \nreference is made to this inquest.

The attack was approximately 150m from a Swaziland Defence Force base \nand we could not hang around there for too long, so the house was not searched thoroughly. \n\tAfter the operation we went back to Oshoek and crossed the border near the border post back into \nthe Republic. Thereafter I contacted Brigadier Schoon and informed him that we had killed two persons. \n\tThe following morning De Kok and I drove to Pretoria where I handed the documents which we \nhad seized to General Steenkamp. Before I left I had arranged that Geoff Besigu be treated in the Ermelo \nHospital. Thereafter I was merited with an award for outstanding service and also De Kok, Van Dyk, \nPienaar and Rohrig. Geoff Besigu and Nofamela were both promoted to the ranks of sergeant as well as Joe \nMamasela. \tMamasela played a big role in the preliminary investigation into Nyanda but he was not \nthere that night and for this reason he was also promoted. The medals which were awarded to me were \nhanded over by the ex-Minister of police,  Louis LeGrange. \n\tWhen I entered the room where McFadden, the man whom I had shot, and I hadn't known at that \nstage, I had no choice but to shoot at him. I did not know whether he was armed or not and whether he \nwould have shot me or not. The normal reaction in such a case is to shoot. We expected that everyone \nshould have been armed, everyone inside the house, and where such an attack was launched, there was no \ntime to ask the person whether or not they were armed first. I assumed that he was a member of the ANC - \nthat he assisted Nyanda and that he would probably have been armed. \n\tThis operation has to be seen in the light of the \nPRETORIA HEARING\tAMNESTY/",
