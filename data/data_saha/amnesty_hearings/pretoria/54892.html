<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>ADV MPSHE:   Thank you Mr Chairperson and members of the Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a>	Mr Chairman before we start with the leading of evidence may I request that counsels herein </p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a>present today for the first time be put on record.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a>MR S VAN DER MERWE:   Thank you Mr Chairman.	My name is S W van der Merwe, I appear on </p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a>behalf of Mr Eric Winter who is implicated in the application of Mr Venter in relation to the PEPCO Three.   </p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a>MS H KRUGER:  Thank you Mr Chairman.  My name is H Kruger, I appear on behalf of General Smit </p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a>who is implicated according to a notice received on 21 February in the matter of Dr Ribiero and his wife.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a>JUDGE MALL:  There is little likelihood of these matters being reached during the course of today - Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a>Mpshe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a>ADV MPSHE:  Mr Chairman, there is a likelihood that we may deal with he PEPCO three today but there </p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a>is no likelihood of dealing with Dr Ribiero and his wife's matter today.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Yes.  Well, Mrs Kruger then you may be, unless you wish to stay on you will be excused </p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a>from further attendance and I think it is hoped that we will reach your matter sometime tomorrow.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a>MS KRUGER:  Thank you Mr Chairperson. I will return tomorrow.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a>166</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Mr Mpshe, we understand that General van der Merwe is going to give evidence </p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a>tomorrow morning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a>ADV. MPSHE:  Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Is it your intention that immediately thereafter you will be dealing with the matter in </p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a>which Mrs Kruger is appearing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a>ADV. MPSHE:   Mr Chairman may I suggest that Mrs Kruger be here tomorrow at 2.00 o'clock so as to be </p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a>sure that at the time she arrives we shall be through with the other matters as per schedule, Mr Chairman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Mrs Kruger, will it inconvenience you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a>MRS KRUGER:  No. Not all. I will be available tomorrow afternoon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Thank you very much.	The letters that you mentioned earlier, thanks very much, </p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a>copies of those have now come to my hand - the letters written by you to the Amnesty Committee here in </p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a>Johannesburg. Thanks very much for those letters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a>	Mr Mpshe, in the other matter that you are going to be dealing with today, is there no likelihood </p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a>of Mrs Kruger's client being implicated in it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a>ADV MPSHE:  Mr Chairman, not to my knowledge because I went through the applications myself and I </p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a>issued all notices to people who are implicated as per applications, I don't know if this may be the case </p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a>inasfar as the mention of names at the hearing is concerned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a>JUDGE MALL:  But as far as you are concerned at present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a>ADV MPSHE:  As per applications, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a>JUDGE WILSON:	(Aside discussion with Chairman) What about van der Merwe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a>167</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a>JUDGE MALL:	What about him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a>JUDGE WILSON:	Might he not implicate your client?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a>JUDGE MALL:  He has not - cross-examination.  Mrs Kruger we don't know what is going to happen </p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a>during the evidence of Mr van der Merwe when he is going to be cross-examined tomorrow and at this </p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a>stage one doesn't know whether there will be any mention made of your client in his cross-examination, but </p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a>perhaps you might just monitor the situation and make yourself available if it transpires that you have an </p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a>interest in the matter in what he says.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  We have not had any clear evidence as to how their duties overlapped, but I have no </p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a>doubt he will be able to tell you whether they were working in the same office and his name may be </p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a>mentioned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a>JUDGE MALL:  At any rate, in his evidence-in-chief, which has been read into the record, your client is </p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a>not implicated in that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a>MS KRUGER:  I have got no problem to attend then if I understand you correctly, tomorrow morning </p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a>when General van der Merwe is going to testify.   Will you then excuse me until tomorrow morning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Yes, certainly. Thank you. </p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a>ADV MPSHE:  Mr Chairman, then the next issue is the issue on which the Committee was approached in </p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a>chambers by Advocate Visser and Advocate du Plessis.  The Committee gave an indication that it would be </p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a>dealt with right at the beginning before we commence leading evidence.   That pertains to the report, Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a>Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Yes. Mr Visser.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a>MR VISSER:   May it please you Mr Chairman.  The reason why we believed that it is important to </p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a>mention this in open </p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a>MR VISSER	168	ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a>Committee will appear from a report dated 25 February 1997 in the "Beeld" and I refer your attention </p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a>specifically to the last column in the middle to the following words.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a>		"Advocate du Plessis said that the five mens' then seniors were not prepared to provide </p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a>the information. The general attitude of the security forces towards the Truth and </p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a>Reconciliation Commission is negative. The general feeling is that the Commission </p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a>should not be assisted".</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:    Mr Chairman I wish to place on record, that nothing could be further from the truth </p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a>regarding my clients, they have filed applications for amnesty. General van der Merwe has offered his </p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a>evidence and is going to testify tomorrow. </p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a>	I wish us just to keep two matters separate.	The one is the "alleged non-assistance of the five </p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a>applicants" before you now and what is stated here in the newspaper "assistance to your committee". Now </p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a>we say that there is no grounds for drawing the inference, and the inference is in fact false and we wish to </p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a>place that on record, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Thank you. We trust that there will be more responsible reporting by newspaper reporters </p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a>of proceedings before this Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a>MR VISSER:  Well, except Mr Chairman that apparently according to my learned friend Mr Mpshe, my </p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a>learned friend Mr du Plessis did in fact say this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a>JUDGE MALL:   Yes. Inaccurate report. </p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  (Aside to Chairman)	It's an accurate report -JUDGE MALL:  	Yes, but it is </p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a>the wrong impression created. JUDGE WILSON:   Well his counsel said it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a>JUDGE MALL:   Yes.	Thank you very much for having placed </p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a>169</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a>this on record.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a>MR VISSER:  Thank you Mr Chairman, I take it no further than that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a>JUDGE MALL:   You wish to comment on that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Yes, please Mr Chairman. Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a>	Mr Chairman, I did say this, in argument.  It is true that the applicants, in October, when they </p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a>prepared for their evidence, did approach certain persons to request them to be of assistance and they did </p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a>have a lot of trouble with that. I do not withdraw any submission that I did make yesterday. </p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a>JUDGE MALL:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  In respect of Mr Visser's clients, I can place on record that most of them were </p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a>represented by Mr Wagner, we did not approach them to help us at that stage or before this hearing, but </p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a>what I want to emphasise again is that we did give evidence and it is not simply just an argument, it was </p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a>evidence by Brigadier Cronje and Captain Hechter as far as I can recall that their superiors of that time, and </p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a>specifically of the National Party has not assisted the applicants, has not offered the applicants any </p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a>assistance whatsoever. I still stand by the view that we have difficulty and had difficulty finding witnesses </p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a>pertaining to certain aspects and it was in that context that I addressed the argument to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a>	The second point I want to make in this regard is that we are grateful for the assistance of General </p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a>van der Merwe to our clients - who is a client of Mr Visser and Mr Wagner. He graciously agreed to assist </p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a>the applicants and the Committee at the time when we started with these hearings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	169	ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a>	What I want to emphasise is that clearly my reference to people who do not want to assist the </p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a>Commission, could not have included Mr Visser's clients for the pure and simple reason that it was </p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a>knowledge at that time that all his clients applied for amnesty and that they are working together with the </p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a>Committee and are part of this process. That is an important point that I want to place on record. </p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a>	Furthermore, in respect of what was said "Die algemede houding van die veiligheids magte" it </p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a>was simply a general reference, "a general attitude of the security forces", about the general attitude of </p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a>members of the South African Defence Force for instance and I made that statement as a general statement. </p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a>It obviously didn't include people who are willing to participate in the process and it obviously didn't </p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a>include Mr Visser's clients.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a>	Mr Visser acts on behalf of 81 former South African Police members and, therefore, clearly he </p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a>cannot speak for the whole South African Security Forces including the South African Defence Force or </p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a>other policemen. We ourselves act for other policemen as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a>	And then lastly, I want to say, Mr Chairman, that we are very appreciative of the fact that Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a>Visser has indicated that his clients intend to cooperate with the Commission and with us and we would </p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a>appreciate it if it could be possible for us, and we would discuss that with Mr Visser, if it would be possible </p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a>for us to perhaps have consultations with some of his clients who might be able to assist the applicants in </p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a>providing the Commission with important and necessary information which his clients might have and </p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a>might possess. Obviously, we do not want to drag the proceedings out and we will limit it to just the </p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	170	ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a>necessary information but, we deem it important that the Committee obtains evidence pertaining to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a>order structure and the workings of the State Security Council and if they can be of assistance to us, we </p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a>would gratefully appreciate it. Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Well, I have no doubt that that is a matter that you and Mr Visser would be able to work </p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a>out. This Committee can hardly direct Mr Visser and tell him that he should instruct his clients to render </p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a>assistance, I have no doubt that that is a matter that experienced legal men like you would be able to </p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a>resolve amongst yourselves.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Yes, Mr Chairman, I will definitely endeavour to do so and we are grateful for the </p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a>fact that they have indicated in public that they are prepared to assist the Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a>MR VISSER:  Mr Chairman, if I may by way of reply. The matter seems to have resolved itself by my </p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a>learned friend now stating publicly, that his remarks were not intended to reflect on my clients and I am </p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a>sure Die Beeld's reporter who is here will rectify that in a next edition. Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Yes. Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a>ADV MPSHE:  Mr Chairman, yesterday when we adjourned we were busy with the matter no. 3. on Day 1 </p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a>"Interrogation of Scheepers Morudu" my learned friend Mr Brian Currin was to sum up that matter. I hand </p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a>over to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a>MR CURRIN:  Mr Chairman, that is correct, you will recall that we were to call Scheepers Morudu and I </p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a>will do that in a moment but before I do that and very briefly, there is an issue of importance that just needs </p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a>to be raised before you, I did discuss it with you previously.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a>MR CURRIN	171	ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a>	As you will recall, Mr Chairman, on the 6th February, we approached, on behalf of the victims, </p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a>the Committee to subpoena a group of witnesses in regard to the whole question of the line of command, </p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a>the issue of trivets and cooperation between the SAP and the SADF, time is becoming important because </p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a>of the fact that if they, depending on your eventual ruling, if they are to be subpoenaed they need to be </p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a>given sufficient notice, and I just would, because I have instructions from the victims who are affected, to </p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a>raise with you now in the forum, the written application which we filed with the further motivation earlier </p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a>this week in regard to Brig. Victor, Brig. Schoon, Col. Louw, Gen. Buchner, Gen. Beukes, the former </p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a>Minister of Law and Order - Adriaan Vlok, the former Minister of Defence - Magnus Malan and the </p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a>former State President - P W Botha, to hear whether you have had an opportunity to consider the matter </p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a>and what your position is in regard to calling these witnesses. As I indicated and particularly with regard to </p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a>the Zero handgrenade case, where we in fact heard from General van der Merwe, who at the time was head </p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a>of the Security Police that he had taken up the matter with the then Commissioner Johan Coetzee, who in </p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a>turn had discussed the issue with the then Minister of Law and Order - Louis LeGrange - and he believed </p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a>that that had then been discussed with P W Botha. Now our clients are obviously keen to hear about that </p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a>chain of command and it is for that purpose, inter alia that we made the application and we would just like </p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a>you to give us an indication as to your views on the application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  Mr Currin, we reserved judgment I think on Monday, we reserved judgement and </p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a>obviously as soon as the </p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a>MR CURRIN	171	ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a>judgement is at hand we will give it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a>MR CURRIN:  I am sorry, there must have then been an misunderstanding, I didn't understand that to be </p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a>the case, I was asked to make a written submission, which I did, and it hasn't really been discussed in an </p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a>open forum since then and my clients obviously were keen to hear what the situation is and it is for that </p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a>reason that I raised it, and I did raise it with Judge Mall this morning before the sitting began and said I </p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a>would raise it and he said it would be in order.</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  You circulated submission, written submissions to us, didn't you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a>MR CURRIN:  That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  And we indicated that we would consider them and as soon as we have considered </p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a>them we would make a ruling.</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a>MR CURRIN:  That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:   But we are going to do that and as soon as we have reached a decision we will let you </p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a>know without delay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a>MR CURRIN:  I accept that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a>JUDGE MALL:  We understand the purpose for which you require these people to be subpoenaed, your </p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a>concern about the chain of command and how far it extends, there has been some evidence in that regard, I </p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a>have no doubt that when General van der Merwe comes, a great deal more light may be throw and </p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a>whatever difficulties there may be, a lot of them may be cleared up and we may have a better </p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a>understanding of this chain of command. There is likely perhaps to be other evidence as well apart from </p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a>General van der Merwe. The Committee would like to take its decision after it hears </p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a>172</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a>that evidence because it does not want to rush into subpoenaing people to give evidence when a great deal </p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a>of that evidence may become clear through other witnesses.  So Mr Currin I think that your clients, I have </p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a>no doubt you will advise your clients that due consideration will be given, but we would like to decide on </p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a>precisely who of these people should be subpoenaed if we feel that it is necessary to do so and then we will </p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a>let you know, but we would like to take that decision ultimately after we have heard evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a>MR CURRIN:  I accept that ruling, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  Mr Chairman I now sincerely hope that we are going to get started and hear evidence </p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a>in respect of a matter, which for that matter should have been heard on Monday.  We hope that there is now </p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a>going to be progress and we hope that we are going to hear evidence. </p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a>ADV MPSHE:  Thank you Sir. That will be so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a>MR VISSER:  Mr Chairman, at the risk of being out of order, and if I am so, please rule me so. I have now </p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a>heard for the first time of an application for apparently Section 29 for notices to be given to certain people </p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a>of which some are some of my clients, I am not certain how the Committee deals with such an application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a>JUDGE MALL:  The Committee will take into account the fact that these people have applied - a number </p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a>of them have themselves applied for amnesty - it is a factor that the Committee is going to take into </p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a>account.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a>MR VISSER:  Yes.  I was just wondering - we would have liked to have made some submissions but we </p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a>are obviously - we might be out of order you having reserved your judgement at this point in time. I just </p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a>wanted to place that on record </p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a>MR VISSER	173	ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a>that we were unaware, completely unaware of this application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a>JUDGE MALL:   Well, if you are unaware it is unfortunate that that was so but the Amnesty Committee </p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a>itself could not have warned your beforehand that this was going to happen. An application was made on </p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a>Monday and if you haven't a copy of that, you should get it from Mr Currin and study it, but my remarks </p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a>that I have made about when we will give our decision and so on, stands.</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a>MR VISSER:  Yes, I understand that, that is why I said I would probably be out of order, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a>MR CURRIN:   May I, just for the record, state that the surname is MORUDU, M-O-R-U-D-U, and not </p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a>Morudi as stated  in the documentation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a>SCHEEPERS MORUDU:   (sworn duly states) </p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a>EXAMINATION BY MR CURRIN:  Mr Morudu what is your date of birth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a>MR MORUDU:  6th June 1969.</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a>MR CURRIN:  In what standard at school were you in when this incident occurred?</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a>MR MORUDU:  I was doing Std. 8.</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Was it Std. 8 or Form 8?</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a>MR MORUDU:  Std. 8.</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a>MR CURRIN:  Where were you at school?</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a>MR MORUDU:  Letlahbile High School.</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a>MR CURRIN:  Could you tell the Committee a little bit about your involvement in student affairs or </p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a>student politics?</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a>MR MORUDU:  In 1986 I was elected the Deputy Chairperson of the Mamelodi Students Congress.</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a>MR CURRIN:  I see. What were the activities of the Mamelodi PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a>MR CURRIN	174	S MORUDU</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a>Students' Congress, what was the nature of those activities?</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a>MR MORUDU:  The most aim was to get the students back to class and organise them and like fighting for </p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a>the things like free books for students.</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a>MR CURRIN:  Were you a member of any political organisation at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a>MR MORUDU:  No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a>MR CURRIN:  You have heard evidence that you were involved in bombings, petrol bombings and other </p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a>acts of violence, what is your response to that evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a>MR MORUDU:  That is untrue. I was never involved in any violent acts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a>MR CURRIN:  I see. You have also heard evidence that you were severally tortured, the version of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a>torture that you heard before the Committee, is that a correct version, would you like to add anything to </p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a>that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a>MR MORUDU:  What I would like to add on that is that they didn't use that shocking device of them on </p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a>my hands or my legs, it was used on my private parts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a>MR CURRIN:  Is there anything else that you would like to add with regard to the actual torture?</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a>MR MORUDU:  What I can just add is that these people before interrogating me they first started by </p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a>assaulting me severely without asking any questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a>MR CURRIN:  Did they tell you what the purpose of the assault and interrogation was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a>MR MORUDU:  No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a>MR CURRIN:  What did they say to you during or after the torture?</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a>MR MORUDU:  What they told me to do was to write down the names of the members of my Executive </p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a>on a piece of paper.</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a>MR CURRIN	174	S MORUDU</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a>MR CURRIN:  Did you eventually do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a>MR MORUDU:  Yes. I was under duress. I had to do it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a>MR CURRIN:  I see. Did they threaten you at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a>MR MORUDU:  Yes, they threatened me, they swore at me and they were talking a lot of things to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a>MR CURRIN:  What did they say when they threatened you, what did they threatened that they would do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a>MR MORUDU:  They threatened to kill me if I don't cooperate with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a>MR CURRIN:   And you then became an informer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a>MR MORUDU:  That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a>MR CURRIN:  How do you feel about that and what has that done to you as a person and to your life, will </p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a>you just share that with the Committee please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a>MR MORUDU:  This act ruined my life and I could not walk safe in the township and each and every </p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a>person suspected me of (...indistinct) and even today I knew that my conscience was clear, I wouldn't have </p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a>collaborated with them and they knew that for a fact when they interrogated me and that is why they </p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a>brought in Mr Mamasela to come and talk to me - whereby I even refused.  And when one of them left the </p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a>office, Joe Mamasela told me in no uncertain terms that I am going to die if I don't work with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Just repeat that, I didn't hear Mamasela told you what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a>MR MORUDU:  That van Vuuren and Hechter and together with him, they are going to kill me if I do not </p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a>work with them. That was their main intention if I do not work with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a>MR CURRIN:  You probably heard the evidence of I think it was Warrant Officer Van Vuuren, he said </p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a>that if you did not work with them they probably would have killed you?</p>

<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a>MR MORUDU:  Yes, I heard that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a>MR CURRIN:  How do you feel about amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a>MR MORUDU:  In this matter which is - which they are asking for amnesty on this matter of which I am </p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a>involved, I would ask this Committee not to give them amnesty because they didn't even come to me </p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a>before they saw me on Monday and they didn't even make attempts of coming to me myself as a person </p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a>and ask for forgiveness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a>MR CURRIN:  This morning, were you not approached by one of the applicants?</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a>MR MORUDU:  This morning I was approached by van Vuuren and I think his approach came after Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a>Currin asked me whether he came to me yesterday or the day before yesterday and asked for forgiveness, </p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a>so I don't take that that I should first hear it from somebody then he should come and ask for it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a>MR CURRIN:  If we could maybe facilitate some discussion, some real sort of heart to heart discussion </p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a>between you and the perpetrators to help you deal with the matters, do you think it may help you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a>MR MORUDU:  No, at this stage no, I don't think it will help me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a>MR CURRIN:  Are you working at the moment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a>MR MORUDU:  Yes, I am working.</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR CURRIN</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a>JUDGE MALL:  What work do you do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a>MR MORUDU:  I am working at this moment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a>JUDGE MALL:  What work are you doing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a>MR MORUDU:  I am a clerk.</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a>JUDGE MALL:  You are a clerk?</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a>MR MORUDU:  Yes.</p>

<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Did you have to undergo medical treatment for the injuries that you suffered?</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a>MR MORUDU:  Yes. I underwent medical - my last operation was last October 31st.</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Where?</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a>MR MORUDU:  Medforum Hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a>JUDGE MALL:  For what was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a>MR MORUDU:  According to that doctor they said my nose was -the bone which separates the two </p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a>nostrils was - went to the other side. I think it is as a result of them kicking me in my face.</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  Mr Morudu I think we need details, more details about what happened then at your </p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a>encounter with the applicants. I assume they came to you and picked you up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a>MR MORUDU:  Yes, they abducted me on the 17th May, it was around 7.00pm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  Ja, tell us about the abduction, start there, tell us what happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a>MR MORUDU:  I was in Mamelodi East at a certain comrade of mine reading newspapers and when I </p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a>went home it was dark.  It is an open veld. I noticed two Whites and two Blacks and they pulled out their </p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a>firearms and one of them shot and I was apprehended by one whom I realised as Hendrik Mokaba(?). And </p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a>from thereon my feet and my legs were chained and they drove me to the Security offices in Pretoria.</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  Did they tell you why they were taking you to Pretoria at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a>MR MORUDU:  No, they didn't tell me, they were sitting on top of me in fact inside in the kombi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  Did they identify themselves as the police or did they not?</p>

<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  Very well, then they drove with you to the Security offices in Pretoria?</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a>MR MORUDU:  That's correct, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a>MR MORUDU:  From there they just started assaulting me and they were extremely happy when they </p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a>were busy assaulting me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  How did they assault you? I know it's a long time back, you may not be able to give us </p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a>an account, blow to blow as to what they did, but to the extent that you are able to remember how you were </p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a>assaulted, can you tell us how you were assaulted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a>MR MORUDU:  I was assaulted with fists, with open hands, kicked and they used a baton also to assault </p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a>me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  All of them, did all of them take part in the assault?</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a>MR MORUDU:  All of them took part in the assault but the person who assaulted me seriously and who </p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a>kicked me in the face is van Vuuren.</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  Did you bleed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a>MR MORUDU:  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  Where?</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a>MR MORUDU:  From my nose.</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  Did you start bleeding on the way to offices already?</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a>MR MORUDU:  No, I started bleeding at their offices and my face was swollen, my hands, my feet and I </p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a>was denied medical attention.</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  Did you ask for it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a>MR MORUDU:  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  Now you are at the office and you are </p>

<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a>MR MORUDU:  After giving me that page to write down names of the members of my Executive they </p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a>took me to Central Police Station where they couldn't detain me there because those cops there said I must </p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a>first get medical attention before that.  Then from there they took me to Mamelodi Police Station where the </p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a>next day I was taken to Rust de Winter Police Station.</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  Rust de Winter?</p>

<p class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a>position in Mamelodi amongst the youth was in relation to his evidence.</p>

<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  Mr Morudu why were you elected as president? Why did the students think that you </p>
<p class="line" id="line585"><a name="pos585"></a>deserved the position of a president?</p>
<p class="line" id="line586"><a name="pos586"></a>MR MORUDU:  Maybe what I can think of at this stage is I was a prominent, I was an athlete at school, I </p>
<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a>was in a debating committee and they said how good I can debate when we have our debates.</p>
<p class="line" id="line588"><a name="pos588"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  Are there any other reasons that might have made you think that you might be a </p>

<p class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a>MR MORUDU:  I can't remember of any other thing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  Was it not because you had a political clout?</p>

<p class="line" id="line603"><a name="pos603"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Was nothing discussed pertaining to the upheavals in the township, the fact that the </p>

<p class="line" id="line606"><a name="pos606"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Nothing?</p>

<p class="line" id="line614"><a name="pos614"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  What issues were specifically discussed by you?</p>

<p class="line" id="line638"><a name="pos638"></a>MR MORUDU:  No, they were not discussed, but only school matters were discussed at that forum.</p>

<p class="line" id="line640"><a name="pos640"></a>MR MORUDU:  No.</p>

<p class="line" id="line655"><a name="pos655"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  So Mr Morudu, do I understand your evidence correct, you were simply not involved </p>
<p class="line" id="line656"><a name="pos656"></a>in politics at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line657"><a name="pos657"></a>MR MORUDU:  I don't know if you are going to put it as student politics or what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line658"><a name="pos658"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  No, I am talking of normal politics, not student politics, normal politics, ANC, UDF, </p>

<p class="line" id="line679"><a name="pos679"></a>MR MORUDU:  I don't know why they arrested me and I can only think that it was because of my student </p>
<p class="line" id="line680"><a name="pos680"></a>leadership position.</p>
<p class="line" id="line681"><a name="pos681"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Did they know you when they arrested you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line682"><a name="pos682"></a>MR MORUDU:  I don't know if they knew me at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line683"><a name="pos683"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Did you know Hendrik Bokaba?</p>
<p class="line" id="line684"><a name="pos684"></a>MR MORUDU:  I didn't know him, I knew him after my arrest.</p>
<p class="line" id="line685"><a name="pos685"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  When they arrested you did they call you on your name or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line686"><a name="pos686"></a>MR MORUDU:  No. They didn't call me on my name, they only fired a shot and the guy whom I was with </p>
<p class="line" id="line687"><a name="pos687"></a>ran away and I was accosted there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line688"><a name="pos688"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  So, they might have accosted anybody else there in Mamelodi on that day, is that </p>
<p class="line" id="line689"><a name="pos689"></a>what you are saying to us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line690"><a name="pos690"></a>MR MORUDU:  But according to what van Vuuren said yesterday, no.</p>

<p class="line" id="line692"><a name="pos692"></a>evidence now before this Committee for what reason on earth Mr Morudu would four security policemen </p>

<p class="line" id="line698"><a name="pos698"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Yes, Mr Chairman, he did answer it in that way....(tape ends) ...to arrest would you </p>
<p class="line" id="line699"><a name="pos699"></a>say arrest you because you were a student leader, why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line700"><a name="pos700"></a>MR MORUDU:  I can't think of a reason now why they wanted to arrest me because of my position.</p>
<p class="line" id="line701"><a name="pos701"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Because, Mr Morudu, you weren't involved in politics, so I have difficulty in </p>
<p class="line" id="line702"><a name="pos702"></a>understanding, even if you were a student leader if you were not involved in politics, why the security </p>
<p class="line" id="line703"><a name="pos703"></a>police would have been interested in you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line704"><a name="pos704"></a>MR MORUDU:  As I have already said, I can't know, maybe they got some information somewhere about </p>
<p class="line" id="line705"><a name="pos705"></a>me, so I can't know their reasons for it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line706"><a name="pos706"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Yes, Mr Morudu, you heard the information which they have given and the evidence </p>
<p class="line" id="line707"><a name="pos707"></a>which they have given before this Committee in respect of your involvement in student activities, school </p>
<p class="line" id="line708"><a name="pos708"></a>boycotts and I can read from the application itself, "your involvement with petrol bombs, intimidation and </p>

<p class="line" id="line710"><a name="pos710"></a>MR MORUDU:  They could have heard that about the petrol bombings, but I was never involved in any </p>

<p class="line" id="line745"><a name="pos745"></a>MR MORUDU:  I don't understand when you say "politics" it is maybe when we attending and we talk </p>
<p class="line" id="line746"><a name="pos746"></a>about our stationery and so forth, will that be classified as "politics" or not.</p>

<p class="line" id="line766"><a name="pos766"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  So you were aware and you could differentiate about politics information and you </p>
<p class="line" id="line767"><a name="pos767"></a>decided not to give it to them?</p>

<p class="line" id="line772"><a name="pos772"></a>MR MORUDU:  Like the meetings other than student meetings which were to happen or to be held.</p>
<p class="line" id="line773"><a name="pos773"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  What meetings were those?</p>
<p class="line" id="line774"><a name="pos774"></a>MR MORUDU:  Of maybe like the Civic and so forth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line775"><a name="pos775"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Sorry?</p>

<p class="line" id="line777"><a name="pos777"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  But why didn't you want to give information about the Civic Organisations to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line778"><a name="pos778"></a>security police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line779"><a name="pos779"></a>MR MORUDU:  No, it was against my conscience.</p>
<p class="line" id="line780"><a name="pos780"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line781"><a name="pos781"></a>MR MORUDU:  It was against my conscience, I couldn't just give them that and as I have already stated I </p>
<p class="line" id="line782"><a name="pos782"></a>didn't willingfully work with them, I was forced.</p>
<p class="line" id="line783"><a name="pos783"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Yes, but what I want to know is, the kind of information that you did not want to give </p>
<p class="line" id="line784"><a name="pos784"></a>to the security police, you say it is meetings of the Civic Organisations. Why didn't you want to give </p>
<p class="line" id="line785"><a name="pos785"></a>information about those meetings to the security police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line786"><a name="pos786"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  He says it was against his conscience because after all he was not willingly, he was </p>
<p class="line" id="line787"><a name="pos787"></a>not willing, he was </p>

<p class="line" id="line791"><a name="pos791"></a>ADV. DU PLESSIS:  Yes, Mr Chairman. Why was it against your conscience then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line792"><a name="pos792"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  Because he was - he did not volunteer to cooperate with the police he was forced, that </p>
<p class="line" id="line793"><a name="pos793"></a>is what he is saying. Is there any other reason other than you were forced to work with the police as to why </p>
<p class="line" id="line794"><a name="pos794"></a>you did not give them information?</p>
<p class="line" id="line795"><a name="pos795"></a>MR MORUDU:  It was just I hated them at that time and especially of the bombing of my home when my </p>
<p class="line" id="line796"><a name="pos796"></a>niece was killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line797"><a name="pos797"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  We don't always get the answer we want by hammering the same question time and </p>
<p class="line" id="line798"><a name="pos798"></a>again Mr du Plessis. JUDGE WILSON:  When was the bombing of your home, before or after they </p>
<p class="line" id="line799"><a name="pos799"></a>arrested and assaulted you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line800"><a name="pos800"></a>MR MORUDU:   Three months before they arrested me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line801"><a name="pos801"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Now, Mr Chairman, may I go ahead?</p>
<p class="line" id="line802"><a name="pos802"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Yes Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line803"><a name="pos803"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Thank you.	Mr Morudu, you say you were paid sometimes and you were </p>
<p class="line" id="line804"><a name="pos804"></a>sometimes not paid?</p>
<p class="line" id="line805"><a name="pos805"></a>MR MORUDU:  Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line806"><a name="pos806"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Do you know why you were paid sometimes and not paid other times?</p>
<p class="line" id="line807"><a name="pos807"></a>MR MORUDU:   No, I didn't ask questions, they were very ruthless, even at that time, they would always </p>
<p class="line" id="line808"><a name="pos808"></a>swear at you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line809"><a name="pos809"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Now, I am going to put it to you, Mr Morudu, that the reason why you were paid </p>
<p class="line" id="line810"><a name="pos810"></a>sometimes and sometimes not was that the security police only paid informers when they gave important </p>
<p class="line" id="line811"><a name="pos811"></a>information to them. What do you say about that? Can you dispute that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line812"><a name="pos812"></a>MR MORUDU:  I don't have comment on that one.</p>

<p class="line" id="line818"><a name="pos818"></a>information or did you give them false information?</p>
<p class="line" id="line819"><a name="pos819"></a>MR MORUDU:  At times I gave them correct information and at times I gave them information which </p>
<p class="line" id="line820"><a name="pos820"></a>came from Mamasela which he gave me and I wrote it with my handwriting and gave it to them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line821"><a name="pos821"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  This information that you gave to them, did it have anything to do with politics at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line822"><a name="pos822"></a>MR MORUDU:  Yes, the one which Mamasela gave me, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line823"><a name="pos823"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  You mean the information that you gave to Mamasela?</p>
<p class="line" id="line824"><a name="pos824"></a>MR MORUDU:  Which he gave to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line825"><a name="pos825"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Which he gave to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line826"><a name="pos826"></a>MR MORUDU:  He gave to me to give to the White cops.</p>

<p class="line" id="line829"><a name="pos829"></a>MR MORUDU:  I can't remember so well, but I was giving them  information which I knew they can get </p>
<p class="line" id="line830"><a name="pos830"></a>from anywhere.</p>
<p class="line" id="line831"><a name="pos831"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Even if you gave them such information they came back for more, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line832"><a name="pos832"></a>MR MORUDU:  Well, when they came back for more they were always swearing at me and trying to get </p>
<p class="line" id="line833"><a name="pos833"></a>more.</p>
<p class="line" id="line834"><a name="pos834"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  And they paid you for information that they could get anywhere else. Is that right?</p>

<p class="line" id="line845"><a name="pos845"></a>MR MORUDU:  At times they found out that is why they were keeping on threatening me saying that I am </p>
<p class="line" id="line846"><a name="pos846"></a>useless to them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line847"><a name="pos847"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  But did they come back to you for information again?</p>

<p class="line" id="line869"><a name="pos869"></a>Congress, because I feel that they will get it from somebody and as they threatened to kill me, they would </p>
<p class="line" id="line870"><a name="pos870"></a>eliminate me if I don't give them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line871"><a name="pos871"></a>MS KHAMPEPE:  Mr Morudu, did you not as members of the Mamelodi Students Congress put blame </p>

<p class="line" id="line877"><a name="pos877"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  If we go through the registers, the police registers of that police station we will find </p>
<p class="line" id="line878"><a name="pos878"></a>your name, probably there, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line879"><a name="pos879"></a>MR MORUDU:  I don't know whether they just put me in there or not, I don't know their procedure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line880"><a name="pos880"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Right, because I put it to you that - because it wasn't put to Warrant Officer van </p>
<p class="line" id="line881"><a name="pos881"></a>Vuuren he couldn't testify about that but I will request the Committee for him to testify about that now, I </p>
<p class="line" id="line882"><a name="pos882"></a>put it to you that Warrant Officer van Vuuren will testify that you were not kept for two months at the Rust </p>
<p class="line" id="line883"><a name="pos883"></a>de Winter police station and that you are lying.</p>

<p class="line" id="line892"><a name="pos892"></a>Station.</p>
<p class="line" id="line893"><a name="pos893"></a>MR MORUDU:  On that one I can't say that he is correct, but I was at Rust de Winter, because I was </p>

<p class="line" id="line920"><a name="pos920"></a>MR CURRIN:  Okay, thank you.</p>

<p class="line" id="line924"><a name="pos924"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  We were not told a word by the applicant about him being detained, were we?  I have </p>
<p class="line" id="line925"><a name="pos925"></a>been looking at my notes, the evidence given by Mr van Vuuren he merely said after the assault he became </p>
<p class="line" id="line926"><a name="pos926"></a>an informant, not that we had to keep him locked up for a week?</p>
<p class="line" id="line927"><a name="pos927"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Yes, Mr Chairman, the evidence was presented in terms of the application on that </p>
<p class="line" id="line928"><a name="pos928"></a>basis, now what I would want to say to the Committee is that I raised this point, I did not deem that </p>
<p class="line" id="line929"><a name="pos929"></a>evidence to be of a crucial nature pertaining to the application.  Obviously if these aspects were put to my </p>
<p class="line" id="line930"><a name="pos930"></a>clients when they testified that Mr Morudu was going to come and testify they would have volunteered to </p>
<p class="line" id="line931"><a name="pos931"></a>have given that evidence. If the Committee should deem that information as important then, then I would </p>
<p class="line" id="line932"><a name="pos932"></a>want to ask that Warrant Officer van Vuuren then be called as a witness so that he can testify about that </p>

<p class="line" id="line957"><a name="pos957"></a>ADV MPSHE:  Mr Chairman it would seem Mr Visser would like to say something first before we </p>
<p class="line" id="line958"><a name="pos958"></a>proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line959"><a name="pos959"></a>MR VISSER:  Well Mr Chairman not really, I was just wondering whether from a practical point of view, </p>
<p class="line" id="line960"><a name="pos960"></a>you shouldn't be informed when you go onto a new incident, </p>
<p class="line" id="line961"><a name="pos961"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line962"><a name="pos962"></a>ADV VISSER	198	ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line963"><a name="pos963"></a>whether there had been Section 19(4) notices in that incident, because in the present case I would submit </p>
<p class="line" id="line964"><a name="pos964"></a>that one can conveniently deal with the 19(4) notice, in this case it was directed to Brigadier Schoon, but I </p>
<p class="line" id="line965"><a name="pos965"></a>am in your hands. I am going to sit and listen to the evidence anyway, but I just thought it might be </p>
<p class="line" id="line966"><a name="pos966"></a>convenient for you to know beforehand what Brigadier Schoon is going to say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line967"><a name="pos967"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Mr Mpshe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line968"><a name="pos968"></a>ADV MPSHE:  Mr Chairman I don't know how to respond to that one because if 19(4)'s have been served </p>
<p class="line" id="line969"><a name="pos969"></a>and the legal representative is here, it is for him to indicate that we are here in these matters. Brigadier </p>
<p class="line" id="line970"><a name="pos970"></a>Schoon has been served with a 19(4) as well as the other members who are implicated in this matter. I don't </p>
<p class="line" id="line971"><a name="pos971"></a>know whether I should announce who all are being served in a particular matter, because the lawyers do </p>
<p class="line" id="line972"><a name="pos972"></a>come in the morning and they meet the Committee, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line973"><a name="pos973"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Well now, for present purposes in the Zwele matter...</p>
<p class="line" id="line974"><a name="pos974"></a>ADV MPSHE:  I will have to check my returns of service Mr Chairman then if the Chairman will give me </p>
<p class="line" id="line975"><a name="pos975"></a>time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line976"><a name="pos976"></a>JUDGE MALL:  No, are the parties adequately represented now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line977"><a name="pos977"></a>ADV MPSHE:  Parties, Mr Chairperson is that ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line978"><a name="pos978"></a>JUDGE MALL:  The interested parties, those implicated or likely to be implicated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line979"><a name="pos979"></a>ADV MPSHE:  Yes, Mr Chairperson, Advocate Visser is representing some of those who are implicated in </p>
<p class="line" id="line980"><a name="pos980"></a>this matter Mr Chairman.  If the Chairman could just give me a chance to go through my returns of service, </p>
<p class="line" id="line981"><a name="pos981"></a>then I will tell who is there, but for what I know, Mr Schoon is a client of </p>
<p class="line" id="line982"><a name="pos982"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line983"><a name="pos983"></a>199</p>
<p class="line" id="line984"><a name="pos984"></a>attorney Wagenaar and Adv. Visser is here for  Wagenaar and Schoon has been served.</p>
<p class="line" id="line985"><a name="pos985"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line986"><a name="pos986"></a>ADV VISSER:  That is correct Mr Chairman, that is correct, I think that's really the point.  May I just say, </p>
<p class="line" id="line987"><a name="pos987"></a>while my learned friend is scrambling his papers, we have prepared a short affidavit, it deals with three </p>
<p class="line" id="line988"><a name="pos988"></a>incidents in which Brig. Schoon is implicated - the first one being the Zweli Nyanda and Keith McFadden </p>
<p class="line" id="line989"><a name="pos989"></a>matter, I wonder whether I couldn't hand up to you Mr Chairman, the affidavit, the original is on top </p>
<p class="line" id="line990"><a name="pos990"></a>thereof and there are copies for the other members of the Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line991"><a name="pos991"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Yes, please do hand them in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line992"><a name="pos992"></a>ADV VISSER:  Perhaps I could just, so that there are no secrets, perhaps I could just inform you what the </p>
<p class="line" id="line993"><a name="pos993"></a>situation is in regard to the first matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line994"><a name="pos994"></a>	You will notice the top one was the original Mr Chairman, you will notice Mr Chairman in </p>
<p class="line" id="line995"><a name="pos995"></a>paragraph 2.1 that Brig. Schoon refers to application for amnesty by J Cronje and four others and then over </p>
<p class="line" id="line996"><a name="pos996"></a>the page he lists the incidents in paragraph 2.2 in which he is implicated by way of the 19(4) notices and </p>
<p class="line" id="line997"><a name="pos997"></a>then pertinent to this particular matter which you are about to deal with now, he deals with in paragraph 3 </p>
<p class="line" id="line998"><a name="pos998"></a>and perhaps I should read it into the record Mr Chairman then it is there, unless you have other directions </p>
<p class="line" id="line999"><a name="pos999"></a>in this regard, perhaps you just wish to read it yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1000"><a name="pos1000"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Will you just read that into the record?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1001"><a name="pos1001"></a>ADV VISSER:  Yes, if I may, Mr Chairman. Paragraph 3.1 he says,</p>
<p class="line" id="line1002"><a name="pos1002"></a>		"In December 1996 an amnesty application was</p>
<p class="line" id="line1003"><a name="pos1003"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>

<p class="line" id="line1005"><a name="pos1005"></a>		launched for me before the Amnesty Committee where inter alia I deal with this relevant </p>
<p class="line" id="line1006"><a name="pos1006"></a>incident.  I confirm the correctness of my own role in this as described in the application </p>
<p class="line" id="line1007"><a name="pos1007"></a>of Jack Cronje ...."</p>
<p class="line" id="line1008"><a name="pos1008"></a>obviously referring to the written application Mr Chairman,</p>
<p class="line" id="line1009"><a name="pos1009"></a>		"... but I do not have any personal knowledge of how the operation was executed. As a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1010"><a name="pos1010"></a>result I cannot be of much assistance to the Amnesty Committee in this regard and for </p>
<p class="line" id="line1011"><a name="pos1011"></a>that reason my amnesty application on Page 58 does not contain much information". </p>
<p class="line" id="line1012"><a name="pos1012"></a>So it is really a question of no contest at this time as matters stand on the papers, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1013"><a name="pos1013"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  Mr Visser, could I just get clarity on that, we know that these men have been murdered. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1014"><a name="pos1014"></a>Brig. Cronje says he received instruction from Brig. Schoon and Gen. van Rensburg, I don't know if you </p>
<p class="line" id="line1015"><a name="pos1015"></a>are representing Gen. Steenkamp I am sorry not Van Rensburg - to go and find out where Nyanda resided </p>
<p class="line" id="line1016"><a name="pos1016"></a>and then to eliminate him. Was that an instruction to go and kill him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1017"><a name="pos1017"></a>ADV VISSER:  Mr Chairman as I understand it, yes, and Brig. Schoon confirms it as being correct but I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1018"><a name="pos1018"></a>am not representing Steenkamp.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1019"><a name="pos1019"></a>ADV DE JAGER:   We just want some clarity on the word "eliminate" because it gets used quite often and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1020"><a name="pos1020"></a>sometimes I get the impression that not everyone is ad idem as to what it means. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1021"><a name="pos1021"></a>ADV VISSER:  I would be surprised if he said "eliminated" meant anything other than what we know it to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1022"><a name="pos1022"></a>mean.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1023"><a name="pos1023"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Yes.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1039"><a name="pos1039"></a>EXAMINATION BY ADV DU PLESSIS:  Brigadier Cronje, this incident took place approximately </p>
<p class="line" id="line1040"><a name="pos1040"></a>February 1983. Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1041"><a name="pos1041"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  Yes, that is correct.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1044"><a name="pos1044"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  What was your rank at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1045"><a name="pos1045"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  I was a full Colonel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1046"><a name="pos1046"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Very well.  If you look at Page 53 of your application, could you explain to the </p>

<p class="line" id="line1048"><a name="pos1048"></a>happened in this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1049"><a name="pos1049"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  Zwele Nyanda was a prominent member of the ANC.  He was the head of the ANC's </p>
<p class="line" id="line1050"><a name="pos1050"></a>operations in Natal, at Natal Machinery.  The Security Branch knew that he resided </p>

<p class="line" id="line1054"><a name="pos1054"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Could I just stop you there please, Brigadier, we have just received a request from the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1055"><a name="pos1055"></a>interpreters that when you read off your documents you please do it a bit slowly because they cannot keep </p>
<p class="line" id="line1056"><a name="pos1056"></a>up with you, so if you could please just read out a bit slower.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1057"><a name="pos1057"></a>	After several acts of terrorism where civilians had been killed had been planned by him, what </p>
<p class="line" id="line1058"><a name="pos1058"></a>kind of acts were those?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1059"><a name="pos1059"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  These were bomb explosions as far as I know inter alia?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1060"><a name="pos1060"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Were there any limpet mine explosions in which he was involved?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1061"><a name="pos1061"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  I am not sure, but it is possible that there was a limpet mine explosion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1062"><a name="pos1062"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Brigadier could you explain to the Committee how the instruction came about and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1063"><a name="pos1063"></a>where it came from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1064"><a name="pos1064"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  Brigadier Schoon, who was my direct commanding officer at Vlakplaas at the time, gave </p>
<p class="line" id="line1065"><a name="pos1065"></a>me such an instruction and also General Steenkamp who at that stage was the head of the Security Branch </p>
<p class="line" id="line1066"><a name="pos1066"></a>in the Republic.  The instruction was to go to Swaziland, establish where Nyanda resided, where he </p>
<p class="line" id="line1067"><a name="pos1067"></a>operated from and then to eliminate him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1068"><a name="pos1068"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:   Could we proceed with the third paragraph.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1069"><a name="pos1069"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  The information was obtained from an informant. I would just like to correct - it was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1070"><a name="pos1070"></a>dealt with by the Piet Retief branch that Nyanda was residing in a house outside of Manzini. The informant </p>
<p class="line" id="line1071"><a name="pos1071"></a>provided us with the address. Captain Eugene de Kok, Warrant Officer Van Dyk, Constable Almond </p>

<p class="line" id="line1075"><a name="pos1075"></a>and I went to Vlakplaas from the Oshoek Border Post. At the Oshoek Border Post, a warrant officer from </p>
<p class="line" id="line1076"><a name="pos1076"></a>Piet Retief and a Warrant Officer Rohrig from Witbank proceeded with us to a hotel between Mbabane and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1077"><a name="pos1077"></a>Manzini. At approximately 1.00am that morning we went to Manzini and we initially attacked the house </p>
<p class="line" id="line1078"><a name="pos1078"></a>with stun grenades. All of us were involved.  When we launched our attack lights were switched on inside </p>
<p class="line" id="line1079"><a name="pos1079"></a>the house and I could see Nyanda moving, running from one room in the house to another and also running </p>
<p class="line" id="line1080"><a name="pos1080"></a>down the passage. Someone shot him in his legs from outside, I cannot remember exactly who that was.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1081"><a name="pos1081"></a>Thereafter he went into the bathroom where he locked the door. Someone else who was in the house, in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1082"><a name="pos1082"></a>bedroom, at that stage, jumped out of the window and ran away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1083"><a name="pos1083"></a>	Almond Nofomela shot at the man and injured Geoff Besigu(?) in his ankle in the process. I shot </p>
<p class="line" id="line1084"><a name="pos1084"></a>the door of the house open and when I kicked the door open there was a man in the kitchen who had just </p>
<p class="line" id="line1085"><a name="pos1085"></a>come from the passage into the kitchen, he was wrapped in a blanket, he jumped up and ran down the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1086"><a name="pos1086"></a>passage. Immediately I went after him and I kicked open the door of the bedroom he had fled into, the light </p>
<p class="line" id="line1087"><a name="pos1087"></a>was on and I started shooting at the man. I killed him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1088"><a name="pos1088"></a>	There was a woman hiding in the wardrobe, we left her there and did not injure her. Thereafter I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1089"><a name="pos1089"></a>went out through the kitchen door again and I saw Nyanda trying to jump out of the bathroom window.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1090"><a name="pos1090"></a>Eugene de Kok shot him with an AK47, he fell, got up and ran away. De Kok shot him in his back </p>
<p class="line" id="line1091"><a name="pos1091"></a>whereafter he remained lying there. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1092"><a name="pos1092"></a>	We quickly searched the house and found documents containing plans to attack defence force </p>

<p class="line" id="line1097"><a name="pos1097"></a>and we could not hang around there for too long, so the house was not searched thoroughly. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1098"><a name="pos1098"></a>	After the operation we went back to Oshoek and crossed the border near the border post back into </p>
<p class="line" id="line1099"><a name="pos1099"></a>the Republic. Thereafter I contacted Brigadier Schoon and informed him that we had killed two persons. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1100"><a name="pos1100"></a>	The following morning De Kok and I drove to Pretoria where I handed the documents which we </p>
<p class="line" id="line1101"><a name="pos1101"></a>had seized to General Steenkamp. Before I left I had arranged that Geoff Besigu be treated in the Ermelo </p>
<p class="line" id="line1102"><a name="pos1102"></a>Hospital. Thereafter I was merited with an award for outstanding service and also De Kok, Van Dyk, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1103"><a name="pos1103"></a>Pienaar and Rohrig. Geoff Besigu and Nofamela were both promoted to the ranks of sergeant as well as Joe </p>
<p class="line" id="line1104"><a name="pos1104"></a>Mamasela. 	Mamasela played a big role in the preliminary investigation into Nyanda but he was not </p>
<p class="line" id="line1105"><a name="pos1105"></a>there that night and for this reason he was also promoted. The medals which were awarded to me were </p>
<p class="line" id="line1106"><a name="pos1106"></a>handed over by the ex-Minister of police,  Louis LeGrange. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1107"><a name="pos1107"></a>	When I entered the room where McFadden, the man whom I had shot, and I hadn't known at that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1108"><a name="pos1108"></a>stage, I had no choice but to shoot at him. I did not know whether he was armed or not and whether he </p>
<p class="line" id="line1109"><a name="pos1109"></a>would have shot me or not. The normal reaction in such a case is to shoot. We expected that everyone </p>
<p class="line" id="line1110"><a name="pos1110"></a>should have been armed, everyone inside the house, and where such an attack was launched, there was no </p>
<p class="line" id="line1111"><a name="pos1111"></a>time to ask the person whether or not they were armed first. I assumed that he was a member of the ANC - </p>
<p class="line" id="line1112"><a name="pos1112"></a>that he assisted Nyanda and that he would probably have been armed. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1113"><a name="pos1113"></a>	This operation has to be seen in the light of the </p>

<p class="line" id="line1117"><a name="pos1117"></a>other. There were many acts of terrorism at that time in Natal which increased from month to month.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1118"><a name="pos1118"></a>Many of the attacks came from Swaziland and were planned by Nyanda.   Nyanda, as far as I can </p>
<p class="line" id="line1119"><a name="pos1119"></a>remember, was responsible for the death of several civilians in Natal at that stage, through his planning of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1120"><a name="pos1120"></a>acts of terrorism. It was done in agreement with the government's revolutionary strategy to suppress the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1121"><a name="pos1121"></a>liberation movements and to prevent the Republic of South Africa from being destabilised any further.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1122"><a name="pos1122"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Very well, Brigadier. When you saw McFadden could you see whether he was armed </p>
<p class="line" id="line1123"><a name="pos1123"></a>or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1124"><a name="pos1124"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  As I said he was wrapped in a blanket and I could not see what was in his hands under </p>
<p class="line" id="line1125"><a name="pos1125"></a>the blanket.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1126"><a name="pos1126"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Did you foresee that he could have been armed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1127"><a name="pos1127"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  I expected that he would have been armed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1128"><a name="pos1128"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Was there any time for you to determine whether he was armed and if he was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1129"><a name="pos1129"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  No, not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1130"><a name="pos1130"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Do you know today whether he was armed or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1131"><a name="pos1131"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  I do not know if he was armed, as I said, there were weapons found in the house, but </p>
<p class="line" id="line1132"><a name="pos1132"></a>there was no time to search the property.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1133"><a name="pos1133"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Was there a woman in the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1134"><a name="pos1134"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  Yes, there was a woman there, but it was our policy, so that where possible we did not </p>
<p class="line" id="line1135"><a name="pos1135"></a>wage war against women and children, or at least I should say innocent women and children.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1138"><a name="pos1138"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  Brigadier, you used the word "innocent" there, she was an innocent woman was she, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1139"><a name="pos1139"></a>although she was in the same house and the same room as McFadden?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1140"><a name="pos1140"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  I didn't know her at all, Mr Chairman and I had to assume that she was innocent at the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1141"><a name="pos1141"></a>time because I had never heard of her before.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1142"><a name="pos1142"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Where was she Brigadier?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1143"><a name="pos1143"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  She was hiding in a wardrobe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1144"><a name="pos1144"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Did you know about McFadden before the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1145"><a name="pos1145"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  We did not know about McFadden.  We knew that there was another man with the name </p>
<p class="line" id="line1146"><a name="pos1146"></a>by "Cecil" who we knew was a trained terrorist, was also in the house, but Cecil is the one who jumped out </p>
<p class="line" id="line1147"><a name="pos1147"></a>of the window.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1148"><a name="pos1148"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Did you expect when you entered the house that there should be more than one </p>
<p class="line" id="line1149"><a name="pos1149"></a>armed man in the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1150"><a name="pos1150"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  I knew that there would be at least two.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1151"><a name="pos1151"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  You expected there to have been at least two?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1152"><a name="pos1152"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1153"><a name="pos1153"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  At the stage you shot at McFadden how many men did you see in the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1154"><a name="pos1154"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  There were only two. I would just like to mention that I, myself did not see Cecil </p>
<p class="line" id="line1155"><a name="pos1155"></a>jumping out of the window because at that time I was at the kitchen door.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1156"><a name="pos1156"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  When you shot at McFadden you were aware of two males and the woman, where </p>

<p class="line" id="line1163"><a name="pos1163"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  When you shot at McFadden, did you think that he was the other male whom you had </p>
<p class="line" id="line1164"><a name="pos1164"></a>information about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1165"><a name="pos1165"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  Yes, I was under that impression.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1166"><a name="pos1166"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Now, Brigadier could we go to Page 58 where reference is made to the political </p>
<p class="line" id="line1167"><a name="pos1167"></a>objective and the general justification which we have had from all the applicants is contained in this, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1168"><a name="pos1168"></a>namely intimidation and protection of information and combatting acts of terrorism. Do you confirm the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1169"><a name="pos1169"></a>information from page 58 to page 62?  That is the justification.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1170"><a name="pos1170"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  Yes, I confirm it as such.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1171"><a name="pos1171"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Could you go to page 63 or rather page 62. Could you just read from the bottom </p>
<p class="line" id="line1172"><a name="pos1172"></a>paragraph to the Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1173"><a name="pos1173"></a>BRIG CRONJE:	"All the above lead to the fact that the National Party remained in power and that </p>

<p class="line" id="line1204"><a name="pos1204"></a>have been served except General Steenkamp and Geoffrey Besigu.  And why they were not served is I did </p>
<p class="line" id="line1205"><a name="pos1205"></a>not have the particulars where to contact them. I </p>

<p class="line" id="line1208"><a name="pos1208"></a>have just perused the document that was given to this Committee on Monday by Advocate Visser. I have </p>
<p class="line" id="line1209"><a name="pos1209"></a>noted there is a Steenkamp on their list but I don't know whether it is this Steenkamp mentioned herein Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line1210"><a name="pos1210"></a>Chairman,  but all parties have been served and I have got returns of service. Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1211"><a name="pos1211"></a>ADV VISSER:  Mr Chairman I don't have the answer to that. I wasn't informed that the Steenkamp that is </p>
<p class="line" id="line1212"><a name="pos1212"></a>implicated here is one of my clients, but I am not saying that he isn't.  We are in early days still and we are </p>
<p class="line" id="line1213"><a name="pos1213"></a>trying to sort out precisely what - who our clients are and what the situation is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1214"><a name="pos1214"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Do you know whether you are representing General Steenkamp at this stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1215"><a name="pos1215"></a>ADV VISSER:  I am not sure whether this is the Steenkamp which is my client, certainly that doesn't </p>
<p class="line" id="line1216"><a name="pos1216"></a>accord with my information at the moment.  But may I say that I am going to ask a few questions and the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1217"><a name="pos1217"></a>questions will relate to both Schoon and to anybody else that may have given an order so I don't foresee </p>
<p class="line" id="line1218"><a name="pos1218"></a>with respect that any undue time would be wasted even if it is not my client.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1222"><a name="pos1222"></a>here today or earlier in the week and they don't seem to be here, however, I just would like to place on </p>
<p class="line" id="line1223"><a name="pos1223"></a>record that their instructions are to place on record that they are in favour of the amnesty process and that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1224"><a name="pos1224"></a>they are in favour of reconciliation subject to full disclosure, and that is an area which they have instructed </p>

<p class="line" id="line1228"><a name="pos1228"></a>them as a family since he was a resident in the house at the time and the attack wasn't aimed at him.  I just </p>
<p class="line" id="line1229"><a name="pos1229"></a>put on record what the objective of my cross-examination objectives will be.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1230"><a name="pos1230"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1231"><a name="pos1231"></a>CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR CURRIN:  In your evidence Brigadier, you mentioned that you got </p>
<p class="line" id="line1232"><a name="pos1232"></a>information from an informer and in your written document you stated that it was an informer in Piet Retief </p>
<p class="line" id="line1233"><a name="pos1233"></a>and then you changed that in your evidence-in- chief. Please repeat that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1234"><a name="pos1234"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  I changed it because it was not an informant who lived in Piet Retief, Mr Chairman, but </p>
<p class="line" id="line1235"><a name="pos1235"></a>it was an informant who was dealt with by Warrant Officer Pienaar in Piet Retief and that is why he was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1236"><a name="pos1236"></a>also involved in the operation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1237"><a name="pos1237"></a>MR CURRIN:  His family, for no other reason other than full disclosure would like to know who the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1238"><a name="pos1238"></a>informer was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1239"><a name="pos1239"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  Mr Chairperson, I don't know who the informant was. I think Warrant Officer Pienaar </p>
<p class="line" id="line1240"><a name="pos1240"></a>would possibly be able to answer that question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1241"><a name="pos1241"></a>MR CURRIN:  Could I ask you to take steps to try and obtain that information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1242"><a name="pos1242"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  I can do it, I undertake to do it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1243"><a name="pos1243"></a>MR CURRIN:   Because it is important for the family in the context of reconciliation to have all the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1244"><a name="pos1244"></a>information which they feel they need to deal with the process within themselves.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1245"><a name="pos1245"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  I understand that.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1252"><a name="pos1252"></a>question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1253"><a name="pos1253"></a>BRIG CRONJE:   Please.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1255"><a name="pos1255"></a>you attacked to find out who was in the house, how many people were in the house, yet in your evidence-</p>
<p class="line" id="line1256"><a name="pos1256"></a>in-chief you indicated that you had information that there was more than one male in the house, where did </p>

<p class="line" id="line1258"><a name="pos1258"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  This information came from the same informant. We knew that Nyanda and Cecil </p>
<p class="line" id="line1259"><a name="pos1259"></a>worked together and when we entered the house and I saw McFadden, when I entered the house and saw </p>
<p class="line" id="line1260"><a name="pos1260"></a>McFadden I was under the impression that it could be Cecil.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1261"><a name="pos1261"></a>MR CURRIN:  Tell us about Cecil?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1262"><a name="pos1262"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  It was him who jumped out of the window and got away. I heard afterwards that it was a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1263"><a name="pos1263"></a>man who worked with Nyanda. I can't remember his surname.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1264"><a name="pos1264"></a>MR CURRIN:   Was he a South African or a Swazi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1265"><a name="pos1265"></a>BRIG CRONJE:   No. He was a South African.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1266"><a name="pos1266"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  Did he live in that house?  Was your information that he lived in the same house as </p>

<p class="line" id="line1268"><a name="pos1268"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  No, he worked together and he lived together in the house with Nyanda, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1269"><a name="pos1269"></a>MR CURRIN:  But in your evidence-in-chief, you said you didn't know who this person was that you were </p>

<p class="line" id="line1275"><a name="pos1275"></a>MR CURRIN:  Why didn't you say that in your evidence-in- chief?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1276"><a name="pos1276"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Mr Chairman he did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1277"><a name="pos1277"></a>MR CURRIN:    Sorry, I must have misunderstood you. Okay, my apologies.  Why did you assume that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1278"><a name="pos1278"></a>this other person, who was a male was a guilty person, but yet another person in the house who happened </p>
<p class="line" id="line1279"><a name="pos1279"></a>to be a female was innocent, I would just like to know the basis of those assumptions?  And that the male </p>
<p class="line" id="line1280"><a name="pos1280"></a>could be armed, but the female couldn't be armed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1281"><a name="pos1281"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Is it because he had information that there were two people in the house, two men, who </p>
<p class="line" id="line1282"><a name="pos1282"></a>were possibly the targets?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1283"><a name="pos1283"></a>MR CURRIN:  Possibly. Is that the answer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1284"><a name="pos1284"></a>BRIG CRONJE:   Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1285"><a name="pos1285"></a>MR CURRIN:    Thank you Mr Chairman.  Have you found out subsequently who Keith McFadden was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1286"><a name="pos1286"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  I later heard that he was also a member of the ANC who worked with Nyanda.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1288"><a name="pos1288"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Mr Chairperson, excuse me, before Mr Visser starts cross-examining the witness, I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1289"><a name="pos1289"></a>would like to make one point.  I have read the Act, Mr Chairman, and the Act as we all know is a little bit </p>
<p class="line" id="line1290"><a name="pos1290"></a>ambiguous, I do not have any problem with Mr Visser questioning my clients.  What I, however, can </p>
<p class="line" id="line1291"><a name="pos1291"></a>foresee is that in an incident where there are perhaps five or ten, maybe, persons implicated all represented </p>
<p class="line" id="line1292"><a name="pos1292"></a>by lawyers that the applicants will then be cross-examined by a representative of each of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1293"><a name="pos1293"></a>JUDGE MALL:  What about dealing with the problem as it arises.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1294"><a name="pos1294"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line1295"><a name="pos1295"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	209	ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line1296"><a name="pos1296"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Well, Mr Chairman, with respect, the problem in principle is here now, the question </p>
<p class="line" id="line1297"><a name="pos1297"></a>is if a person who is implicated and is represented at the hearings is entitled to subject the applicants to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1298"><a name="pos1298"></a>cross-examination, I want to repeat we do not want to object to that, I am not objecting to that, all I am </p>
<p class="line" id="line1299"><a name="pos1299"></a>asking is, I am asking a ruling of the Committee pertaining to this, Mr Chairman. I read Section 30 as </p>
<p class="line" id="line1300"><a name="pos1300"></a>referring to a person that he should be afforded an opportunity to submit representations to the Commission </p>
<p class="line" id="line1301"><a name="pos1301"></a>within a specified time with regard to the matter under consideration or to give evidence at a hearing of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1302"><a name="pos1302"></a>Commission.  Now the fact that there is reference to giving evidence at a hearing of the Commission might </p>
<p class="line" id="line1303"><a name="pos1303"></a>also include the right to cross-examination. I just cannot let this go by without raising the point because of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1304"><a name="pos1304"></a>the fact that the Act is not clear on this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1305"><a name="pos1305"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  The Act doesn't implicity authorise you to cross-examine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1306"><a name="pos1306"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Well, that is true, Mr Chairman, that is ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1307"><a name="pos1307"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  There is no explicit authorisation in the Act anywhere, it only states that we could limit </p>
<p class="line" id="line1308"><a name="pos1308"></a>you in cross-examination.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1309"><a name="pos1309"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Yes, the Act also does not state specifically that Mr Currin has a right to cross-</p>
<p class="line" id="line1310"><a name="pos1310"></a>examination.  Now as I can recall this issue was dealt with in October when Mr Currin appeared and the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1311"><a name="pos1311"></a>ruling was made in that regard and I accept that ruling. I am simply making this point because this is a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1312"><a name="pos1312"></a>different situation than a representative representing the victims. It is a legal representative representing </p>
<p class="line" id="line1313"><a name="pos1313"></a>somebody who has been implicated PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line1314"><a name="pos1314"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	210	ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line1315"><a name="pos1315"></a>and I am just asking the Committee to make a ruling in this regard.  I am not trying to be obstructive.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1316"><a name="pos1316"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  Mr Du Plessis, I have no doubt the Committee will make your ruling but speaking for </p>
<p class="line" id="line1317"><a name="pos1317"></a>myself, I really don't see any difficulty about that, I can hardly imagine - take an extreme case, take a case </p>
<p class="line" id="line1318"><a name="pos1318"></a>where a person is according to him, wrongly and falsely implicated and maybe he wasn't even there on that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1319"><a name="pos1319"></a>day, and yet according to him nothing to do with the incident, you cannot seriously suggest that that person </p>
<p class="line" id="line1320"><a name="pos1320"></a>couldn't have the right to cross-examine those people who say that he was involved?   Now, I am just </p>
<p class="line" id="line1321"><a name="pos1321"></a>making my point.  That is the one, that is the extreme case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1322"><a name="pos1322"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  I take the point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1323"><a name="pos1323"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:   I understand your difficulty with regards to, for example, a case and I myself would </p>
<p class="line" id="line1324"><a name="pos1324"></a>remain curious to what extent Mr -  without intimating that one would limit him, I would remain curious to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1325"><a name="pos1325"></a>see to what extent a person who admits that he was there, is going to cross-examine the witness when that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1326"><a name="pos1326"></a>person agrees entirely with the allegations.  But that does not affect the fundamental question of the right to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1327"><a name="pos1327"></a>cross-examine the person, it only affects the question of the reasonable limit to which that person would be </p>
<p class="line" id="line1328"><a name="pos1328"></a>entitled to cross-examine.  And I think we should maybe leave it at that point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1329"><a name="pos1329"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Yes, Mr Chairman, in that regard I just want to make this clear, and that is the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1330"><a name="pos1330"></a>procedure that Mr Visser is following is that he is providing us and the Committee with affidavits, either </p>
<p class="line" id="line1331"><a name="pos1331"></a>admitting that what was said about his clients are true, or otherwise disputing certain aspects of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1332"><a name="pos1332"></a>applicants' evidence. Now if Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line1333"><a name="pos1333"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line1334"><a name="pos1334"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	210	ADDRESS</p>
<p class="line" id="line1335"><a name="pos1335"></a>Visser is allowed, in respect of a dispute, if we take that, because where they admit the correctness of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1336"><a name="pos1336"></a>applicants' evidence I don't have a problem.   But if there is a dispute of one of his clients with the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1337"><a name="pos1337"></a>applicants' evidence, if he is allowed to cross-examine an applicant it would mean that he could place his </p>
<p class="line" id="line1338"><a name="pos1338"></a>client's version before this Committee by way of affidavit which would not give me the opportunity to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1339"><a name="pos1339"></a>cross-examine that witness, but he can cross-examine the applicant on that version and put his witness' </p>
<p class="line" id="line1340"><a name="pos1340"></a>version to the applicant without the applicant having the opportunity to do it vice versa. I haven't </p>
<p class="line" id="line1341"><a name="pos1341"></a>considered that position yet, but that seems to me to lead to a direction where there might be prejudice for </p>
<p class="line" id="line1342"><a name="pos1342"></a>the applicants, Mr Chairman, and I am raising that now although that hasn't occurred yet, but it is going to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1343"><a name="pos1343"></a>occur.  Tat situation is going to occur.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1344"><a name="pos1344"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  The point is important you're making because it may just happen that even though Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line1345"><a name="pos1345"></a>Visser's clients agree in broad terms they may not differ with your clients' version on an important aspect of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1346"><a name="pos1346"></a>the matter, but that problem, let's see whether that kind of problem arises. Because the fact that he agrees </p>
<p class="line" id="line1347"><a name="pos1347"></a>with, his clients agree with your clients' version does not mean that there may not be other things on which </p>
<p class="line" id="line1348"><a name="pos1348"></a>he is not entitled to put questions because they may agree, he may agree but find it necessary to put a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1349"><a name="pos1349"></a>slightly different complexion on the matter or emphasise in one or two other things and under those </p>
<p class="line" id="line1350"><a name="pos1350"></a>circumstances he would be entitled to put questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1351"><a name="pos1351"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Mr Chairman the only reason why I am raising the problem that is going to occur in </p>
<p class="line" id="line1352"><a name="pos1352"></a>respect of disputes is the fact that, that it is intricately bound to the question, does Mr Visser have the right </p>
<p class="line" id="line1353"><a name="pos1353"></a>to cross-</p>

<p class="line" id="line1356"><a name="pos1356"></a>examine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1357"><a name="pos1357"></a>JUDGE MALL:   Yes, I think that this is a matter of some importance, it is a question of interpretation to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1358"><a name="pos1358"></a>be placed on this Act, and I don't think that any of us can pretend that we have applied our minds in </p>
<p class="line" id="line1359"><a name="pos1359"></a>interpreting every section or every phrase in the Act.   There will come an appropriate time when we will </p>
<p class="line" id="line1360"><a name="pos1360"></a>have to take a decision in this matter. Whether that appropriate time is now or at some stage in the future, is </p>
<p class="line" id="line1361"><a name="pos1361"></a>a matter of which I have not made up my mind.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1362"><a name="pos1362"></a>ADV DE JAGER:   Mr du Plessis, a person who gave a command an instruction who is implied, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1363"><a name="pos1363"></a>implicated in the matter certainly has a right you should be allowed to protect, now if he has a right, what is </p>
<p class="line" id="line1364"><a name="pos1364"></a>your juridical objection against questions being posed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1365"><a name="pos1365"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Mr Chairman, yes,  like I said, I am not trying to make the point that he does not have </p>
<p class="line" id="line1366"><a name="pos1366"></a>the right, the point is that the Committee may limit cross-examination in terms of the Act and the point that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1367"><a name="pos1367"></a>I am trying to make Mr Chair is that should Mr Visser in this instance be allowed to cross-examine will he </p>
<p class="line" id="line1368"><a name="pos1368"></a>also be allowed to cross-examine in a case where his client has a dispute with one of the applicants?  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1369"><a name="pos1369"></a>Because the Committee has also made this decision.   Should this happen, Mr Chair, the applicant or </p>
<p class="line" id="line1370"><a name="pos1370"></a>applicants may be in the situation, problematic situation, where they will be confronted by an affidavit from </p>
<p class="line" id="line1371"><a name="pos1371"></a>the side of Mr Visser's clients, if those persons aren't here, we cannot cross-examine them but he has the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1372"><a name="pos1372"></a>right to cross-examine the applicants on exactly the same facts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1373"><a name="pos1373"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  You will have the right also to cross-examine him should the facts be disputed, but we </p>
<p class="line" id="line1374"><a name="pos1374"></a>are trying to limit matters and streamline the procedures and not to become too </p>

<p class="line" id="line1377"><a name="pos1377"></a>technical in the matter and we are trying to keep the process going and to complete it in everybody's </p>
<p class="line" id="line1378"><a name="pos1378"></a>interest as quickly as possible. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1379"><a name="pos1379"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:   Naturally, yes, Mr Chair, but I have to raise this point because I cannot simply let the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1380"><a name="pos1380"></a>process, should it be contrary to the provisions of the Act, simply continue and should it later become </p>
<p class="line" id="line1381"><a name="pos1381"></a>apparent and I don't foresee the problem now that it will be to the disadvantage of or the prejudice of my </p>
<p class="line" id="line1382"><a name="pos1382"></a>clients, I can't turn around later and say that I have a problem, I have to put it on the table now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1383"><a name="pos1383"></a>JUDGE MALL:  We accept the fact that you are placing this on record and my Committee is of the view </p>
<p class="line" id="line1384"><a name="pos1384"></a>that for present purposes, at any rate at this stage, having seeing the kind of affidavit that has been </p>
<p class="line" id="line1385"><a name="pos1385"></a>presented on behalf of his client, that if questions are asked, those questions may not go beyond what he </p>
<p class="line" id="line1386"><a name="pos1386"></a>said in that affidavit. For present purposes we are going to allow that and I am going to appeal to Mr Visser </p>
<p class="line" id="line1387"><a name="pos1387"></a>to confine, if he has any questions which are relevant, to confine them to what is contained in the affidavit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1388"><a name="pos1388"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  Could I raise a further matter which I think there seems to be some misunderstanding </p>
<p class="line" id="line1389"><a name="pos1389"></a>about. I understood Mr Visser to agree yesterday, I think when I put something to him, that if there was a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1390"><a name="pos1390"></a>substantial dispute of fact, he would not be entitled to put up an affidavit from his client, he would have to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1391"><a name="pos1391"></a>call his client to give evidence which appears to be the problem that Mr du Plessis is now contemplating </p>
<p class="line" id="line1392"><a name="pos1392"></a>that a dispute of facts will arise on affidavit as I understood the position, it was agreed yesterday that would </p>
<p class="line" id="line1393"><a name="pos1393"></a>not happen, that where there was to be </p>

<p class="line" id="line1396"><a name="pos1396"></a>a dispute of fact the witness, who was going to dispute the fact, would have to give evidence and you </p>
<p class="line" id="line1397"><a name="pos1397"></a>would have the right to cross-examination.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1398"><a name="pos1398"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Mr Chairman I am not sure that everybody understood it that way, if that is the case, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1399"><a name="pos1399"></a>if that is the case then obviously I will be entitled to cross-examine any witness who contradicts any of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1400"><a name="pos1400"></a>applicants and I am totally happy. I won't have any problem.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1401"><a name="pos1401"></a>MR VISSER:  If I may respond very shortly.   Commissioner Wilson is of course, quite correct, that was in </p>
<p class="line" id="line1402"><a name="pos1402"></a>relation to paragraph 4 at page 3 of the written representation which we handed in.   I am just beginning to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1403"><a name="pos1403"></a>wonder whether one shouldn't perhaps give these documents some sort of identification, perhaps "W" for </p>
<p class="line" id="line1404"><a name="pos1404"></a>Wagenaar 1, 2, 3 and 4.  It may facilitate reference to these documents.  May we mark this exhibit "W 1" </p>

<p class="line" id="line1406"><a name="pos1406"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Well, I think we have a list of exhibits here and if we can, if it is possible for us to be </p>
<p class="line" id="line1407"><a name="pos1407"></a>consistent we must give it the appropriate ...(intervention)</p>

<p class="line" id="line1435"><a name="pos1435"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  As far as I can remember Brigadier Schoon gave me the instruction in his office. I cannot </p>
<p class="line" id="line1436"><a name="pos1436"></a>remember of General Steenkamp entered and if I later, was later summoned by him, but the instruction </p>
<p class="line" id="line1437"><a name="pos1437"></a>came from both of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1438"><a name="pos1438"></a>MR VISSER:  The instruction from Schoon specifically, or let us say, from both of them, did they contain </p>
<p class="line" id="line1439"><a name="pos1439"></a>detail such that PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line1440"><a name="pos1440"></a>MR VISSER	214	BRIG CRONJE</p>
<p class="line" id="line1441"><a name="pos1441"></a>you should attack the house with stun grenades when you </p>
<p class="line" id="line1442"><a name="pos1442"></a>were going to find Nyanda?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1443"><a name="pos1443"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  I was left to my own devices as far as the circumstances which I would encounter there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1444"><a name="pos1444"></a>MR VISSER:  And you have already said that you knew nothing about McFadden prior to that, is that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1445"><a name="pos1445"></a>correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1446"><a name="pos1446"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1447"><a name="pos1447"></a>MR VISSER:  So, McFadden would not have come up in any of the discussions that you had had?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1448"><a name="pos1448"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1449"><a name="pos1449"></a>MR VISSER:  To just take it a bit further on what Mr Currin asked you, as far as McFadden is concerned </p>
<p class="line" id="line1450"><a name="pos1450"></a>did you become aware after that of any evidence which indicated that he was a terrorist or a collaborator?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1451"><a name="pos1451"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  Later information was received that - I wouldn't say that he was a terrorist, but that he </p>
<p class="line" id="line1452"><a name="pos1452"></a>was indeed a collaborator with Nyanda.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1453"><a name="pos1453"></a>MR VISSER:  Where did the information come from, could you tell us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1454"><a name="pos1454"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  Mr Chairperson, I do not know. I cannot remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1455"><a name="pos1455"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Do you know in which form this information came, was it verbal or was it by mean </p>
<p class="line" id="line1456"><a name="pos1456"></a>of documentation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1457"><a name="pos1457"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  I suspect that it would probably have been done in writing by an informant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1458"><a name="pos1458"></a>MR VISSER:  Did you have any insight into the documentation which you people seized at the house </p>
<p class="line" id="line1459"><a name="pos1459"></a>where Nyanda was found in Manzini?  Did you go through the documentation yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1460"><a name="pos1460"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  I went through it very briefly, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1461"><a name="pos1461"></a>MR VISSER:  Was there any reference in that document made to PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line1462"><a name="pos1462"></a>MR VISSER	215	BRIG CRONJE</p>
<p class="line" id="line1463"><a name="pos1463"></a>McFadden?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1464"><a name="pos1464"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  I do not believe that there was anything in there, as I said it was - it contained plans to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1465"><a name="pos1465"></a>attack defence force staff buses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1466"><a name="pos1466"></a>MR VISSER:  Mr Chairman that is all I wanted to ask. Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1467"><a name="pos1467"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR VISSER</p>
<p class="line" id="line1468"><a name="pos1468"></a>JUDGE MALL:   Any re-examination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1469"><a name="pos1469"></a>RE EXAMINATION BY ADV DU PLESSIS:  Yes Mr Chairman, thank you very much. Brigadier, the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1470"><a name="pos1470"></a>instruction which was given to you, let us just go through it again, what was the information available to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1471"><a name="pos1471"></a>you with regards to who could  possibly have been in that house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1472"><a name="pos1472"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  The information was that only Nyanda and Cecil were to be there.  I can just explain </p>
<p class="line" id="line1473"><a name="pos1473"></a>further that this investigation spanned over a long period of time and when we held observations on </p>
<p class="line" id="line1474"><a name="pos1474"></a>Nyanda, when we followed him, he and Cecil were always together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1475"><a name="pos1475"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Brigadier, was anything said at the time of the instruction being issued about your </p>
<p class="line" id="line1476"><a name="pos1476"></a>action in the case of anyone else being present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1477"><a name="pos1477"></a>BRIG CRONJE:   Chairperson, not as far as I can remember, but as I said, I could not wait and still ask </p>
<p class="line" id="line1478"><a name="pos1478"></a>McFadden "who are you?" and possibly die in the process myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1479"><a name="pos1479"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Brigadier Schoon and Steenkamp were they informed about the death of McFadden </p>
<p class="line" id="line1480"><a name="pos1480"></a>at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1481"><a name="pos1481"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  Yes, they were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1482"><a name="pos1482"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  What was their attitude at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1483"><a name="pos1483"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  They accepted it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1484"><a name="pos1484"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  During your training with regards to this type of operation, what did your training </p>
<p class="line" id="line1485"><a name="pos1485"></a>entail, what was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1486"><a name="pos1486"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line1487"><a name="pos1487"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	216	BRIG CRONJE</p>
<p class="line" id="line1488"><a name="pos1488"></a>expected of you during such operations where you did not know what to expect? </p>
<p class="line" id="line1489"><a name="pos1489"></a>BRIG CRONJE:   You had to shoot first and then ask questions later. Just to put it differently, you had no </p>
<p class="line" id="line1490"><a name="pos1490"></a>chance to ask the person any questions, your training entailed the fact that where you were in a situation </p>
<p class="line" id="line1491"><a name="pos1491"></a>where you knew that there were armed men or armed persons in a house, you would attack the house and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1492"><a name="pos1492"></a>shoot without checking whether the person was armed or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1493"><a name="pos1493"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Very well. Brigadier, the persons who you gave instruction to, were they also aware </p>
<p class="line" id="line1494"><a name="pos1494"></a>of that approach?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1495"><a name="pos1495"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  Yes, I should think so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1496"><a name="pos1496"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  And did they tell you before the time that you merely had instruction to eliminate </p>
<p class="line" id="line1497"><a name="pos1497"></a>only two persons or was nothing said about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1498"><a name="pos1498"></a>MR VISSER:  That's not the evidence,  The evidence was that there was an instruction to eliminate one </p>
<p class="line" id="line1499"><a name="pos1499"></a>specific person, not two.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1500"><a name="pos1500"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Very well, let me rephrase the question. The instruction which you had received with </p>
<p class="line" id="line1501"><a name="pos1501"></a>regards to the elimination, was the instruction to eliminate Nyanda only or what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1502"><a name="pos1502"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  Brigadier Schoon and Steenkamp were aware of the fact that this person, Cecil, was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1503"><a name="pos1503"></a>working with Nyanda.  It was contained in previous reports which were given to us so I could only assume </p>
<p class="line" id="line1504"><a name="pos1504"></a>that they knew that I would not have left Cecil there because I would have expected him also to have been </p>
<p class="line" id="line1505"><a name="pos1505"></a>armed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1506"><a name="pos1506"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Does this person Cecil have any name, any other name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1507"><a name="pos1507"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  He does Chairperson, but I have since </p>
<p class="line" id="line1508"><a name="pos1508"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line1509"><a name="pos1509"></a>JUDGE WILSON	216	BRIG CRONJE</p>
<p class="line" id="line1510"><a name="pos1510"></a>forgotten that name.   I cannot remember his surname.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1511"><a name="pos1511"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  The first question I have is for Mr Mpshe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1512"><a name="pos1512"></a>The woman in the house, has she been notified in any way? Has she been identified?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1513"><a name="pos1513"></a>ADV MPSHE:  Mr Chairman the woman has not been notified because she has not been identified.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1514"><a name="pos1514"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  Has any attempt being made to identify her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1515"><a name="pos1515"></a>ADV MPSHE:  The investigative unit has done that, they filed a report with me, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1516"><a name="pos1516"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  In the case of McFadden, has his family been notified?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1517"><a name="pos1517"></a>ADV MPSHE:  The same applies Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1518"><a name="pos1518"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  What?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1519"><a name="pos1519"></a>ADV MPSHE:  That they have not been identified and notified Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1520"><a name="pos1520"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  Well he has been identified positively.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1521"><a name="pos1521"></a>ADV MPSHE:  Mr Chairperson, I am referring to where to locate him, to locate the families thereof.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1522"><a name="pos1522"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  And presumably there was an inquest held by the Swaziland authorities?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1523"><a name="pos1523"></a>ADV MPSHE:  I may not know about the inquest in Swaziland, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1524"><a name="pos1524"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Were inquiries made?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1525"><a name="pos1525"></a>JUDGE MALL:  It was ten years ago this happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1526"><a name="pos1526"></a>ADV MPSHE:   Mr Chairman I am prepared to go and make available the report given to me by the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1527"><a name="pos1527"></a>Investigative Unit as far as this incident is concerned Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1528"><a name="pos1528"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  Because I ask these questions because it was put, I think, by Mr Currin that McFadden </p>
<p class="line" id="line1529"><a name="pos1529"></a>was living in that house and I think that if he was living there, if he was known to have been living there by </p>
<p class="line" id="line1530"><a name="pos1530"></a>people in the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1531"><a name="pos1531"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line1532"><a name="pos1532"></a>JUDGE WILSON	217	BRIG CRONJE</p>
<p class="line" id="line1533"><a name="pos1533"></a>neighbourhood it is extremely relevant to the inquiry as to the attack on him that night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1534"><a name="pos1534"></a>ADV MPSHE:  That is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1535"><a name="pos1535"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  We have no information, it is just that Mr Currin mentioned it. Is there information that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1536"><a name="pos1536"></a>he was living in that house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1537"><a name="pos1537"></a>ADV MPSHE:  I do not have that information. That was brought by Mr Currin.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1538"><a name="pos1538"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Right, now, can you tell me Brigadier what you were armed with that night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1539"><a name="pos1539"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  I was armed with an automatic 9 mm firearm Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1540"><a name="pos1540"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  And how many times did you shoot Mr McFadden?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1541"><a name="pos1541"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  Mr Chairperson,I cannot say, with an automatic weapon it is difficult to determine but I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1542"><a name="pos1542"></a>would never have emptied my entire magazine on him and then run the risk of having being without </p>
<p class="line" id="line1543"><a name="pos1543"></a>ammunition.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1544"><a name="pos1544"></a>JUDGE WILSON:   Now I ask you this because you chased this man into a bedroom where the light was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1545"><a name="pos1545"></a>on, he was wrapped in a blanket apparently, why did you kill him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1546"><a name="pos1546"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  As I had already said Mr Chairperson, I did not know what he could have had under that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1547"><a name="pos1547"></a>blanket, whether it was concealing a firearm or not. I could not have been sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1548"><a name="pos1548"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  You couldn't have been more than a few yards away from him, if that, could you, were </p>
<p class="line" id="line1549"><a name="pos1549"></a>you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1550"><a name="pos1550"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  I was standing in the doorway.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1551"><a name="pos1551"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  The bedroom door. Why didn't you shoot him through the shoulder or the leg, wound </p>
<p class="line" id="line1552"><a name="pos1552"></a>him so you could ask questions?  Why kill him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1553"><a name="pos1553"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  Mr Chairperson, I have already said that I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1554"><a name="pos1554"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line1555"><a name="pos1555"></a>JUDGE WILSON	218	BRIG CRONJE</p>
<p class="line" id="line1556"><a name="pos1556"></a>could not run the risk of injuring or missing him and then having him shoot me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1557"><a name="pos1557"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  So what was at stake was your life against his and you had no choice but to kill him, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1558"><a name="pos1558"></a>you didn't want to give him any chance, is that the position Brigadier?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1559"><a name="pos1559"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  That was my perception at the time that if I did not shoot he would shoot and I could </p>
<p class="line" id="line1560"><a name="pos1560"></a>possibly have died.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1561"><a name="pos1561"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  You could have watched and seen whether he produced a gun from under the blanket </p>
<p class="line" id="line1562"><a name="pos1562"></a>that was wrapped around him. You were in the dominant position, weren't you, standing, armed, ready to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1563"><a name="pos1563"></a>shoot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1564"><a name="pos1564"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  Chairperson I explained that I kicked the door open and started firing immediately, I did </p>
<p class="line" id="line1565"><a name="pos1565"></a>not wait to see whether he had a firearm or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1566"><a name="pos1566"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  You didn't wait to see.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1567"><a name="pos1567"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  I was in as much danger if he had had a firearm and had shot at me. It would have been </p>
<p class="line" id="line1568"><a name="pos1568"></a>my life and not his.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1569"><a name="pos1569"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  Brigadier do you know if Eugene de Kok was charged in connection with this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1570"><a name="pos1570"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  No Chairperson, I do not believe that he was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1571"><a name="pos1571"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  Was this not one of the charges which was brought against him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1572"><a name="pos1572"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  No. I think that because it was in Swaziland he was not charged.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1573"><a name="pos1573"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  You testified of your own and tell me if I am wrong because I got the impression that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1574"><a name="pos1574"></a>you said that because you had been told that Cecil was to be found in the house, you were under a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1575"><a name="pos1575"></a>misconception that McFadden could have been Cecil and that is why you shot him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1576"><a name="pos1576"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  That is correct and then I would have known </p>
<p class="line" id="line1577"><a name="pos1577"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line1578"><a name="pos1578"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE	219	BRIG CRONJE</p>
<p class="line" id="line1579"><a name="pos1579"></a>the opposite that Cecil would have been armed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1580"><a name="pos1580"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  Now, I am not so sure, at the end of the day whether you killed Mr McFadden because </p>
<p class="line" id="line1581"><a name="pos1581"></a>you were worried that he might produce a firearm from underneath the blanket or you are saying that you </p>
<p class="line" id="line1582"><a name="pos1582"></a>shot him because you thought you were killing Cecil?  Or whether it is both reasons combined.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1583"><a name="pos1583"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  If I had found Cecil there I would definitely have shot him but I was not sure if it was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1584"><a name="pos1584"></a>him and I was trying to prevent the fact that McFadden was Cecil.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1585"><a name="pos1585"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:    But you did see somebody jump out of the window?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1586"><a name="pos1586"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  No Chairperson, I heard about that later.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1587"><a name="pos1587"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  Oh, 54.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1588"><a name="pos1588"></a>		"Thereafter he went into the bathroom and he locked himself in, somebody else who was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1589"><a name="pos1589"></a>in the house jumped out of the window and ran away".</p>
<p class="line" id="line1590"><a name="pos1590"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  I could have put it like that, but as I said I was in the house at that time and I could not </p>
<p class="line" id="line1591"><a name="pos1591"></a>see that window and I heard that from one of my people later.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1592"><a name="pos1592"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  Is that what you were told, that somebody jumped out of the window?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1593"><a name="pos1593"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  Ja, that is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1594"><a name="pos1594"></a>JUDGE MGOEPE:  I see.  But I think I was under the wrong impression because it doesn't say that - you </p>
<p class="line" id="line1595"><a name="pos1595"></a>don't say in your statement, you don't say that somebody told you so. But I will accept what you are telling </p>
<p class="line" id="line1596"><a name="pos1596"></a>me that you got the information from somebody else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1597"><a name="pos1597"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  Thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1598"><a name="pos1598"></a>MS KHAMPEPE:  Mr Cronje, when you obtained a report from the informers in Piet Retief, that Mr </p>
<p class="line" id="line1599"><a name="pos1599"></a>Nyanda was staying with another person by the name of Cecil, did you make any </p>
<p class="line" id="line1600"><a name="pos1600"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line1601"><a name="pos1601"></a>MS KHAMPEPE	220	BRIG CRONJE</p>
<p class="line" id="line1602"><a name="pos1602"></a>attempt to get in touch with both Brigadier Schoon and General Steenkamp to inform them that you have </p>
<p class="line" id="line1603"><a name="pos1603"></a>now come into possession of other important information that another important and dangerous person was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1604"><a name="pos1604"></a>staying in the house where Mr Nyanda was staying? Did you make any attempt to get in touch with your </p>
<p class="line" id="line1605"><a name="pos1605"></a>superiors about that information?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1606"><a name="pos1606"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  As I said, Nyanda and Cecil were always together and my commanding officers knew </p>
<p class="line" id="line1607"><a name="pos1607"></a>that so they could have assumed that Cecil could well have been there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1608"><a name="pos1608"></a>MS KHAMPEPE:  But the instructions from Brigadier Schoon and General Steenkamp was to eliminate </p>
<p class="line" id="line1609"><a name="pos1609"></a>Mr Nyanda and Mr Nyanda only?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1610"><a name="pos1610"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  I assume and I believe that they would also have given permission that Cecil also be </p>
<p class="line" id="line1611"><a name="pos1611"></a>eliminated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1612"><a name="pos1612"></a>MS KHAMPEPE:  Were there any difficulties you would have encountered in confirming those </p>
<p class="line" id="line1613"><a name="pos1613"></a>assumptions with Brigadier Schoon and General Steenkamp?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1614"><a name="pos1614"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  Could you please repeat the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1615"><a name="pos1615"></a>MS KHAMPEPE:  Would it have been difficult for you to confirm your assumption that the instructions to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1616"><a name="pos1616"></a>eliminate Mr Nyanda also would have applied to Mr Cecil? What would have been difficult for you to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1617"><a name="pos1617"></a>confirm that with both Brigadier Schoon and General Steenkamp?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1618"><a name="pos1618"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  I believed that they would have granted permission anyway because Cecil was also a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1619"><a name="pos1619"></a>trained terrorist who was assisting Nyanda in these operations so I did not expect them to object such a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1620"><a name="pos1620"></a>thing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1621"><a name="pos1621"></a>MS KHAMPEPE:  Are you saying then, Mr Cronje, that the information about Cecil was also the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1622"><a name="pos1622"></a>information which was in the knowledge of both Brigadier Schoon and General Steenkamp, I thought that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1623"><a name="pos1623"></a>was the information that you </p>

<p class="line" id="line1625"><a name="pos1625"></a>MS KHAMPEPE	220	BRIG CRONJE</p>
<p class="line" id="line1626"><a name="pos1626"></a>obtained from the informers in Piet Retief?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1627"><a name="pos1627"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  No, no, no. Brigadier Schoon and General Steenkamp knew beforehand that Cecil was </p>
<p class="line" id="line1628"><a name="pos1628"></a>working with Nyanda.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1629"><a name="pos1629"></a>MS KHAMPEPE:  Yet, Mr Cronje, they made no mention they gave no instructions that you should </p>
<p class="line" id="line1630"><a name="pos1630"></a>eliminate Mr Cecil as well. Isn't that strange?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1631"><a name="pos1631"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  I believe that they would have issued that instruction Chairperson, I have no doubt about </p>
<p class="line" id="line1632"><a name="pos1632"></a>that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1633"><a name="pos1633"></a>MS KHAMPEPE:  If they had known about Mr Cecil, is that not a fact?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1634"><a name="pos1634"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  They knew about Cecil and that he was operating with Nyanda.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1635"><a name="pos1635"></a>JUDGE MALL:  The question was, why did they not give you instructions to eliminate Cecil if they knew </p>
<p class="line" id="line1636"><a name="pos1636"></a>all this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1637"><a name="pos1637"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  Chairperson, I can only say that if they had given me the instruction or had said that I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1638"><a name="pos1638"></a>should eliminate Nyanda that it is possible that they could have said both. I believe they did say so to me </p>
<p class="line" id="line1639"><a name="pos1639"></a>but I did not mention it like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1640"><a name="pos1640"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  Are you now changing your evidence and saying they did give you instructions to kill </p>
<p class="line" id="line1641"><a name="pos1641"></a>Cecil? Is that what you have just said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1642"><a name="pos1642"></a>BRIG CRONJE:   Chairperson, I am saying that they would have had no objection if I had eliminated Cecil </p>
<p class="line" id="line1643"><a name="pos1643"></a>as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1644"><a name="pos1644"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  Brigadier there was no objection because they gave you a medal for what you had </p>
<p class="line" id="line1645"><a name="pos1645"></a>done.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1646"><a name="pos1646"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  That is correct Chairperson, and they had no objection that night and the morning when I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1647"><a name="pos1647"></a>filled them in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1648"><a name="pos1648"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  So they knew what you had done and they knew that you had killed McFadden as well </p>
<p class="line" id="line1649"><a name="pos1649"></a>and they gave you the </p>

<p class="line" id="line1653"><a name="pos1653"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1654"><a name="pos1654"></a>MR VISSER:  Mr Chairman may I be permitted to place something on record here.  The evidence which is </p>
<p class="line" id="line1655"><a name="pos1655"></a>now been elicited, as you understand was not on the notice which Brigadier Schoon received. I can't </p>
<p class="line" id="line1656"><a name="pos1656"></a>respond to it right now because I don't have any instructions on it. May, if necessary, it be raised again at a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1657"><a name="pos1657"></a>later stage, Mr Chairman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1658"><a name="pos1658"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Well Brigadier Schoon will give evidence at some stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1659"><a name="pos1659"></a>MR VISSER:  He will give evidence, yes. I don't think that you need that resolved in order for you to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1660"><a name="pos1660"></a>consider the amnesty application, so it can conveniently be mentioned later.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1661"><a name="pos1661"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Yes. Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1662"><a name="pos1662"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Brigadier, this Cecil was he a high profile activist?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1663"><a name="pos1663"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  Yes, he was Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1664"><a name="pos1664"></a>JUDGE MALL:  No, he said he was a trained terrorist.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1665"><a name="pos1665"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:   Yes. Brigadier did you and Brigadier Schoon and General Steenkamp know exactly </p>
<p class="line" id="line1666"><a name="pos1666"></a>who was going to be in the house that night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1667"><a name="pos1667"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  I do not believe that they would have known who were all in the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1668"><a name="pos1668"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  And the instruction was to eliminate Nyanda but if you had asked during the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1669"><a name="pos1669"></a>discussion when you were receiving your instructions what happens if there are any other persons or any </p>
<p class="line" id="line1670"><a name="pos1670"></a>other armed persons in the house what do you think the instruction would have been?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1671"><a name="pos1671"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  The same as the instruction with regards to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1672"><a name="pos1672"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line1673"><a name="pos1673"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS	222	BRIG CRONJE</p>
<p class="line" id="line1674"><a name="pos1674"></a>Nyanda.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1675"><a name="pos1675"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Brigadier, would it have been normal for you to execute such an operation and to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1676"><a name="pos1676"></a>foresee that you were only going to shoot one person or would it have been normal to foresee the fact that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1677"><a name="pos1677"></a>you would possibly shoot other persons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1678"><a name="pos1678"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  It would have been normal to foresee that there were possibly more persons who could </p>
<p class="line" id="line1679"><a name="pos1679"></a>be shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1680"><a name="pos1680"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Could you see whether McFadden was armed under the blanket or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1681"><a name="pos1681"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  No, I could not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1682"><a name="pos1682"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:   Did you expect that he would be armed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1683"><a name="pos1683"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1684"><a name="pos1684"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  Should you not as any normal careful person who has a respect for life have taken </p>
<p class="line" id="line1685"><a name="pos1685"></a>some steps to see who is in the house before you come to the conclusion that it is normal to foresee that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1686"><a name="pos1686"></a>other people might be killed? Isn't it normal to take steps to find out who they are?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1687"><a name="pos1687"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  According to the informant it would only have been Nyanda and Cecil in the house and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1688"><a name="pos1688"></a>our information was that Nyanda was renting that house for his own purposes, so I could not have foreseen </p>
<p class="line" id="line1689"><a name="pos1689"></a>that McFadden would have been there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1690"><a name="pos1690"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  You could have sent someone to look couldn't you? You were relying on information </p>
<p class="line" id="line1691"><a name="pos1691"></a>you had been given at Piet Retief, you were now in Manzini, quite a way away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1692"><a name="pos1692"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  This informant lived in Swaziland not far from this house and according to this informant </p>
<p class="line" id="line1693"><a name="pos1693"></a>it was Nyanda and Cecil's house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1694"><a name="pos1694"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  So you only discovered from the informant that it was Nyanda and Cecil's house?  Is </p>

<p class="line" id="line1698"><a name="pos1698"></a>now saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1699"><a name="pos1699"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  That is correct, we did not know that there would be other people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1700"><a name="pos1700"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Mr Mpshe are there any questions you wish to put.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1701"><a name="pos1701"></a>ADV MPSHE:  I do not have question, Mr Chairman, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1702"><a name="pos1702"></a>NO CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MPSHE</p>
<p class="line" id="line1703"><a name="pos1703"></a>JUDGE MALL:   Yes very well you are excused.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1705"><a name="pos1705"></a>MR VISSER:  Mr Chairman, I wonder, could I ask one more question, perhaps it may solve the problem of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1706"><a name="pos1706"></a>whether I am acting for Steenkamp or not. If I could just ask the Brigadier whether he can give us a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1707"><a name="pos1707"></a>christian name of the Steenkamp that he is referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1708"><a name="pos1708"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Certainly - clear that up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1709"><a name="pos1709"></a>MR VISSER:  The General Steenkamp you refer to is it Francois Steenkamp?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1710"><a name="pos1710"></a>BRIG CRONJE:  No, it is Frans Steenkamp.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1711"><a name="pos1711"></a>MR VISSER:   Thank you Brigadier. The mystery deepens, I do appear for Frans Steenkamp but there is </p>
<p class="line" id="line1712"><a name="pos1712"></a>no reference to this incident, Mr Chairman.   I will have to follow it up.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1724"><a name="pos1724"></a>in as far as the victim is concerned. The victim is in this matter, Mr Chairperson, a Mr Dondsi Khumalo, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1725"><a name="pos1725"></a>who is a Councellor in this Council, he knew about this matter since last year I have been in </p>
<p class="line" id="line1726"><a name="pos1726"></a>communication with him. Today during lunch Mr Chairperson, I got him on the cellphone to check </p>
<p class="line" id="line1727"><a name="pos1727"></a>whether he is on the way to the hearing and he indicated to me that he would not be able to attend the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1728"><a name="pos1728"></a>hearing he has a meeting in Bloemfontein - actually he was on the way to Bloemfontein but he asked me to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1729"><a name="pos1729"></a>put it on record that he does not oppose the application for Amnesty as done by the applicants and that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1730"><a name="pos1730"></a>further to put on record that he did not sustain any injury whatsoever and further that actually the Izoso </p>
<p class="line" id="line1731"><a name="pos1731"></a>House that was blown by the applicants is not his house, they blew a wrong Izoso house, his was the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1732"><a name="pos1732"></a>neighbouring Izoso house, so he is not affected, thank you Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1733"><a name="pos1733"></a>ADV. DE JAGER:  What about the true victim then, whose house was blown? He suffered injuries not the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1734"><a name="pos1734"></a>supposed victim?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1735"><a name="pos1735"></a>ADV. MPSHE:  That is true, I do not know who the true victims are and if I remember from the applicants </p>
<p class="line" id="line1736"><a name="pos1736"></a>they stated clearly that nobody was injured save that the Izoso house was blown up and even with him, he </p>
<p class="line" id="line1737"><a name="pos1737"></a>says it was not his Izoso House - and he does not know to whom did that one belong, it was in sort of a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1738"><a name="pos1738"></a>Izoso Houses in a cluster form. Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1739"><a name="pos1739"></a>JUDGE MALL:  We will hear about it just now. Will somebody tell was what is a "Izoso House"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1740"><a name="pos1740"></a>MR VISSER:  Mr Chairperson it is one of these pre-fabricated houses, manufactured of wood which one </p>
<p class="line" id="line1741"><a name="pos1741"></a>can move easily from one place to the other - it can be assembled and disassembled from one place to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1742"><a name="pos1742"></a>other and it is 3m x 3m - the one that is involved in this matter - one can get different dimensions.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1744"><a name="pos1744"></a>ADV. MPSHE:  Mr Chairperson, the reason why I gave this, I put this information on record is to indicate </p>

<p class="line" id="line1785"><a name="pos1785"></a>ADV MPSHE:  Mr Chairman then the reason why I gave this, I put this information on record is to indicate </p>
<p class="line" id="line1786"><a name="pos1786"></a>to the Committee that this will then be one of the matters where only confirmation will be involved by the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1787"><a name="pos1787"></a>applicants.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1788"><a name="pos1788"></a>JUDGE MALL:  I see. Very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1789"><a name="pos1789"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Thank you Mr Chairperson, I would beg leave to call Capt Hechter first please. </p>

<p class="line" id="line1795"><a name="pos1795"></a>CAPT HECHTER:  That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1796"><a name="pos1796"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Do you affirm the information which is contained in Schedule 24, page 302 of the </p>

<p class="line" id="line1798"><a name="pos1798"></a>CAPT HECHTER:  That is positively so, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1799"><a name="pos1799"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Captain Hechter I would like to ask you one or two questions in this regard as far as </p>
<p class="line" id="line1800"><a name="pos1800"></a>paragraph 1 is concerned.  The two activists regarding whom you received information as to their being </p>
<p class="line" id="line1801"><a name="pos1801"></a>asleep in this house, were they involved in serious crimes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1802"><a name="pos1802"></a>CAPT HECHTER:  Yes, that is correct, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1803"><a name="pos1803"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  How did you receive your information?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1804"><a name="pos1804"></a>CAPT HECHTER:  We at that stage only reacted to source reports and if the source reports indicated that </p>
<p class="line" id="line1805"><a name="pos1805"></a>these persons were very active in intimidation, burnings, arson etc. then we decided to act on this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1806"><a name="pos1806"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  If you page to page 310, will you please do so, there you mention upon whose </p>
<p class="line" id="line1807"><a name="pos1807"></a>instructions you were reacting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1808"><a name="pos1808"></a>CAPT HECHTER:  I will stick to that, it was the instruction of Brigadier Victor and Mr Villiers to control </p>
<p class="line" id="line1809"><a name="pos1809"></a>the situation in Mamelodi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1810"><a name="pos1810"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Captain Hechter, the political motivation which you find from page 306 onwards to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1811"><a name="pos1811"></a>309, do these things agree with the political motivation which you have already testified to in broad terms </p>
<p class="line" id="line1812"><a name="pos1812"></a>to this Commission?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1813"><a name="pos1813"></a>CAPT HECHTER:  Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1814"><a name="pos1814"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  With regard to information and dis-information and intimidation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1815"><a name="pos1815"></a>CAPT HECHTER:  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1816"><a name="pos1816"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  And also the more detailed information contained on 308 and 309?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1820"><a name="pos1820"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Thank you Mr Chairman I don't know if the  Commission wants any further detailed </p>
<p class="line" id="line1821"><a name="pos1821"></a>evidence. I don't think it's necessary.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1822"><a name="pos1822"></a>JUDGE MALL:  I just want to quickly look through some of it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1823"><a name="pos1823"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  Can I mention one thing which might be of assistance to my colleagues.  T this is one </p>
<p class="line" id="line1824"><a name="pos1824"></a>of the items where there has been alteration and it is on page 23 of that file we were given of alterations.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1825"><a name="pos1825"></a>The major difference is now amnesty is being asked for damage to property.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1826"><a name="pos1826"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Yes, yes, yes  Mr Chairman. I don't seem to be able to find my list, but that is the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1827"><a name="pos1827"></a>case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1828"><a name="pos1828"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  It is on page 23 of the bundle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1829"><a name="pos1829"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Yes, that would be correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1830"><a name="pos1830"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  Was there not an attempted murder?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1831"><a name="pos1831"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Yes, Mr Chair that has already been contained in Schedule 24 of Captain Hechter's </p>
<p class="line" id="line1832"><a name="pos1832"></a>application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1833"><a name="pos1833"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  Not on the improved one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1834"><a name="pos1834"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  No the improved schedules are just additions, it only contains additions so that which </p>
<p class="line" id="line1835"><a name="pos1835"></a>had been applied for earlier remained in force, it is just in the schedule of "Additions and Alterations".  I </p>
<p class="line" id="line1836"><a name="pos1836"></a>am sorry if there is an understanding in this regard.  You will notice that the Committee had asked me in </p>
<p class="line" id="line1837"><a name="pos1837"></a>October with regard to certain transgressions in terms of specific Acts and that constitutes the core of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1838"><a name="pos1838"></a>alterations and this is set out in the schedule.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1839"><a name="pos1839"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  I am glad you told me because I thought the schedule was to replace what had been </p>
<p class="line" id="line1840"><a name="pos1840"></a>stated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1841"><a name="pos1841"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  No, I am sorry, that was a misunderstanding, I didn't express myself clearly. Mr Chair </p>

<p class="line" id="line1861"><a name="pos1861"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN:  That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1862"><a name="pos1862"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  On page 95 you state upon whose instructions you were acting, whose were those </p>
<p class="line" id="line1863"><a name="pos1863"></a>instructions?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1865"><a name="pos1865"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  But you acted in direct command of Captain Hechter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1866"><a name="pos1866"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN:  Yes, that is correct, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1867"><a name="pos1867"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  And you also confirm the political motive as set out from page 91 up to and including </p>
<p class="line" id="line1868"><a name="pos1868"></a>page 94, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1869"><a name="pos1869"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN:  That is correct, Mr Chairperson.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1877"><a name="pos1877"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Were people actually present in their hut.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1878"><a name="pos1878"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN:   I assumed so, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1879"><a name="pos1879"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  When you went there that evening, did you know for sure that they would be in the </p>

<p class="line" id="line1886"><a name="pos1886"></a>NO CROSS-EXAMINATION BY ADV MPSHE</p>
<p class="line" id="line1887"><a name="pos1887"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  Isn't this the case when Captain Hechter came back he said, "anybody who was so </p>
<p class="line" id="line1888"><a name="pos1888"></a>lucky, who had so much luck on their side, he'd rather leave alone"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1889"><a name="pos1889"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN:  That is correct, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1890"><a name="pos1890"></a>JUDGE WILSON:  The house had been blown down and they hadn't been hurt?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1891"><a name="pos1891"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN:  That is correct, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1892"><a name="pos1892"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Just to refresh my memory, how was the house demolished, how was it blown down?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1893"><a name="pos1893"></a>W/O VAN VUUREN:  Captain Hechter and I one night went to the house, Captain Hechter carried the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1894"><a name="pos1894"></a>self-constructed bomb, I knocked out the window with an AK47 and Captain Hechter threw the bomb into </p>
<p class="line" id="line1895"><a name="pos1895"></a>the house, we turned around and ran away, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1896"><a name="pos1896"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Thank you very much.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1900"><a name="pos1900"></a>ADV MPSHE:  That will be all Mr Chairman.  That will then call for an adjournment to the following day, </p>
<p class="line" id="line1901"><a name="pos1901"></a>Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1902"><a name="pos1902"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Is there no other matter that we can dispose of?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1903"><a name="pos1903"></a>ADV MPSHE:  No, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1904"><a name="pos1904"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Counsel are aware of the fact that because this venue is required for a meeting by the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1905"><a name="pos1905"></a>Council we are expected to vacate shortly and that is why we can't proceed for the rest of this afternoon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1906"><a name="pos1906"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Yes, Mr Chairperson, we are aware of that, we thought that this matter would take a </p>
<p class="line" id="line1907"><a name="pos1907"></a>little bit longer than it did, otherwise we might have been able to arrange for something else.  Yes, but in </p>
<p class="line" id="line1908"><a name="pos1908"></a>any event, any of the other matters would have had to stand over, and if they had to stand over there would </p>
<p class="line" id="line1909"><a name="pos1909"></a>be General van der Merwe's evidence inbetween which we thought would not be appropriate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1910"><a name="pos1910"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Yes, it would be inconvenient.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1911"><a name="pos1911"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1912"><a name="pos1912"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Can we resume again at 9.00 tomorrow morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1913"><a name="pos1913"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Yes, thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1914"><a name="pos1914"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Mr Mpshe, will you see to it that everybody that is involved will be available and ready to </p>
<p class="line" id="line1915"><a name="pos1915"></a>proceed at 9.00am.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1916"><a name="pos1916"></a>ADV MPSHE:  That will be done, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1917"><a name="pos1917"></a>JUDGE MALL:  As I understand it, we will begin with Mr Van der Merwe, is it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1918"><a name="pos1918"></a>ADV MPSHE:  Mr Chairman it will be General van der Merwe and thereafter KwaNdebele Nine and </p>
<p class="line" id="line1919"><a name="pos1919"></a>thereafter Pepco Three.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1920"><a name="pos1920"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  Mr Mpshe have you managed to receive any information about the identity of the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1921"><a name="pos1921"></a>KwaNdebele Nine?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1922"><a name="pos1922"></a>ADV MPSHE:  Mr Chairman I do not have it at hand but I had </p>
<p class="line" id="line1923"><a name="pos1923"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line1924"><a name="pos1924"></a>231</p>
<p class="line" id="line1925"><a name="pos1925"></a>a discussion this morning with a Dr Pretorius together with Mrs Antionette De Jager and they said to me </p>
<p class="line" id="line1926"><a name="pos1926"></a>they could not do anything in this regard, but they will give me whatever they have done so far and I am of </p>
<p class="line" id="line1927"><a name="pos1927"></a>the mind that they will be able to give me information tomorrow to table before the Committee.  They said </p>
<p class="line" id="line1928"><a name="pos1928"></a>they will also unsuccessful but they will give whatever they have done.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1929"><a name="pos1929"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Mr Mpshe, while you are about it, Annexure 8 to the post mortem report ...(intervention) </p>
<p class="line" id="line1930"><a name="pos1930"></a>ADV MPSHE:  Yes, Mr Chairman, as I indicated yesterday that I got the post mortem attached to the </p>
<p class="line" id="line1931"><a name="pos1931"></a>report from the Investigative Unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1932"><a name="pos1932"></a>JUDGE MALL:  That's right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1933"><a name="pos1933"></a>ADV MPSHE:   But it is not difficult for me to obtain that Annexure A, because the inquest was held at </p>
<p class="line" id="line1934"><a name="pos1934"></a>Garankua, which is about 25 km from here, I have arranged for it to be brought.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1935"><a name="pos1935"></a>JUDGE MALL:  It's possible that it may very well be in the possession of the Attorney General's office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1936"><a name="pos1936"></a>ADV MPSHE:  They may also be having that, Mr Chairman, I can obtain it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1937"><a name="pos1937"></a>JUDGE MALL:  I think that if you just make a telephonic enquiry and find out, it might save some time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1938"><a name="pos1938"></a>ADV MPSHE:  Thank you Mr Chairman, I will do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1939"><a name="pos1939"></a>ADV DE JAGER:  It might have been handed in at the De Kok trial.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1940"><a name="pos1940"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1941"><a name="pos1941"></a>ADV MPSHE:  Yes, I think the Attorney General must be having that report of the inquest, but if they </p>
<p class="line" id="line1942"><a name="pos1942"></a>don't it is available at the Magistrate's Offices.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1943"><a name="pos1943"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Yes, Mr Chairman, I was also told this </p>
<p class="line" id="line1944"><a name="pos1944"></a>PRETORIA HEARING	AMNESTY/GAUTENG</p>
<p class="line" id="line1945"><a name="pos1945"></a>232</p>
<p class="line" id="line1946"><a name="pos1946"></a>morning that it was part of the evidence in the De Kok trial, so it is ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1947"><a name="pos1947"></a>JUDGE MALL:  Evidence by - Mamasela?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1948"><a name="pos1948"></a>ADV DU PLESSIS:  Well, part of the State's evidence in the De Kok trial.  So it might be part of the Court </p>
<p class="line" id="line1949"><a name="pos1949"></a>record of that hearing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1950"><a name="pos1950"></a>JUDGE MALL:   Yes, very well. If there is nothing that can usefully occupy us, we will adjourn and we </p>
<p class="line" id="line1951"><a name="pos1951"></a>will resume at 9.00 o'clock tomorrow morning. Thank you.</p>
