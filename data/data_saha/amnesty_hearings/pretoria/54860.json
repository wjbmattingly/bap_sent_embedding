I'm not going to read out the whole story, I'll just tell you very briefly - you are probably quite familiar with this case.\n\tMr Zondo was had been trained in Angola and he came to Natal to plant bombs and to incite terror and Amanzimtoti he learnt that there'd been a raid in Lesotho and that people had died.  He went to a restaurant, bought a paper, he saw the photographs of the people, he was very worked up about it and he decided he was going to do something.  \n\tHe went to the police station and he realised that he couldn't actually tackle the police station all by himself, so he then went and he thought about it and he decided to plant a bomb in a restaurant.  On the Monday he went and planted the bomb and if I remember correctly, nine people died and 40 were injured.\n\tAfterwards, they asked Mr Oliver Tambo what his view was on this matter and Mr Tambo said: \n\"Massacres have been perpetrated against civilians - Mamelodi - a massacre, Utenhage - a massacre, Botswana - a massacre, Queenstown - a massacre.  Certainly we are beginning to see South Africans of all races burying their loved ones who have died in the South African situation, the whole of South Africa is beginning to bleed.\n\tIf I had been approached by an ANC unit and asked whether they should go and plant a bomb at the supermarket, I would have said: \"of course not\" but when our units are faced with what is happening all around them, it is understandable that some of them should say: \"Well I may have to face being disciplined but I'm going to do this\"\n\tNow Sir, in exactly the same way the Conservative Party viewed the act of Mr Clive Derby-Lewis, we realised that the country was in a situation of murder and mayhem.  Political murders in 1993 were higher than in any other period before that and the people had been incited.  \n\tMr Hani had said that Whites should be maimed, members of Parliament should be killed, an army should be established and people died, there were necklace murders.  Leaders in Kwa Zulu Natal were killed and we realised that at some or other point the focus would be on the Afrikaners and we had to plan to protect ourselves against attacks such as these.  \n\tWe realised that a climate had been created in South Africa and there was a situation of high tension.  And we realised that Mr Clive Derby-Lewis had subjectively thought that he was acting in the cause of the Conservative Party and for the cause of the Afrikaner people and for that we had sympathy and that is why we supported him right from the outset because we accepted that he was acting on behalf of our cause.",
