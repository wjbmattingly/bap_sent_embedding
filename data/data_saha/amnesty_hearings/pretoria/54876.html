<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mpshe, are we ready to start?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman, thank you, we are still in the hands of Adv Bizos, Mr Chairman, we are ready to start.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Could you please excuse me Adv Bizos, I would just like to place something on record.  With regard to the video cassettes made available to us, one of these cassettes, tape number six, very clearly dealing with the interrogation of Mr Walus by Captain Deetliefs, I know that Adv Bizos' attorney also looked at this cassette, watched it and the person in control of the sound system was asked this morning whether he could possibly test the cassette for me as well, because his apparatus is much stronger than the type that one has at home, but the sound does not come through at all in this particular interrogation.  Captain Holmes, yesterday was requested by me to see if there were, perhaps, other tapes relating to the interrogation and he informed me that Captain Nick Deetliefs, the person who did the interrogation, was in possession of the same tape, but with the sound being of a better quality. I would like to request the Committee that Captain Holmes be instructed to place us in possession of that cassette, because it is absolutely essential before Mr Walus can testify to look at this tape and I would not like a delay at a later stage.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What can you tell us about that Adv Bizos?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> About those tapes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, about the tapes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Mr Chairman, we are not clear precisely what the position is.  May I ask that this question be left over until Captain Holmes arrives.  I have asked him to be here this morning.  We need not take up more time in relation to it.  Could we wait until Mr, Captain, the then, he is promoted now, but the then Captain Holmes...</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Comes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mrs van der Walt, we will deal with that matter at an appropriate stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Thank you Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Mr Derby-Lewis, you are reminded that you are still under your former oath.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">CLIVE DERBY-LEWIS:</span> (Still under affirmation).</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR BIZOS:</span> (cont)</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a>	Mr Derby-Lewis, you signed two application forms for amnesty.  Is that correct?  </p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Yes, yes, I am not clear, Mr Chairman, on whether the first form I signed was for amnesty or indemnity.  Is that what Mr Bizos is referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> No, I did not use the word "indemnity".  I asked you whether you signed two applications for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I am not ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I am not sure, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> I beg your pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I am not sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> You are not sure?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well, ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Can I just have a minute to ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> ... let me try and help you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Have a look at the document which you signed on the 24th of April 1996 and tell us whether that is an application that you signed.  You can have my copy or you may, your attorney may also have it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> It is in the bundle A at page 11, is it not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> The ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> The application signed on the 24th of April 1996.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes, that is so.  And then ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Yes, yes, that is correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And then there was a subsequent application which is dated later, is it not or they are both dated the same time, but they are different.  I would just like you to explain why there are two applications with the same date and why they are different.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where are these to be found Mr Bizos?  All in bundle A?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Mr Chairman, there is one on the 24th of April which appears on page 13 and then there are substitute pages on a different application.  Yes, we got two from the Committee Secretary, Mr Chairman, and they are different.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, to the best of my knowledge, that was what caused the confusion at the last hearing and I believe it was explained to the Committee what happened. That, somehow or another, an incorrect document had arrived at the Committee and that it was then included in the application and we have another document and then we said, well, that documents which were submitted to the Committee, is the document which we had, but there was not a second application.  It was, as far as I remember, it was only in the, in relation to 9(4), nature and particulars, the motivation explanation.  Is that what Mr Bizos is referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes, in November new, in November last year new pages were put in which were not in the original application.  Do you agree with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> To which pages are, Mr Bizos referring to, Mr Chairman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> If you have a look at the application of Mr Walus has the date of the 30th day of November, but what I am concerned with is that there are applications with different, there are pages with different allegations and I want to know how that came about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, perhaps, before you ask him questions of that kind, I would like to know where these two applications are?  I have an application in manuscript, the form filled in in manuscript, attached to that are answers to certain paragraphs of the application form in a typed form.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now, are you referring to those?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Mr Chairman, we have the application which we have called the first application which appears, which we have marked 1 to 15.  May I just hand this up for you to have a look at, please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Because the original application you have referred to, which is at page 11 of bundle A, when it comes to paragraph seven, eight, nine and says see attached, see attached, see attached, see attached.  All of it says that and then there are the attached pages, the typed pages.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> We have been given two different versions and I do not think that the one version is before you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, we will have to sort that out.  Mr Mpshe, what can you tell us about this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Mr Chairman, thank you, there was, the applicant submitted only one application, Mr Chairman.  The one that is on, from page 11 to page ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> 13.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> ... as it goes on up to page 13.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> That is the only application filed by the applicant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> The only thing that was done by the applicant, Mr Chairman, is that they changed or amended the annexure to their application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In other words, from page 15 onwards?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> From page 15 onwards and, particularly, Mr Chairman, just for an example, page 17 thereof makes it clear what happened, page 17.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> It makes it clear that letters were written to the applicant that certain information has not been forthcoming or has not been given and they had to supply extra information to the original application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> So the only change, Mr Chairman, is not on the application itself, but is on the annexure responding to questions as clarified by page 17.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> While we are talking about this, I think I would like to draw attention to the fact that, as far as I have been able to see, my paragraph, pages 15 and 16 are identical.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> That is so, that is a duplication.  15 And 16 is one and the same.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Yes, it is a typing error.  Then we go on to 17 and then 94 at page 18 goes on to the end.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So what has happened then, Mr Bizos, it seems that the original application has been supplemented by additional information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In other words, there are not two separate applications.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Mr Chairman, may I just indicate that we have the differences between the old and the new application.  There were the application and, when I speak about application I speak about the filling in of the form and the typed addition to the form, there are difference which we have put together on the basis of the old and the new on an analysis.  In order to save time, may I hand that, may I hand up a document which shows the differences so that when I examine Mr Derby-Lewis on it, we can have, we do not have enough copies, but we can make them available.  I will, whilst they are being made I can just ask some preparatory questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, well, Mr Derby-Lewis, in fairness, should have before you whatever documents you use to supplement your original application which, I take it, is in typed form.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Would you make copies?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And if you have all the documents then we can proceed.  Do you have them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> No, Mr Chairman, I do not have the documents.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Though your own application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I have my own application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Supplemented by a number of ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> By the annexures.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That is right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Yes, I have them, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> May we have a copy from Mr Bizos, Mr Chairman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes, this was a document which I did not intend handing in, but they are my notes to put to the witness, but I have given it in as an assistance, because the witness and, apparently, his legal representatives are not aware of the differences or may not be aware of the differences and some of them are of a material nature.  This is why copies are being made and we will hand them to the witness and to each member of the Committee and to the legal representatives.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Mr Chairman, may I just come in just for convenience, Mr Chairman, the document handed in first by Mr Bizos, the alleged another application be numbered R7, please, and the document allegedly containing the difference between the first and the second application be referred to as R8.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Well, it is all part of the one bundle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> No, Mr Chairman, two separate documents were handed up just now.  Only one copy was given to the Chair, that would be R8, the one outlining the differences.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, but at some stage, I would like to know about this, which you conveniently wish to call R7, because R7 has the original application form which is in manuscript, which is already in bundle A.  Bundle A, as we have said, up to page 14, they were already annexed, they form part of R7 and then the rest are what appear in bundle A as pages 15 and then there are different pages.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Yes, could we perhaps, while the Chairman is talking, give the page numbers.  Page five of the bundle handed in by Mr Bizos is page 15 of bundle A.  Page six, seven, eight and nine of Mr Bizos' number, Mr Bizos' bundle does not appear to be part of bundle A.  Page ten of Mr Bizos' bundle appears to be page 23 of bundle A.  Page 11 of Mr Bizos' bundle appears to be page 24 of bundle A and it goes on, 24, 25 and 26.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So, there are some pages now which have been handed in by Mr Bizos that do not form part of bundle A?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes, the drive of what we are saying is that although the pages appear to be the same, the contents differs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Not of the ones I have given you, Mr Bizos, those are identical.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well, that may be, but there are differences between the composite application, which we call first application, and the composite second application which finds itself in bundle A and the document that we are making a copy of draws attention to those differences.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Well, where does the composite first application come from?  Mr Mpshe says the application in application A is the application lodged with the Committee.  Where does yours come from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well, it came to us, Mr Chairman, when we asked for a copy of the application.  We first received the first one and then we were given the second one, as amended.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Mr Mpshe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Mr Chairman, I will have to put this again on record.  The copy that Adv Bizos has ended up as R7, intended to be another application, is incorrect.  It is the original application filed by the applicant.  It is repeated that on my copy it does not show exactly when, correctly when this was filed.  This application was filed, I am trying to make it up here, on the fourth of May 1996.  So, it is still the original application.  The only change that was made by the application is in as far as answering of questions are concerned.  I can refer the Chair again to page ten, page ten of bundle A.  It is just an amendment to the answering of questions and not a new application.  Page ten is also a clarification to that.  The application still remains the same.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> But Mr Mpshe, I, whereabouts page 18 and so on of the, of bundle A, how does it relate to page six of the bundle which Mr Bizos has just given us, because both, they have a commonality.  Paragraph, they all purport to be paragraph 9(4), nature and particulars, but the contents differ.  Now, I do not know whether what you are saying is that pages 18 and so on replaced pages six of Mr Bizos' documents and so on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Mr Chair, as it can be noted, page five is an amendment filed by Janusz Walus and page 18 is amendment filed by Clive Derby-Lewis.  These are amendments from two different applicants.  Page five is that of Janusz Walus.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Yes, but page 18 is an amendment by Mr Derby-Lewis, but you see amending paragraph 9(4) as given to us by Mr Bizos.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> I have not seen what Mr Bizos has given you, I was never given a copy.  If I can just be allowed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Yes, please have a look at that, because it is confusing to us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It is, indeed, at this stage in the proceedings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Mr Chairman, it is true that the same application form may cover both.  What we are concerned with that between May and November the applications of both applicants were amended in certain respects.  That is the whole purpose and I want to ask questions as to how these amendments came to be made and why.  That is really the ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Well, I want to get clarity as to how and when, have you got the papers now, Mr Mpshe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> I do have the papers, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> If you will look at Mr Bizos' page six, that is nature and particulars and starts,</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a>"After the speech of F W de Klerk ...",</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a>in relation to paragraph 9(4).  Correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> I do have it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Now, in bundle A at page 18 ...</p>

<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> So, he is correct in saying there has been a substantial change to 9(4)?</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> That is correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Mr Mpshe will probably be able to confirm this, the fact raised by Judge Wilson, that it was faxed, I think he will have a letter, Mr Mpshe, will have a letter on his files in which the original document which was sent in November, apparently, somehow or other got lost at the Committee's offices and Mr Mpshe and I had a telephonic discussion and then it was faxed to him.  I think he will be able to confirm this and it will be in his files.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> That is correct, Mr Chairman, I can confirm that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, it now appears, Mr Derby-Lewis, that there have been certain additional pages that were not part of your original application, you are aware of those?</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you are about to be questioned on the difference between the contents of those pages and your original application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Now, Mr Chairman, I believe I am being questioned, but I would appreciate a short time just to peruse this document, because, you know, because, as Mr Bizos says, it differs from the other.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  How many pages are there that have to be perused?</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Four.</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Four, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Four pages.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Four pages.</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> And on the other one it is five.</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> These are my notes from cross-examination.  I am entitled to put these questions to Mr Derby-Lewis.  I am merely handing it in, in order to assist the Committee in order to solve the riddle of the different documents.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> I do not know, I am entitled to put the questions cold, with respect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, you are Mr Bizos.</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> May I proceed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Mr Chairman, with respect, we have not received the notes of Mr Bizos.  What we have received is the bundle, which is now referred as R7, and that is what the witness is asking the Committee's indulgence, he wants to peruse R7, which he did not have in his possession, and then compare it with the documents referred to which were submitted at a later stage, which comprises pages 17 to page 22.  That is what the witness asked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Mr Chairman, R7 comes from their file, Mr Chairman, ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> ... but the, let us, I will withdraw my objection, Mr Chairman, ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> ... for his looking at the document.  I do not know what he can do about it.  It may be quicker rather than having long arguments.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, because otherwise each time you put a question he will start paging through the documents to find ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Let him look at it.  I do not know what he can do with it, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Walus, Mr Prinsloo, without wasting too much time, can you quickly look through it, because I am sure a lot of this is very familiar to you.  It should not take you too long.</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I will do it as quickly as ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> These are part of your papers.</p>

<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I will certainly do it as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Alright.  We will stand down just for a few minutes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>

<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I trust that we are ready to proceed now.  Mr Bizos, you may proceed with your cross-examination.</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Derby-Lewis, the short adjournment was (speaker's microphone not on) did your wife join you and your legal representatives in consultation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I beg your pardon, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Did your wife join you in the consultation that you had during the adjournment that was granted by the Committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> My wife was present in the room.  She came to greet me, Mr Chairman, because she did not have time before the commencement of the session.</p>

<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, the document which is under question was the document which I sent in as part of my application before I had access to legal advice.  So, ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Who drew the application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I did, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Not your wife?</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Well, my wife filled in some of the questions as far as the attachment was concerned, but I drew the information up and provided it.  I had no access to the facilities, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> You did not have an access to The Patriot and the other documents that quoted there?  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, I am not aware of quotations out of The Patriot in my application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> The annexure to your application is full of quotations from The Patriot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Those were drawn up at my request, Mr Chairman.</p>

<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I beg your pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Who drew them up?</p>

<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Yes, at my request.  Who else would do it for me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Was it your wife here before the original commencement of the proceedings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Before the commencement of these proceedings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> This morning, yes, was it your wife up on the stage in order to see you before the proceedings commenced this morning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Very briefly, Mr Chairman.</p>

<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> No, but what you said that she came up, because she did not have time to see you in the morning, that was not quite correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> No, but I qualified my statement by saying that it was, she only was able to see me very briefly before the ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> You qualified that when I put it to you that your wife did, in fact, see you this morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I did not, Mr Chairman, I qualified it when I spoke to the Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think, Mr Bizos, let us get down to the real ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> To the substance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ... issues.</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Now, I am going to put to you that the amendments to the application were made in order to bring them, to bring your application into line, possibly some of the decisions given by the Committee, that you became aware of after you filed your original application.  What do you say to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, I say that that amendment was submitted on the advice of my attorneys who were responsible for the submissions from page 17 onwards on my behalf.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.  Now, let us just go through some of them, the more important ones.  I will refer to the summary, Mr Chairman, for the sake of...</p>

<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well, name one or two individuals of "we" on the right.  Name one or two of the "we" on the right when you wrote the word "we" there.</p>

<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, it will be clear from the congress records which I submitted in terms of the mobilisation application, that it was patently obvious that there were three options open to us.

So, that ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Mr Derby-Lewis, they are asking you for the names of people from the right, from the Conservative Party, just the names of individuals.</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> My colleagues in the caucus, Mr Chairman,</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> They have got names, do they not?</p>

<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Why did the AWB and Mr van Tonder come in, come to your mind and why did we have difficulty and to have to have judicial intervention before you could mention any name of a person in the Conservative Party?</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, I thought that by broadly referring to the Conservative Party it was clear who it was and as far as van Tonder and Terreblanche are concerned, I have attended meetings of theirs where these sentiments had been expressed.</p>

<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Now, is this true, Mr Derby-Lewis, in your second application, is it true?</p>

<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> I see, but now, is it true, as a matter of fact, that you, a person with military training, licensed firearm holder for many years, needed training with the stolen gun that you had obtained?</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> That is correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Now, the silencer is a special bit of equipment to be used particularly by assassins.</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> It has been used by assassins, yes, Mr Chairman.</p>

<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, it is quite clear that in the event of a night time attack, for example, the presence of a silencer at the end of the barrel would conceal the flashes and would then make it very difficult for anyone attacking to identify where I was returning fire from.</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Oh I see.</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Very clear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> But I thought that you were concerned about the neighbours.  You did not want any noise to be made for the benefit of the neighbours?</p>

<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes, I am sorry, I only read the precis on the, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Some element of surprise.  Now, surely, attackers do not, well let me put it this way.  Have you or have you ever heard anybody having a silencer for the purposes of using it for better self-defence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, I was not interested in anybody, I was interested in my own circumstances and in view of the fact that there had been attempts on my life in the past and that I had been officially notified by both the ANC and APLA that I was on their death list, I think it would be reasonable to expect something like that and to take the necessary precautions to protect my family and myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Let us go on to page three.  You describe Mr Hani in the first application, the first version of the application as a,</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a>"... former MK commander.</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> That is correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And that is amended to,</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a>" ... was a senior commander of MK.".</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> That is correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Why did you decide to change that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Because, once again, during consultation, Mr Chairman, my legal advisers believed that it was not correct to say that and they advised me to amend it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> But surely your legal advisers were there not, were not there to advise you to "change former MK commander" to "the senior commander of MK" if those were not the facts as you knew them when you first made, you made the first application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, when we consulted it actually came out that I was not referring to the late Chris Hani as a former commander, I was referring to him as the commander of MK and my legal team then advised me to change it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> But you described him as the "former commander".  What information did your legal representatives give you that made you change the allegation of fact, from a "former commander" as the, "was the senior commander of MK", why was that change made?</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I have explained that, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> You have, you think you have.  Very well.  Now, there was no allegation in the original application,</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a>"... a prime military target.".</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> That is correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Now, by the time this change was made did you know that in numerous applications for amnesty before the Committee, members of the security forces identified the people that they killed as military targets?</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I did not know that, Mr Chairman.  As far as my memory serves me, there was no mention of that in any of the communications or the publications to which I had access in prison and I was not present at the hearings of the Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> I see.  Were not the decisions of the Committee in the possession of your attorneys or your wife or your both?</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Certainly not, Mr Chairman, in the possession of my wife and, to the best of my knowledge, not in the possession of my attorneys, because this was only requested very recently.</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> On the bottom of page three,</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a>"Mr Hani said that he would regard White MP's of the ruling National Party and the far right Conservative Party as legitimate targets for attack".</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a>That is not repeated in the application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> That was, once again, on the advice of my legal representatives, Mr Chairman, and I think that I clarified that during evidence to the Committee last week.</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Why was that allegation left out of the application in its final form?</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> It was left out on the advise of my legal people, Mr Chairman.  You must ask them that question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> I see.  Well, did you not ask them whether they considered it irrelevant or is it, perhaps, because you had no evidence of Mr Hani saying that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, I may be a strange person, but I take the advice of my legal representatives without querying.  I place ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> What ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> ... absolute confidence in them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> What evidence did you have that Mr Hani said this when you made your original application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I knew about it, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> How did you know about it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Because I was affected by it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> I beg your pardon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I was affected by it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> How did you know that Mr Hani had said that,</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a>"... far right Conservative Party as legitimate targets ...",</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a>where did you see that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Well, I could not remember, Mr Chairman, ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> You could not remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> ... and that could be why my legal team advised me to take it out, but I subsequently became aware of a report in the London Times in 1988 in the United Kingdom which actually was, broadly, the same statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> But in your, as I understand it, what was your original application, you gave all this information, did you not?  Page eight was your original application, was it not?</p>

<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> ... bringing to our attention that what you have said immediately before was not correct.</p>

<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Page eight, paragraph 18.</p>

<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Is it 19, sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Then it could have been because I did not have access to the documentation at the time, Mr Chairman, but I cannot remember everything what I, what, but I want to stipulate that everything that I submitted was on the advice of my legal team.  That is why we submitted that application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Just show me the full text of this.</p>

<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a>Yes.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Who is the "we"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Walus and I.</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Just the two of you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> If you have a look at bundle A, page 21, paragraph eight ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Where is paragraph eight?  My page 21 has got three paragraphs on it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Could I refer to the middle paragraph.</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Where is that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> It is page 21.</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> You see the middle of the paragraph, of the middle paragraph of page 21, you actually place, you only mention that Mr,</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a>"He decided that he would deal with Chris Hani and set about planning his campaign.".</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> That was after I identified Mr Hani as the target, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Now, but why ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> He still had to make the decision to ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Why did the "we" become "he" in the second application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Once again, on the advice of my legal team, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And again, in the old application you say,</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a>"We decided that Mr Walus would reconnoitre Mr Hani's place of residence.".</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a>Do you see that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> That is correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> But that changes in,</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a>"He set out reconnoitring Hani's address.".</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a>Why did the "we" become "he".</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Because during our discussions it was clear to my legal representative that, in fact, Walus had said he would carry the recces, I did not decide that with him and that is why they advised me to change it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And then you say in the old,</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a>"I handed the firearm to Mr Walus on the sixth April in order to execute the plan.",</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a>but in the new application you say,</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a>"Although I handed Mr Walus the firearm on 6 April ... as I was determined to give as a matter that was as important and as significant as this one further thought.".</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a>Why was it decided to change that aspect of the application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> That was, once again, the advice of my legal representative, Mr Chairman, after consultation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> But, do you take advice from your legal advisers as to what the facts were or do you take advice as to what the Law or practice is?</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, I take advice from my legal advisers who advise me once they have heard what the facts were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And then you see the other two inconsistencies which are, I do not want to read out, but what I want to put to you is that there were material changes of fact between the two applications, both under oath, in order to assist yourself in the success of the application without any regard to the truth, particularly in relation to the matters to which I have drawn your attention.</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> That is not correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> That is not correct.  Now, I want to turn to your application.  The list, the list of facts.  In bundle A, I beg your pardon, the list is actually in bundle B, Mr Chairman.  Will you please have a look at bundle B, page two.  Okay.  Have you got it on page two of bundle B or one and two ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Again ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> ... in which annexure A is contained with a list of acts of violence committed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I have it, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> I want to confine myself from page one right up to the 10th of April 1993 in which your murder of Chris Hani is recorded and I want to ask you some questions of a general nature in relation to any one, to all of these acts.  Do you say that any of the acts listed in annexure A was done for or on behalf of the Conservative Party?</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I testified, Mr Chairman, that this list was drawn up by the Afrikaner Weerstand Beweeging and it was, according to them, an accurate record of all acts of violence or attack which had been carried out by people on the right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Please answer my question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I did not say anything about the CP, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> I asked you whether you pertain that anyone of these acts was committed for and on behalf of the Conservative Party, yes or no?</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> No, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> No.  Right.  We can proceed from there.  Would you agree that, except for your act on the 10th of April 1993, with one exception which I will draw your, possible exception that I will draw your attention to, that these acts of violence were directed at property rather than individuals?</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, I am not aware of when these acts were perpetrated, but I look at one on the 21st of December 1991 which says a bomb explodes at a beer-hall in Costa, I am not aware of the time that that was carried out. It could have been full of people.  There is no further details on that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well, let us leave that with a question mark.  Have a look at the others and tell us that before your assassination of Mr Hani, whether or not there was any violence against human life?</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> It is quite possible that there were acts of violence here against human rights which are not given in the detail, Mr Chairman.  I, without going through each one and without knowing the full details, I am not qualified to comment on that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> No, well, you see, if I were to suggest to you that in the main, these acts were symbolic acts of opposition to the, primarily to the National Party in which we do not know, except in one or two instances, whether they were intended that there should be loss of human life, but even in cases where there was human life lost, it appeared to be of an unfortunate result of the main act of actually attacking the property.  With one or two exceptions, would you agree with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> No, I do not agree with that, Mr Chairman.  In fact, it is not true to state that.  I am of, just while you are talking I have been going through this thing quickly and I pick up immediately on the 6th of July 1990, a bomb explodes at a taxi rank in Central Johannesburg.  I am sure that the Committee will agree with me that that has nothing to do with the National Party, number one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.  I said ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> It says further 27 people injured, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes, I, remember my words, in the main.  I will draw attention to the exceptions.  In the main ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> ... do you agree?</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> ... without going through each of these individual cases ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> ... and getting, having the full details, I am not qualified to reply to that question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> This was an annexure to your own application.  Did you not apply your mind when you annexed it in support of your application, what its meaning and effect was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, I took it at face value.</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And what is its face value that you took it at?</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Well, its face value is, Mr Chairman, that the right perpetrated many deeds of violence in which people were killed.  Deed number, 14th of July 1990, a hand grenade attack on a hotel in Roodepoort kills two men and injures 21.  There are many of those and it could be that those details are not included in the other reports as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> I see.  Now, do you know, once it was not the Conservative Party, do you know of any known political organisation that was responsible for any of these acts?</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, I was assured that the AWB had done research on this and they had found that these acts had been perpetrated by the right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> The question was, did anybody from the AWB tell you that these were acts committed with the authority of the Afrikaner Weerstand Beweeging?</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> They did not tell you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> No, they did not tell me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Very well.  Now, you annexed this and you are relying on it and you talk about the right, the rightwingers or whatever.  The question is that you are unable to tell the Committee whether any known political organisation or liberal, liberation movement or people in the employ of the security services were responsible for any of these acts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> That is correct, Mr Chairman, I took it at face value.</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Did you know when you did this application that there were people moving around in the 90's who were referred to as the "Brandy and Coke Brigades", people who sat around bars and got drunk and then went out and committed some act of violence or other supposedly in furtherance of some object or other.  Had you ever heard of those people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> No, I have not, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well, the Committee will hear about them in due course.  You, did you enquire as to whether the act where people were actually killed on the 9th of October, that a bus full of commuters is attacked outside Durban, six people are killed in the attack, which is in relation for an attack on White pedestrians in Durban the day before.</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> A retaliation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Retaliation by a group of, well let us first of  all.  Wanton acts of violence committed against White people on the one day and wanton acts of violence committed against Black people the next day on a bus.  That can hardly be on behalf of a political organisation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, I was personally aware of the circumstances regarding this specific case, because...</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> ... I was detained at maximum prison together with the three men who were sentenced to death for their part in this ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> ... attack and they assured me they were AWB and they were acting on behalf of the AWB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Is that what they told you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> That is what they told me, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> I see and you cannot tell us whether they were telling you the truth or not, of course?</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I have no idea, ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> .. Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And I am going to put to you that when you, Walus and we will submit together with others committed this there was no precedent of assassination of a top political leader in the country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, that is not correct.  I am aware of an assassination carried out by the ANC on a member of the KwaNdebele, sorry the Kangwane Government.</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well, you may have regarded him a high profile leader, but, well, let us, is that the example you followed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> That is the example that I ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Or was it an attack of revenge?</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> That is the example I followed, I am aware of, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> When was he killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I do not have the details, but I can provide them, because I have information regarding that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well, did you follow that example?</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I beg your pardon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Did you follow that example, is that it?  Is that a new reason why you tell us you killed Chris Hani, because ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> No, no that is ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> ... someone was killed in KwaNdebele?</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> That is not correct, Mr Chairman, I am just contradicting what Mr Bizos has said about no other...</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> I see.</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> ... leading people being assassinated and, also, Mr Chairman, I have testified in my testimony last week, that the ANC, themselves, were even planning to assassinate the whole National Party cabinet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Mr Derby-Lewis, I think this should be mentioned to you that if you are referring to the assassination of a former Cabinet Minister of KwaNdebele, Mr ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Kangwane.</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Kangwane.</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> ... Kangwane.</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I think it was Kangwane, but I know there was a Cabinet Minister of one of the self-governing territories.</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Maybe we should leave it there, because you are not sure which one.  I was going to, I thought you were possibly referring to KwaNdebele, but if you are not very sure then we should leave it there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> It could be that I am confused between the names of the two ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> ... territories, but I know that a Cabinet Minister was attacked and assassinated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> In relation to any ANC decision, was it not scotched by the leadership of the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> The plan itself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> The proposal, if there was one, was it not scotched by the leadership of the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> It was, Mr Chairman, but not on moral grounds.</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well, this was during the 80's, was it not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> That is correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> But you knew that they did not, well, that they scotched that particular plan.  Let us just leave it at that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> On, but not on moral grounds.</p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Oh, I see, yes.  You say that they had other grounds?  Very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> They say so themselves, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> And I think I testified to that ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> ... effect.  They say themselves that they were afraid that the struggle would then be taken in another direction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Nothing to do ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Because ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> ... with moral grounds.</p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Because, presumably, they were concerned that chaos and a race war should not come about as you intended.</p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I am not able to presume that on their behalf, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.  Did you anticipate that there would be a race war in the vacuum that was created with Mr Derby-Lewis', Mr, I beg your pardon, Mr Hani's assassination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> No, I did not, Mr Chairman, particularly, when one recalls that when one of our former Prime Ministers, Dr Hendrik Verwoerd, was assassinated, every Greek in the country did not pick up arms and start shooting Afrikaners or every Afrikaner did not pick up arms and start shooting every Greek in the country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> To the credit of the Afrikaner people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> But the fact remains that there was no idea of a potential race war, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.  What did you mean by chaos?</p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> General mayhem, Mr Chairman, and, obviously, ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> What is general mayhem?</p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> People killing one another, but Mr Chairman ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> I beg your pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> People killing one another, but ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> How many people did you expect to be killed for the purposes of the success of your objective?</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I was hoping that it would be kept to a minimum.  I think, Mr Chairman, it has been clear in our planning, that we wanted to avoid harming as many innocent people as possible and our hope was that it would happen quickly, there would be a minimum of casualties, but it would be obvious that there is total lack of control, because de Klerk would not act anyway and that the people would be, could then be motivated into filling the gap.</p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Mr Derby-Lewis, are chaos, mayhem and minimum synonyms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, I am not here on a language discussion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> I beg your pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I am not here on a language discussion, I am ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> I am sorry, I am not hearing, what sort of discussion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I am not here with, busy with a language discussion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Language is very important in communicating your thoughts and you used those three words in relation to your objective.  How could there be chaos and mayhem as your stated objectives in one hand and minimum number of people being killed on the other?</p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, the fact that we only targeted one person shows that our intention was to keep it down to a minimum.  We could have gone out and targeted a whole lot of people if we wanted to do what you are insinuating.</p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well, if that answer is correct, either you have not disclosed the real objective of creating chaos and mayhem or your objective failed.  Which of the two do you say was the case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, our objective was reached up until the time of the problems experienced at Bophuthatswana.  In fact, Mr Chairman, to my knowledge as well, there was not that much, in terms of deaths, during the aftermath of the late Chris Hani's assassination.  In fact, I have figures which I can provide for the Committee which are produced by the Human Rights Monitor which indicate, in fact, that there were more people killed the week before Mr Hani's assassination than during the week of his assassination.</p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Do you agree that the country was thrown into a crisis as a result of the assassination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I agree it was, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Did you agree or do you agree that not only did people die, but that the confidence in the future of the country was severely effected?</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, may I ask Mr Bizos from what document on record he is quoting so that ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> ... I can see the context in which statement was made.</p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> I am asking you whether, what your state of mind was and your information.  Do not worry about the documents I am looking at.</p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, I am aware of press reports, but I am also aware that certain people published these alarmist opinions when, in fact, there are other reasons which are causing certain lacks of confidence and so on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> You see, let me just read to you, as an example, once, you will not admit something unless I refer you to a document.  Business Day, Friday, April the 16th 1993 in R3, Section D, page 24.</p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Section D.  It is not in my bundle.</p>

<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I am so sorry.</p>

<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a>MR BIZOS:  "Business and consumer confidence had taken a near mortal blow since the assassination last Saturday of SACP leader, Chris Hani, economists said yesterday.  Econometrics economist, Tony Twine, said confidence had been edging up since the beginning of the year.  However, it had taken a dive since last weekend and it would plunge further if any of this weeks activities got out of hand.  We are only halfway through the minefield.  We need a clear demonstration that the authorities are in control and that rage and anger have cooled Twine said.".</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a>and then statements from Stellenbosch University, Mr de Klerk and everyone else and there are, there is a whole section, the whole of section D deals with the chaos that was caused and the attempts made by the Government and, particularly, the leadership of the ANC and the South African Communist Party to quieten people down, that you wanted to cause chaos and mayhem.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, as I have stated, and Mr Bizos has referred to this press report, it was one economist who made that statement.  His statement was semi-supported by somebody from the University of Stellenbosch, but then that same person made a strange statement, Mr Chairman.  He said further,</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a>"Until a new Government was in place and South Africans had a clear picture of the future, confidence would remain low.".</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a>That confirms the point I was making, Mr Chairman, that it is not these incidents that caused a big hiccup, it is a general situation and here, according to him, the situation was that people would not settle down until there was a new Government and it was not so much the Hani assassination.  Then the further statement here, the Durban Regional Chamber of Business, Mr Chairman, said nothing about business confidence, it said that, </p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a>"Rampages in Durban on Wednesday by ANC supporters were inexcusable.".</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a>Then, Mr Chairman, the Southern Natal ANC Alliance said,</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a>"Disciplinary steps would be taken against the unruly elements once they had been identified.".</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a>Nothing to do with business confidence and I am submitting, Mr Chairman, that always under situations like this journalists use people to exaggerate the situation and if you look at these other statements that Mr Bizos is referring to, Mr Chairman, there are a number of repeats.  I did a quick spot check to see whether information connected in one clipping was, perhaps, also repeated in another clipping and that is so, Mr Chairman, and this is not the only section that this has been done.  There are other sections where they have used up to six statements regarding the same incident to prove their point or to try to prove their point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Mr Derby-Lewis, you say that your act was a successful act until the setback at Bophuthatswana.</p>
<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> What I said, Mr Chairman, was what happened after confirmed that we were right in our assessment and that it would mobilise the Afrikaner leaders to act and to come together and to forget their differences and to try and stop the rot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And the intention was to create chaos and mayhem?</p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Which would result, which would cause that effect, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Therefore, it is not the journalists that are misinterpreting the situation, you yourself say you succeeded, you created chaos and mayhem?</p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, but I said the extent of the chaos, because we wanted the minimum of problems to take place, the extent of the chaos has been exaggerated by journalists.</p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> But you yourself say that it was a success and if the final success had come about at Bophuthatswana, then it would have been a 100% success.</p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I was referring to the reaction amongst right wing leaders, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Because it was, in that respect, a success.</p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Was the CP ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How, sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line546"><a name="pos546"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Was the CP involved in Bophuthatswana?</p>
<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Yes, they were, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line548"><a name="pos548"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Who, by who?</p>
<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> To the best of my knowledge, Dr Hartzenberg, himself was present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Oh, let us hear about that.  What role did Mr Hartzenberg play in the attempt to ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Prevent ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> ... use violence ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> To ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> ... against Bophuthatswana.</p>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> No, Mr Chairman, I did not say he was there to use violence against Bophuthatswana, I said he was there to prevent violence being perpetrated against Bophuthatswana.</p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> The Government of the day was the National Party.</p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> The Government of Bophuthatswana, Mr Chairman, was the Government under President Mangope.</p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> The Government of South Africa was under the control of the National Party?</p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> That is correct, Mr Chairman, but Bophuthatswana was an independent ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> ... state</p>
<p class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.  Let us work on the premise that you are working on, that it was, indeed, an independent state.</p>
<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> It is a constitutional fact, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes, let us even work on that premise.  I do not want to argue the situation on a political basis as to whether it was a legitimate state or not.  Let us work on your premise.  The South African Government and Mr Derby-Lewis is a South African, of course, I beg your pardon, Mr Hartzenberg, is a South African citizen and a political leader in South Africa not in Bophuthatswana?</p>
<p class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> That is correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line566"><a name="pos566"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Was an attempt made by certain sections of the community to buttress up Mr Mangope's regime and to take over in order to avoid the process that had started for a united South Africa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> That is correct, Mr Chairman, in Mr Bizos' ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line568"><a name="pos568"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Did Mr Hartzenberg take part in the events and was he in any way responsible for the shooting that there was done in Bophuthatswana during that attempt?</p>
<p class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, as I was not present on the ground, I am not qualified to comment on that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line570"><a name="pos570"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Was it policy of the Conservative Party to have heavily armed people in bakkies, on bakkies, on their motor cars to go in with arms and kill innocent people in Bambatha and in Mafekeng?  Did he make himself party to this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I testified earlier, Mr Chairman, that there was no written policy ever, from the CP's part, regarding violence, but that the status quo, the facts of the situation was different.</p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Was he party to any act which the Bophuthatswana army had to repel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I said, Mr Chairman, I am not aware of what happened on the ground ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> ... and I am not qualified to comment on that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> You see, have you been called a racist, Mr Derby-Lewis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Many times, Mr Chairman.  I have discovered that when liberals have no other criticism, they resort to this hoary old chestnut, because it is very difficult to dispute something like that, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.  Did you regret that an Air Zimbabwe pilot put his brakes on so hard as to brake, as to have a tyre burst in order to avoid a Black person on the runway at Jan Smuts Airport?</p>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I did not express regret over that,  Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well, we will prove what your statement was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> You think so, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.  Did you ever say that the solution to South Africa's problems was compulsory sterilisation of Black people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, it is interesting that Mr Bizos raises that point, because that whole issue was the subject of a court case where I sued the then member of Parliament for Krugersdorp for lying in a propaganda piece of his and the lie was contained in that very statement which I took, it was an allegation by a journalist, that I had made that statement and I took the matter, Mr Chairman, to the Media Council, because I could not, at that stage, afford legal representative otherwise I would have really taken more serious action.  I took the matter to the Media Council and at the Media Council, ruled in my favour that, in fact, I had not made that statement and when the journalist concerned was asked to produce the tape, because I insisted with journalists, because by that stage I had learnt what devious means these liberal journalists used to mislead the public, Mr Chairman, I insisted on the journalist concerned sitting there with a tape recorder to record every word we said.  Mr Chairman, when the Media Council called for the production of that tape, as is now the case, apparently, with these tapes here, they were untraceable and then the story came back from the Editor that it had been taped over.  Very conveniently taped over so that they could not produce the tape which would support what I had said, because I took that precaution.  So, what Mr Bizos is now propagating there, Mr Chairman, is a blatant lie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well, let us see, I do not want to give you too, to take up too much time on this.  You actually sued Mr Wessels and the Nationalist Party for calling you a racist?</p>
<p class="line" id="line585"><a name="pos585"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I sued Mr ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line586"><a name="pos586"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Just answer the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> No, not for calling me a racist.  I sued him for lying about me in a propaganda document.</p>
<p class="line" id="line588"><a name="pos588"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes, which said that you were a racist?</p>
<p class="line" id="line589"><a name="pos589"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Which said that I said that statement that you ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> ... produced.</p>
<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> I know about that case and I am going to put it to you and I will put it briefly and, I believe, accurately and just give me an opportunity so that we can get on with it.  You sued and they asked for absolution and absolution was granted.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line593"><a name="pos593"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> That is correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line594"><a name="pos594"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And they appealed and the court in the Transvaal said that absolution should not be granted, should not have been granted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> That is correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line596"><a name="pos596"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Which gave you an opportunity to set the matter down in plain damages against Mr Wessels and the National Party?</p>
<p class="line" id="line597"><a name="pos597"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> What Mr Bizos omits to mention, Mr Chairman, was that in the judgement by Judges Kriegler and Joffe, I think it was, they actually took an unprecedented step and they awarded interim costs in my favour because of the circumstances surrounding the case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line598"><a name="pos598"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line599"><a name="pos599"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> And it cost the National Party, in my estimation, something like R45 000,00 in those interim costs.  I had no costs, I had no money available, Mr Chairman, to once again go back to the process and to find myself in front of the same magistrate who had perpetrated that dastardly deed and I had no reason to expect, Mr Chairman, that I was going to receive justice from him again, because he had already perpetrated an open injustice.</p>
<p class="line" id="line600"><a name="pos600"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.  What you say about the costs may be correct, but what you omit to say is that the magistrate recused himself and that the case had to start over again, but you forgot about it and you gave up your action.</p>
<p class="line" id="line601"><a name="pos601"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> What I also omitted to say, Mr Chairman, was that the magistrate concerned was very shortly after that promoted to Regional Magistrate and he was a known member of the Broederbond operating in Krugersdorp and I believe it was due to his Broederbond connections that I was subjected to these disgraceful tactics.</p>
<p class="line" id="line602"><a name="pos602"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.  Mr Derby-Lewis, do you still believe in separate development?</p>
<p class="line" id="line603"><a name="pos603"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I do, Mr Chairman, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line604"><a name="pos604"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Does it follow that you do not accept a united South Africa with a common citizenship if you are a believer in separate development?</p>
<p class="line" id="line605"><a name="pos605"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, I do not believe that a united South Africa is the solution for what is a problem which was resolved elsewhere in the world through separate development.</p>
<p class="line" id="line606"><a name="pos606"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Do you not believe that the problems of the country can be solved with, in a united South Africa with a common citizenship?</p>
<p class="line" id="line607"><a name="pos607"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, it is not only that I do not believe it, but it is quite obvious to me, if one looks at what is happening in KwaZulu Natal, that it is a problem, it, and I do not think it will be resolved.  It is ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line608"><a name="pos608"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> So that as you are sitting there now you think that the war is still going on.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line609"><a name="pos609"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, I believe it is still going on and is there, in KwaZulu Natal certainly, and is there anything to prove me wrong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line610"><a name="pos610"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And that the attempts to have a united South Africa with a common citizenship, certainly, are not consistent with separate development that you believe in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line611"><a name="pos611"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> That is correct, Mr Chairman</p>
<p class="line" id="line612"><a name="pos612"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And if you have an opportunity, presumably, you will feel obliged, will you not, to try and change the preamble of the countries Constitution?</p>
<p class="line" id="line613"><a name="pos613"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, I believe that I have done my bit as far as the freedom struggle of my people is concerned.  I have been detained in prison for almost four and a half years, I have been able to see my grandchildren once in that time, because I did not want to subject them to the, sorry, Mr Chairman, there is somebody else talking on the line here, I cannot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line614"><a name="pos614"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I appeal again, please, do not make your comments whilst the witness is giving evidence.  We cannot hear properly what he is saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line615"><a name="pos615"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, as I was explaining, that in the four and a half years, approximately, that I have been detained I have had access to my grandchildren once, because I do not believe that the prison environment is a suitable environment for them to be exposed to.  I have been isolated from my friends and family.  I explained the problem with the visits which has only recently been remedied, Mr Chairman, and I, quite honestly, must say, in addition, that I really do not know what the peoples' reaction will be to what I have done.  I do not know, because I have not discussed it with them, because I think that it would be presumptuous of me in the first instance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line616"><a name="pos616"></a>	Mr Chairman, I have already, should my application be successful, I have already decided that I am going to confine myself to my family and my friends who have stood by me so loyally during this period and I think I owe them something.  Besides that, I owe it to myself.  I love my children, I love my grandchildren and that is one of the things that I regret about this whole situation and that is that I have not been able to effect this love.  I have even compensated with, sorry Mr Chairman, did you want to say something.</p>
<p class="line" id="line617"><a name="pos617"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I do not know whether this answer you are giving is an answer to the question, as to whether, as far as you are concerned, the war in which you considered yourself engaged, whether in your mind, that war is still carrying on, ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line618"><a name="pos618"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> But ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line619"><a name="pos619"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ... as far as you are concerned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line620"><a name="pos620"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I am trying to explain this, Mr Chairman, and ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line621"><a name="pos621"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, you have told us that you have been in prison ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line622"><a name="pos622"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line623"><a name="pos623"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ... and your personal difficulties while you were in prison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line624"><a name="pos624"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Right and ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line625"><a name="pos625"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now, that does not answer, pointedly, the question.  In your mind, are you committed to the ongoing war in which you were involved?</p>
<p class="line" id="line626"><a name="pos626"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, I am no longer committed to any arms struggle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line627"><a name="pos627"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That is all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line628"><a name="pos628"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> In fact, I must qualify that and say also, Mr Chairman, that I see a ray of sunshine in the present Constitution of this country which purports to uphold the self-determined, self-determination rights of peoples and I believe that that could be peacefully resolved and I am sure that my party is already discussing along those lines, but as far as I am concerned, the arms struggle is over and, as far as I am concerned, it would appear even that my political career is over, that I have no further purpose as far as my people are concerned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line629"><a name="pos629"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Mr Derby- ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line630"><a name="pos630"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Bizos, might this be a convenient stage to  take the adjournment?</p>

<p class="line" id="line656"><a name="pos656"></a><span class="speaker">CLIVE DERBY-LEWIS:</span> (Still under oath).</p>
<p class="line" id="line657"><a name="pos657"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Derby-Lewis, I want to turn to your acquisition of the gun which you handed over to Mr Walus in order that he may kill Chris Hani.  Firstly, let us start with your reason for acquiring this gun.  In your statements you have said that you acquired this gun primarily for self protection.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line658"><a name="pos658"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line659"><a name="pos659"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.  You also told us that you understood the Kimberley resolution as a call to collect arms so that if the de Klerk Government or any other Government prohibited people from acquiring firearms, there would be a stockpile available to the right for self-protection?</p>
<p class="line" id="line660"><a name="pos660"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I cannot recall that I said that that was decided at the actual congress, but this was common cause and there were already stories floating around that weapons ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line661"><a name="pos661"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> I see.</p>
<p class="line" id="line662"><a name="pos662"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> ... were going to be confiscated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line663"><a name="pos663"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Even before the August 1992 Kimberley Conference?</p>
<p class="line" id="line664"><a name="pos664"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I know that people have been talking about this for quite a while, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line665"><a name="pos665"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Before August 1992?</p>
<p class="line" id="line666"><a name="pos666"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> As far as I know as well, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line667"><a name="pos667"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> You set yourself up as one of the Voorbokke, so to speak, of doing something about the cause of the right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line668"><a name="pos668"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, nothing that I did was in terms of setting myself up as one of the Voorbokke.  I did it because I believed it to be necessary and part of, in terms of the climate which existed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line669"><a name="pos669"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well, I called you a Voorbok, because you were ahead even of Dr Ferdi Hartzenberg and other Conservative Party leaders.  You were, apparently, a person who just did not talk, but you made, took practical steps in order to further the cause?</p>
<p class="line" id="line670"><a name="pos670"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line671"><a name="pos671"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Right, now, how serious is, are you in giving evidence that this gun was acquired for that purpose and not for the purposes of assassination.  If it is the only gun that you obtained for this purpose of a period of at least nine months, from the time of the conference at Kimberley, and on your present evidence even longer, because you told us that they were stored even before.  One gun with a silencer for the purposes of arming the Volk.</p>
<p class="line" id="line672"><a name="pos672"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, if everyone participated, all I needed was one weapon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line673"><a name="pos673"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> But you already had two, Mr Derby-Lewis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line674"><a name="pos674"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> No, that is not correct, Mr Chairman, I only had one pistol.</p>
<p class="line" id="line675"><a name="pos675"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Only one pistol?</p>
<p class="line" id="line676"><a name="pos676"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line677"><a name="pos677"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Oh, and was this ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line678"><a name="pos678"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> And that was ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line679"><a name="pos679"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> ... acquired so that you could shoot with both hands?</p>
<p class="line" id="line680"><a name="pos680"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> That was a 38 revolver, Mr Chairman, and I, while I can appreciate something like that appealing to Mr Bizos, that was not anything to do with the intentions behind the acquiring of the weapon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line681"><a name="pos681"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.  Now, if you were serious about this mobilisation, surely you would have tried to do an arms stockpile for the benefit of the rights of the Volk?</p>
<p class="line" id="line682"><a name="pos682"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, my perception was that that was not necessary, that the Volk would do that side of it themselves and that my responsibility was to prepare them for that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line683"><a name="pos683"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And you were rather fortunate and in a better position in order to stockpile these arms, if your evidence is true, ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line684"><a name="pos684"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> That is not ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line685"><a name="pos685"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> ... because you have, you had ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line686"><a name="pos686"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Excuse me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line687"><a name="pos687"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> ... come across a person that had, apparently, a stockpile of arms which were stolen from the army, according to the evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line688"><a name="pos688"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I did not know that, Mr Chairman.  I did not know where he was going to get the weapons from and I did not ask him either.</p>
<p class="line" id="line689"><a name="pos689"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.  In relation to the reason and manner in which you acquired this gun, when was it agreed that you would get the gun for Mr Walus to do the shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line690"><a name="pos690"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> He asked me for the gun in the latter part of March, Mr Chairman.  Up to that stage I had thought he was going to use his own weapon, because I knew he had a weapon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line691"><a name="pos691"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And if anyone said that there was agreement between you about securing a gun at the end of 1992, would that be false?</p>
<p class="line" id="line692"><a name="pos692"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> That would be false, Mr Chairman, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line693"><a name="pos693"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Will you please turn to R4, page 51, paragraph 21.</p>
<p class="line" id="line694"><a name="pos694"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> What page number, Mr Bizos?</p>
<p class="line" id="line695"><a name="pos695"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Page 21, not 51, 21.</p>
<p class="line" id="line696"><a name="pos696"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> 21.</p>
<p class="line" id="line697"><a name="pos697"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> According to the notes made at the time, it would appear that, - I just want to get the correct - of your interrogation on the 20th of April, which appears on page 19, 93, it is noted that you said,</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line698"><a name="pos698"></a>"During the end of 1992, a decision was taken that Kuba would do the shooting and would be responsible for obtaining the firearm.".</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line699"><a name="pos699"></a>Were you correctly recorded there or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line700"><a name="pos700"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, this statement is totally devoid of any factual basis and, in fact, this statement to which Mr Bizos is referring is not in my words and I have called for the tape to try and compare this with what is on the tape and I have been told that the tape is not available, but, Mr Chairman, it must be clear and we, I am sure Mr Bizos will ask me out about certain other details here, that this could not have been correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line701"><a name="pos701"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> You say that you never said anything of the sort?</p>
<p class="line" id="line702"><a name="pos702"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> That is correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line703"><a name="pos703"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> You are not saying that you were in any way compelled to say something like this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line704"><a name="pos704"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, I am saying that I was under a general air of compulsion throughout my Section 29 interrogation, under a general air of compulsion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line705"><a name="pos705"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Please make up your mind, if you can, whether if you said this, you said it, because you were compelled to say something which was not true?</p>
<p class="line" id="line706"><a name="pos706"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, I said that I did not say that, I could not remember saying that and I wanted to check what had been on the tape in order to refresh my memory as this interrogation was taken under extremely adverse conditions, as it will be apparent from here, it was on the 20th at 04H45 after I had been in detention since the 17th of April with very little sleep and with a lot of discomfort and pressure and harassment, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line707"><a name="pos707"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> No, please try and answer the question directly.  Are you saying that you did not say it or that if you did say it, it was some form of compulsion that led you to say it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line708"><a name="pos708"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I am saying that I did not say it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line709"><a name="pos709"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> You did not say it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line710"><a name="pos710"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> And if I was and there was a possibility that I was compelled to say this, but I would not have made this statement in my right mind, because I knew that that statement was incorrect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line711"><a name="pos711"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think that, you know, you are a sufficiently experienced man to know the difference between making a statement under compulsion and not making a statement at all.  Now, either you made this statement or you did not make it.  There may be some statements which you may have made under compulsion with which you do not agree now.  Is this one of those, that you made a statement, but you disagree with it now or did you not make that statement at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line712"><a name="pos712"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, I could not have made this statement in my right mind, because it was not factual.</p>
<p class="line" id="line713"><a name="pos713"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> The section at the, Section 20 before, did you make that statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line714"><a name="pos714"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, this whole document is not in my words.</p>
<p class="line" id="line715"><a name="pos715"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Please ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line716"><a name="pos716"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I would not have made statements which appear here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line717"><a name="pos717"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Please tell us whether you said what is contained in the short paragraph 20, whether you said that or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line718"><a name="pos718"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I could have said that in, but not in this context, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line719"><a name="pos719"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> You could have said it, but?</p>
<p class="line" id="line720"><a name="pos720"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> In another context, at another, discussing something else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line721"><a name="pos721"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is this paragraph 22, Mr Bizos?</p>
<p class="line" id="line722"><a name="pos722"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> 20, We will come to 22, Mr Chairman.  What is the problem?  In what context other than that within the paragraph itself was it being said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line723"><a name="pos723"></a>MR PRINSLOO OBJECTS</p>
<p class="line" id="line724"><a name="pos724"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Mr Chairman, with respect, in as far as this statement is concerned, we have asked on numerous occasions for the tapes to be made available.  As is clearly, from reading this document, not in the words of the first person making a statement and up till now nobody produced those tapes, nobody has come forward to explain where they are and, secondly, Mr Chairman, this is not the original document.  We asked for the original document and so far it has not been produced.</p>
<p class="line" id="line725"><a name="pos725"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The Committee will bear that in mind when it decides on what value to give to all this evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line726"><a name="pos726"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Right.  With respect, Mr Chairman, the difficulty is how can the applicant refresh his memory from a document which is not in his words whereas there is a document, a tape available, which will reveal his precise words.  That is the objection we made from the instance of this particular enquiry, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line727"><a name="pos727"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> For once and for all, Mr Bizos, can we put to rest this whole question of what has happened to these tapes and why they are not made available.</p>
<p class="line" id="line728"><a name="pos728"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> We have not given answer to that, we did not have them,  Mr Chairman.  The Commission had them, the police officers had them, the Commission had it.  They say they handed everything over.  We did not have the tape.  I am entitled, with respect, in the absence of the tape, to lead the person who transcribed those tapes, that person may or may not be believed or the person that actually put this document together, whether this is what is said or not.  I am entitled to use the document at this stage and, as you indicated, Mr Chairman, the weight to be placed upon the document will depend up on what evidence follows.</p>
<p class="line" id="line729"><a name="pos729"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Who took ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line730"><a name="pos730"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mpshe, ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line731"><a name="pos731"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Who took this statement.  Is this Captain Deeltlief's one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line732"><a name="pos732"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That is correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line733"><a name="pos733"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> But I understood, Mr Bizos, that you said at the beginning of proceedings today that Captain Holmes was on the way here and he would be able to say what happened to the tape and could it stand over till then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line734"><a name="pos734"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line735"><a name="pos735"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Well, where is he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line736"><a name="pos736"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Mr Chairman, according to my, he is in the vicinity, Mr Chairman.  He says that everything that he had, he handed over, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line737"><a name="pos737"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, Mr Mpshe, can you tell us what has happened to these tapes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line738"><a name="pos738"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Mr Chairman, the tapes referred to are tapes number three and four and Captain Holmes indicated to me last week Thursday, that he was going to look for them and when he came back to me today he indicated that these tapes were used by a Mr Deetliefs and he is going to look for Mr Deetliefs to come and explain as to what happened to the tapes, as well as to explain the statement and he has not come back to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line739"><a name="pos739"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So, it is not correct that they are in the possession of the Commission?</p>
<p class="line" id="line740"><a name="pos740"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> It is not correct.  I have got a note which...</p>
<p class="line" id="line741"><a name="pos741"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, I understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line742"><a name="pos742"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> ... Sergeant Holmes wrote to me that he is going to look for them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line743"><a name="pos743"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Bizos, you are entitled to put your questions and you heard that these tapes are not being held back from you for some other purpose.  So, you either agree to the questions that are put to you or reserve your right to answer questions if you have some doubt about them.  Let us proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line744"><a name="pos744"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, I wish to reserve my right to answer any questions in connection with this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line745"><a name="pos745"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, maybe there are questions in certain paragraphs which might correctly reflect the position.</p>
<p class="line" id="line746"><a name="pos746"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, that will then be used to give credibility, possibly, to this document and I cannot, under those circumstances, answer.  I wish to reserve my right regarding answering any of these questions at this stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line747"><a name="pos747"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It is not a question of giving credibility to this document.  We are not concerned about this document, we are concerned about the evidence you are going to give as what you think is the right answer to the questions that are put.  That is all.  This document and its validity will depend upon how it was transcribed by whom and from what source, but until then questions are put fairly to you.  You can answer those questions or if you have no recollection of the details then you may so, but to say that I am not going to answer any questions arising from this document, that is not permissible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line748"><a name="pos748"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> One of the problems, as I see it, Mr Chairman, is that Mr Bizos has been putting these questions as does this correctly record what you say, but the point the witness has made is, it does not purport to record what he says.  This is a summary of what was said and I think, in fairness to the witness, it should be made clear he is not been asked to confirm the wording, but whether the context reflects what he said, not that it is something that he himself said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line749"><a name="pos749"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Very well.  Did you say to Captain Deetliefs that it was decided at the end of 1992 that Kuba would do the shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line750"><a name="pos750"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> No, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line751"><a name="pos751"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Right.  Did you say to the, to Captain Deetliefs that that was only decided at the end of March?</p>
<p class="line" id="line752"><a name="pos752"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line753"><a name="pos753"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Can you suggest any possible reason that Mr, Captain Deetliefs would have written "at the end of 1992" if you had told him that it was in March?</p>
<p class="line" id="line754"><a name="pos754"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I am not prepared to suggest anything in this ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line755"><a name="pos755"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> No comments.</p>
<p class="line" id="line756"><a name="pos756"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> ... connection, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line757"><a name="pos757"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Right.  Then can we go to paragraph 22,</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line758"><a name="pos758"></a>"A person, Faan Venter, as far as my knowledge goes, moved to Krugersdorp.".</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line759"><a name="pos759"></a>Is that right?  Did you say that or words to that effect?</p>
<p class="line" id="line760"><a name="pos760"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, I have already testified that it was a fact that Mr Venter moved to ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line761"><a name="pos761"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Is the answer yes,</p>
<p class="line" id="line762"><a name="pos762"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Krugersdorp on ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line763"><a name="pos763"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> You said words to that effect?</p>
<p class="line" id="line764"><a name="pos764"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> ... on other occasions.  I have said that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line765"><a name="pos765"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes, let us try and make progress by answering the questions directly, please.  "During 1992 or early January 1993 he, Faan Venter, contacted Lewis and went to see him at home.  He informed Lewis that he had moved to Krugersdorp and wished to become involved with the CP.".</p>
<p class="line" id="line766"><a name="pos766"></a>Did you say words to that effect?</p>
<p class="line" id="line767"><a name="pos767"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> No, Mr Chairman, this information in this paragraph is totally incorrect.  Mr Venter only moved to Krugersdorp sometime in February and contacted my wife late in February to tell him that he was in Krugersdorp.</p>
<p class="line" id="line768"><a name="pos768"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> So, you say that the time is wrong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line769"><a name="pos769"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I am saying this statement is not correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line770"><a name="pos770"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> The whole of it or is just the January 1993 that is incorrect?</p>
<p class="line" id="line771"><a name="pos771"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I am saying I do not know where Captain Deetliefs got this information from, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line772"><a name="pos772"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> You did not know that he came from Maritzburg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line773"><a name="pos773"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I did not know until he informed me in March when he came to see me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line774"><a name="pos774"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And is it correct that he came to you and told you that he wanted to be involved in the Conservative Party affairs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line775"><a name="pos775"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> That is not in this paragraph.</p>
<p class="line" id="line776"><a name="pos776"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> In paragraph 22.</p>
<p class="line" id="line777"><a name="pos777"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> The last sentence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line778"><a name="pos778"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Oh, "by die KP betrokke was".  When he saw me in March he did indicate that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line779"><a name="pos779"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> I see.  So, again, it is just the time that is wrong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line780"><a name="pos780"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, I think I have replied to the question...</p>
<p class="line" id="line781"><a name="pos781"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line782"><a name="pos782"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> ... sufficiently well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line783"><a name="pos783"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> "During February 1993, Lewis contacted Faan</p>

<p class="line" id="line795"><a name="pos795"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> ... I have already testified that Mr Venter visited me at home ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line796"><a name="pos796"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line797"><a name="pos797"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> ... during March.</p>
<p class="line" id="line798"><a name="pos798"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Thank you.  You say that he did visit you, but it was not in February, but you say that it was in March?</p>
<p class="line" id="line799"><a name="pos799"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Nor did I ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line800"><a name="pos800"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> He also says it was not as a result of a telephone call...</p>
<p class="line" id="line801"><a name="pos801"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line802"><a name="pos802"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> ... asking him to come and visit, Mr Bizos.  It is a big difference.</p>
<p class="line" id="line803"><a name="pos803"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line804"><a name="pos804"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Not as a result of a telephone call?</p>
<p class="line" id="line805"><a name="pos805"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> That is correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line806"><a name="pos806"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> So, did he, when he did come and visit you, did he not first telephone you ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line807"><a name="pos807"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line808"><a name="pos808"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> ... telephone him?  You did not telephone him and you did not, he did not telephone you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line809"><a name="pos809"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, I have already indicated that when he contacted my residence, he got hold of my wife.  My wife invited him over.  He came in March.</p>
<p class="line" id="line810"><a name="pos810"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Right.  Let us carry on.  Did you say words to the effect that,</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line811"><a name="pos811"></a>"Lewis had discussed with Venter where he, Lewis, could obtain a pistol"?</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line812"><a name="pos812"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, I have already testified that when he visited I jokingly requested, because I was not sure of him, I jokingly requested of him as to whether he knew where I could get a weapon and he indicated that he did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line813"><a name="pos813"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> "And the reason why Venter was specifically</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line814"><a name="pos814"></a>approached was because he was the most recent person who launched political activities in the area.".</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line815"><a name="pos815"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> That is rubbish, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line816"><a name="pos816"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well, could you please help me, because I have some difficulty in understanding precisely what it means.  What does it mean to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line817"><a name="pos817"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> This statement says clearly, Mr Chairman,</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line818"><a name="pos818"></a>"The reason why Venter specifically was approached was because he was the most recent person who launched political activities in the area.".</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line819"><a name="pos819"></a>This means nothing to me, Mr Chairman, and it is a lot of rubbish.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line820"><a name="pos820"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Do you not understand it, like me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line821"><a name="pos821"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, this is rubbish.  I have said, ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line822"><a name="pos822"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> So, ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line823"><a name="pos823"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> ... how many times do I have to say that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line824"><a name="pos824"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Let us get on, Mr Bizos.</p>
<p class="line" id="line825"><a name="pos825"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line826"><a name="pos826"></a>"Lewis was specifically asked for an unlicensed firearm."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line827"><a name="pos827"></a>When he came to me in March, I testified already, that is so, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line828"><a name="pos828"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> What reason did you have to believe that he was a person who was capable of supplying you with arms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line829"><a name="pos829"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I did not believe it, Mr Chairman.  As I said, I ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line830"><a name="pos830"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He said he cracked a joke.</p>
<p class="line" id="line831"><a name="pos831"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> ... I, out of the blue, I asked him that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line832"><a name="pos832"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Out of?</p>
<p class="line" id="line833"><a name="pos833"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Out of the blue, I jokingly asked him to see whether he perhaps was such a person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line834"><a name="pos834"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> For how long had you known him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line835"><a name="pos835"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, I had not seen him prior to this for some years.  I think something like four years.</p>
<p class="line" id="line836"><a name="pos836"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Despite that, you could trust him fully?</p>
<p class="line" id="line837"><a name="pos837"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, I have already stated that I was very cautious and that is why I put it like that, so that if he started getting serious I could say it was only a joke I made.</p>
<p class="line" id="line838"><a name="pos838"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> I am going to put to you that as in connection with the list, both you and your wife, are not telling the truth in relation to the circumstances of the purpose for which this gun was obtained.</p>
<p class="line" id="line839"><a name="pos839"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> That, Mr Chairman, is an untruth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line840"><a name="pos840"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> It is an untruth.  Let us just test that.  On page R, in pile R4, page 334.</p>
<p class="line" id="line841"><a name="pos841"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> First or second portion of R4, Mr Chairman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line842"><a name="pos842"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> R4, page 334.  It is the second.</p>

<blockquote class="line" id="line844"><a name="pos844"></a>"I took the firearm for the first time out after arriving from the Cape.  I think it was the Saturday, the 3rd of April, the Saturday before the 10th of April.  Let me just be sure.  I showed it to my wife.  She knew I was looking for weapons in case the Government should withdraw the licensed weapons.  She just looked and said that it was interesting.  I said to my wife that it was an unlicensed firearm.  Yes, I said here is an unlicensed firearm.  Here I have now made a start.".</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line845"><a name="pos845"></a>Did you say that to your wife?</p>
<p class="line" id="line846"><a name="pos846"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> No, Mr Chairman, I did not.  That is not correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line847"><a name="pos847"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> That is not correct.  You also give, gave evidence and you say how this gun was delivered to you on the, by innocent people on the pretence that it was a jersey or pullover.</p>
<p class="line" id="line848"><a name="pos848"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> That information was included in my application, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line849"><a name="pos849"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.  What does this gun weigh?</p>
<p class="line" id="line850"><a name="pos850"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I am not sure, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line851"><a name="pos851"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> More or less.  It is a fairly heavy firearm, is it not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line852"><a name="pos852"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> No, it is not, Mr Chairman, it was a pistol.  Something which one can carry in the hand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line853"><a name="pos853"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes, but there are light ones and there are heavy ones.  Which category did this one fall into?</p>
<p class="line" id="line854"><a name="pos854"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, as far as pistols are concerned, this was a 9mm pistol and did not weigh any more than other 9mm pistols that I know of, except, perhaps, for the pistol I have read about, and that is the Glock one which is constructed out of some composite material.</p>
<p class="line" id="line855"><a name="pos855"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> By all accounts, it could hardly be compared to the weight of a jersey?</p>
<p class="line" id="line856"><a name="pos856"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> It was nothing to do with the weight of a jersey, Mr Chairman.  The idea was that it had to be wrapped in a jersey.</p>
<p class="line" id="line857"><a name="pos857"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.  You see, I am going to suggest to you, for a number of reasons which may emerge in the evidence more fully later, that you and your wife did not implicate Mr Venter and you tell a highly improbable story of how he came to give you this gun without knowing for what purpose it was going to be used.</p>
<p class="line" id="line858"><a name="pos858"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, that testimony was delivered by Mr Venter when he was called as a witness to our trial and, in fact, it was on the basis of his testimony that the Judge President of the Witwatersrand decided to indemnify him from any prosecution.  So, I assume, he must have believed him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line859"><a name="pos859"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> If we may turn to the application of Mr Walus.  He says ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line860"><a name="pos860"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Sorry, what bundle, Mr Chairman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line861"><a name="pos861"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> It is at bundle A.</p>
<p class="line" id="line862"><a name="pos862"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Bundle A.</p>
<p class="line" id="line863"><a name="pos863"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> His application, paragraph, page seven, paragraph eight.</p>
<p class="line" id="line864"><a name="pos864"></a>    Yes, Chair, not number, it is the third last from the bottom, Mr Chairman.  We numbered ours for my easy identification, Mr Chairman.  You take the one line as a paragraph at the bottom of page seven and go back.  </p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line865"><a name="pos865"></a>"Like many others ...",</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line866"><a name="pos866"></a>on the right.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line867"><a name="pos867"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman, I have it.  Excuse me.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line868"><a name="pos868"></a>MR BIZOS:  "Like many others on the right, he discussed what would be done to stop the de Klerk handover and like many others he laboured, harboured at the time vague plans to halt the de Klerk handover.  Some of these discussions occurred with Mr Derby-Lewis and with others in the Conservative Party.".</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line869"><a name="pos869"></a>Now, were you aware of any discussions between Mr Derby-Lewis, between yourself - I beg your pardon - between Mr Walus and others in the Conservative Party?  I will repeat it for the sake of clarity.  Were you aware of any discussions between Mr Walus and with others in the Conservative Party?</p>
<p class="line" id="line870"><a name="pos870"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> No, I was not, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line871"><a name="pos871"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Did, do you remember saying that when you heard of the murder you thought that he may have been set up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line872"><a name="pos872"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Yes, I did say that, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line873"><a name="pos873"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Who did you think might have set him up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line874"><a name="pos874"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> That was a knee-jerk reaction, because I could not...</p>
<p class="line" id="line875"><a name="pos875"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> I beg your pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line876"><a name="pos876"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> It was a knee-jerk reaction on my behalf, Mr Chairman, because I could not believe what I was reading in the media.</p>
<p class="line" id="line877"><a name="pos877"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> But what went through your mind?  Who could possibly have set him up if your case is that he and you jointly decided to have Mr Hani killed?  Who could have set him up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line878"><a name="pos878"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I had no idea, Mr Chairman.  I only expressed that sentiment, because the circumstances surrounding his actions were very strange to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line879"><a name="pos879"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> But what was so strange when you and he had agreed that you, Hani should be killed?  What was strange and what was it that you gave an idea that he was set up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line880"><a name="pos880"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, when we were planning and discussing the whole matter, during the discussions certain security precautions were discussed.  I mean, Walus said he was going to recce Mr Hani's house and he was going to make sure that his car was not seen there too often with false number plates.  He was also considering whether he would camouflage himself, because he has a very prominently coloured hair and that would have made him very easily identifiable.  So, these were part of the details which he was mentioning to me as part of his planning and that is why, when I saw what happened, that he had not camouflaged his car and that he had not disguised himself and he went in in broad daylight, it was really strange to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line881"><a name="pos881"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> The circumstances that you mentioned would indicate to you that he did it not in accordance with a plan?</p>
<p class="line" id="line882"><a name="pos882"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Not in accordance with the indications that I had of the way ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line883"><a name="pos883"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> That you had in mind?</p>
<p class="line" id="line884"><a name="pos884"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> ... he was going to operate.  No, no, that he was going to operate.  He had</p>
<p class="line" id="line885"><a name="pos885"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> He was going to ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line886"><a name="pos886"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> ... carte blanche on the arrangements, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line887"><a name="pos887"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> But now, he may have been negligent in his conduct, but why should that have given you the idea that he was set up by anybody.</p>
<p class="line" id="line888"><a name="pos888"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, I could never believe that, with my knowledge of Mr Walus, that he would be negligent in his conduct, ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line889"><a name="pos889"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Because he is a ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line890"><a name="pos890"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> ... because ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line891"><a name="pos891"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Because he is a professional killer or because he had special qualities in relation to the performance of this act?</p>
<p class="line" id="line892"><a name="pos892"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> No, Mr Chairman, because it was totally out of character.</p>
<p class="line" id="line893"><a name="pos893"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> What portion of his character was it out of?</p>
<p class="line" id="line894"><a name="pos894"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> He was not a reckless sort of a person, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line895"><a name="pos895"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> He was not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line896"><a name="pos896"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> A reckless sort of a person and to me the whole thing ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line897"><a name="pos897"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> How did you know that he would not be reckless about an assassination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line898"><a name="pos898"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I did not know, Mr Chairman, but I still felt that that was strange as to what happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line899"><a name="pos899"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Did you, perhaps, ask him whether he had killed anybody before in order to satisfy yourself that he was a fit and proper person chosen to perform the act?</p>
<p class="line" id="line900"><a name="pos900"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> On no occasion, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line901"><a name="pos901"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Did you have confidence that he would do a professional job?</p>
<p class="line" id="line902"><a name="pos902"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, I identified him as a steady sort of a person and he was calm and he came across as being competent.</p>
<p class="line" id="line903"><a name="pos903"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Did you discuss with him whether he had had any military training?</p>
<p class="line" id="line904"><a name="pos904"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I did not, Mr Chairman, but I knew that he was involved with weapons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line905"><a name="pos905"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> He was involved?</p>
<p class="line" id="line906"><a name="pos906"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> With weapons.  That he had his own weapon and that people use to take their weapons to him on a plot which, I believe, the family owned outside Pretoria, where they actually use to test them and ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line907"><a name="pos907"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Which persons' weapons were tested on his brother's farm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line908"><a name="pos908"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I do not know, Mr Chairman, ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line909"><a name="pos909"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Where ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line910"><a name="pos910"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> ... but I knew that they were tested, because ...</p>

<p class="line" id="line912"><a name="pos912"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> ... he told me he had done these tests.</p>
<p class="line" id="line913"><a name="pos913"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> In what context did he tell you that he had tested other peoples' weapons at his brother's farm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line914"><a name="pos914"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, to the best of my knowledge, ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line915"><a name="pos915"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> I beg your pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line916"><a name="pos916"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> To the best of my knowledge, a very good friend of his testified to that effect in the trial.</p>
<p class="line" id="line917"><a name="pos917"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> No, I asked you what knowledge you had of his ability to carry out this important, to you, important task before he was chosen to commit the deed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line918"><a name="pos918"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I had no reason to doubt him, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line919"><a name="pos919"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Mr Bizos, sorry to interrupt you.  Mr Derby-Lewis, the, once you use the words "set up", does that not suggest involvement of other people beyond the two of you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line920"><a name="pos920"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I agree that it suggests that, Mr Chairman, but I had no knowledge of it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line921"><a name="pos921"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, it is an amazing term to use in the context of what has happened, is it not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line922"><a name="pos922"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, it was my immediate reaction upon hearing of the circumstances.</p>
<p class="line" id="line923"><a name="pos923"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> But on what basis, I think that was the question, to which I am not sure we got an answer.  It is one thing to say somebody acted negligently, but it is quite a different thing to suggest the possible involvement of other people, because inherent in the use of the words "set up", as I have already indicated to you, there is a suggestion of involvement by some other people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line924"><a name="pos924"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> That is correct, Mr Chairman, and I can assure you that on the right, we were almost paranoiac, eventually, in our suspicion of people, because of the extent to which the de Klerk regime had infiltrated the various right wing organisations and perpetrated all sorts of treachery from within those organisations.  So, that was, my immediate reaction was, yes, it must be a set up, he would not have done that the way he did it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line925"><a name="pos925"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> You, did you feel that somebody or some other people might have come to know about the plan or the plot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line926"><a name="pos926"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I did not know, Mr Chairman.  I did not know, but I...</p>
<p class="line" id="line927"><a name="pos927"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> No, I am asking, did you think that somebody could have come to know about that plan?</p>
<p class="line" id="line928"><a name="pos928"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> When I saw his ...</p>

<p class="line" id="line1074"><a name="pos1074"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Was, when you say that you and Walus discussed the gravity of the situation, was he one of the right wing people with whom you discussed the gravity of the situation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1075"><a name="pos1075"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> No, Mr Chairman, he was not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1076"><a name="pos1076"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Why not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1077"><a name="pos1077"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Because, Mr Chairman, he just was not there.  When Mr Walus used to come and visit me he use to specifically come and visit me to have a discussion with me, not with other people.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1082"><a name="pos1082"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well, please tell us what he said that it was, that he said in support of the Conservative Party.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1087"><a name="pos1087"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> I will accept that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1088"><a name="pos1088"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think it will be unrealistic to ask him to explain all that now, Mr Bizos.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1111"><a name="pos1111"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes, perhaps, I did not make it very clear.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1135"><a name="pos1135"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> That is correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1136"><a name="pos1136"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> He is the head of the Murder and Robbery Squad that investigated your case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1137"><a name="pos1137"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> That is correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1138"><a name="pos1138"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And you wrote that letter and posted it to Colonel Human?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1139"><a name="pos1139"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, I just want to correct one thing which may be misinterpreted here.  Mr Bizos has said that he was head of the investigation which investigated the murder case.  He was in his capacity as head of the Murder and Robbery Squad, but the investigation under Section 29 was carried out totally by members of the security branch.  There were never any members of the East Rand Murder and Robbery Squad involved in the investigation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1140"><a name="pos1140"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> He was the head of the Murder and Robbery Squad ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1141"><a name="pos1141"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1142"><a name="pos1142"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> ... that investigated whether you and your wife and Mr Walus were guilty of murder.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1143"><a name="pos1143"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> And out of whose care I was taken, Mr Chairman, when I was placed under Section 29 control.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1144"><a name="pos1144"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Now, it was to him that you wrote the letter and not to the uniformed branch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1145"><a name="pos1145"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, my knowledge of military protocol and uniform protocol indicates to me that when one writes a letter, one writes a letter to the senior officer involved at a specific station.  Colonel Roos, although it is not clear from here, Colonel Roos was actually a Lieutenant-Colonel, but is entitled to be referred to as Colonel, but the senior officer at the East Rand Murder and Robbery Squad is a Colonel, a full Colonel, namely Colonel Human and that is why I wrote to him, but, Mr Chairman, I want to say also, that I had very little to do with Colonel Human's team on the Murder and Robbery Squad.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1146"><a name="pos1146"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Let us deal with one matter at a time, Mr Derby-Lewis.  You said that you wrote that letter to Colonel Roos.  That evidence was incorrect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1147"><a name="pos1147"></a>MR PRINSLOO OBJECTS</p>
<p class="line" id="line1148"><a name="pos1148"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> In fact, Mr Chairman, it is not correct what Mr Bizos is putting.  He says he wrote to the officer in the uniform.  That is how I interpret the military procedure and he said Colonel Roos, he referred to Colonel Roos.  He is still saying that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1149"><a name="pos1149"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> There should be no doubt about he intended to write to, surely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1150"><a name="pos1150"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, I was directing my remarks...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1151"><a name="pos1151"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> To Colonel Roos.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1152"><a name="pos1152"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> ... to Colonel Roos, obviously.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1153"><a name="pos1153"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Why did you send it to Colonel Human, who received it, and in accordance with practice, put the stamp of his office there and when it was received and how it came to be with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1154"><a name="pos1154"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, I am not aware of the administrative arrangements, but it was addressed to him as the senior officer and it was...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1155"><a name="pos1155"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Addressed to whom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1156"><a name="pos1156"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> ... and, Mr Chairman, let me state categorically, that the comments that I have here are equally applicable to Colonel Human and his team.  They are equally applicable to them, but I was not under their care either when I was under Section 29.  I was under the care of the security branch in a completely different situation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1157"><a name="pos1157"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That is really not relevant as to where you were at the time.  You were trying to express your thoughts about what had happened while you were under the control ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1158"><a name="pos1158"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Specifically to Colonel Roos.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1159"><a name="pos1159"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ... of Colonel Roos or Colonel Human.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1160"><a name="pos1160"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> That is correct.  Yes, but I could not write to Colonel Roos, because he was not the Commanding Officer of the depot, Mr Chairman.  Courtesy demands ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1161"><a name="pos1161"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Was he not the commanding officer of the station?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1162"><a name="pos1162"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> He was the Commanding Officer of the station, yes Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1163"><a name="pos1163"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Just look at the stamp, where was he stationed?  Look at the back.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1167"><a name="pos1167"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Where is his office?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1168"><a name="pos1168"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> It does not say here, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1169"><a name="pos1169"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Was he the Station Commander in Benoni where you were held?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1170"><a name="pos1170"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> He was the head of the Benoni police operation, as I saw it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1171"><a name="pos1171"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Was his office in Benoni where you were held?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1172"><a name="pos1172"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> His office was in Benoni, yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1173"><a name="pos1173"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Subject to correction, the headquarters of the Murder and Robbery Squad, my memory, unfortunately I cannot check it with Mr ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1174"><a name="pos1174"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Holmes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1175"><a name="pos1175"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> ... Holmes who was here and, unfortunately, had to go away on an appointment, was in Brakpan and not in Benoni at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1176"><a name="pos1176"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Well, I was not aware of that, Mr Chairman, at any time and nor was I made aware of that.  I and, Mr Chairman, I was, Colonel Human has a very large office at the Benoni police structure and his office and the office of Lieutenant-Colonel Roos are in exactly the same building.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1177"><a name="pos1177"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Bizos, you can perhaps tell us, what is the significance of all this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1178"><a name="pos1178"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well, in order to rebut, Mr Chairman, the suggestion that the statements were freely and voluntarily made.  You were told, Mr Chairman, that a letter was, when the letter was produced that it was addressed to the uniform branch, Mr, Colonel Roos, who had nothing to do with the investigation of the case.  This letter shows that it was received by Colonel Human, who was the head of the Murder and Robbery Squad and had to do much, from the time of his arrest to the time of his conviction, with the investigation of the case.  That is the point, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1179"><a name="pos1179"></a>MR PRINSLOO OBJECTS</p>
<p class="line" id="line1180"><a name="pos1180"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Mr Chairman, it is also important to note that Colonel van Niekerk was in charge of the security branch and he was not attached to Benoni at all, or his team.  Colonel van Niekerk was responsible for the men under his control which detained the applicant in terms of Section 29 of the Act.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1181"><a name="pos1181"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, anyway, the significance of it all is something that, yes, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1182"><a name="pos1182"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> The only point we wanted to make was that when Colonel Roos was singled out as the person to whom it was sent, that the evidence was not correct.  That is the only point that I want to make.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1183"><a name="pos1183"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, now, you know, this case has taken such a lot of time and I would urge you to deal with points that are, you know, really of some significance to ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1184"><a name="pos1184"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> We will do that.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1206"><a name="pos1206"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> No, Mr Chairman, because I would not give it to him at 00H20 in the morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1207"><a name="pos1207"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Just past midnight, anyway.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1208"><a name="pos1208"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> No, definitely not, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1209"><a name="pos1209"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Anyway, did you have ample opportunity to write out your statement on the paper that was given to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1210"><a name="pos1210"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, during the interrogation and the writing of the statement, was a lot of discussion and debate regarding what should be included in the statement and what should not be included.  You will recall that I testified that at the beginning, Colonel van Niekerk said to me that I must write what they want me to write, because if they are not satisfied with the statement, they will not accept it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1211"><a name="pos1211"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.  Did you write the statement in your cell or in the presence of the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1212"><a name="pos1212"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> As far as I remember, Mr Chairman, it was in my cell.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1213"><a name="pos1213"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> In your cell and is this in your usual handwriting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1214"><a name="pos1214"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Well, it is a bit larger than my usual handwriting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1215"><a name="pos1215"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> I beg your pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1216"><a name="pos1216"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> It is a bit larger than my usual handwriting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1217"><a name="pos1217"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> A bit larger?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1218"><a name="pos1218"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1219"><a name="pos1219"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Oh, is that, you wrote it a lot more largely so that it can be more clearly read?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1220"><a name="pos1220"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I do not know, Mr Chairman, but it is larger.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1221"><a name="pos1221"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> I see.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1222"><a name="pos1222"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1223"><a name="pos1223"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> But, would you agree, as you look at it, that it looks to be a neat and legible handwriting without any, well, certainly, it does not look as if it was written by a man who was exhausted and did not know what he was writing?  Let us come directly to the point.  It does not look like a statement written by a person who has been ill-treated, who has, who is exhausted and who was under pressure to write it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1224"><a name="pos1224"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, I am not qualified to ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1225"><a name="pos1225"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Oh, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1226"><a name="pos1226"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> ... state how a statement looks made by somebody who is under duress and who, how a statement does not look.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1227"><a name="pos1227"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> If we have a look at ordinary writing of yours can we expect any material differences which would indicate to the Committee that you were under duress when you wrote this statement out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1228"><a name="pos1228"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Well, Mr Chairman, if you look at page three, excuse me, there are at least three scratchings out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1229"><a name="pos1229"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes, well, that is on one ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1230"><a name="pos1230"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> And ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1231"><a name="pos1231"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> ... page and I ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1232"><a name="pos1232"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> And ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1233"><a name="pos1233"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> ... think there may be one or two other pages where there are scratching outs.  Is that, ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1234"><a name="pos1234"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> That is ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1235"><a name="pos1235"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> ... you are saying that that does not happen with people who are comfortable, who have written a statement as long as this and there are a small number of alterations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1236"><a name="pos1236"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I am, you asked me if there is anything to indicate that this was under duress.  If I was taking my time I would not have made mistakes that needed to be scratched out, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1237"><a name="pos1237"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Oh, I see, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1238"><a name="pos1238"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> And altered and some even ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1239"><a name="pos1239"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1240"><a name="pos1240"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> ... accentuated to make it clearer on page ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1241"><a name="pos1241"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well, I put ...</p>

<p class="line" id="line1243"><a name="pos1243"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> ... to you what we are going to argue.  I want to give you an opportunity to deal with it and you have.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1244"><a name="pos1244"></a>MR PRINSLOO OBJECTS</p>
<p class="line" id="line1245"><a name="pos1245"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Mr Chairman, before my learned friend proceeds, I am referring to page 340, R4 continued, paragraph 40, statement of Captain Deetliefs, where he states,</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1246"><a name="pos1246"></a>"On Friday, 23 April 1993 during the course of the day, I visited Clive Derby-Lewis in his cell.  I handed over to him folio paper as requested on Tuesday 20 April.".</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1247"><a name="pos1247"></a>Not, it was not given to him on the 20th of April as put to the applicant by Mr Derby-Lewis.  It is incorrect, Mr Chairman.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1249"><a name="pos1249"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> By Mr Bizos, I beg your pardon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1250"><a name="pos1250"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> That is why, in fact, I queried when I started, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1251"><a name="pos1251"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> It may be, yes, but I will, I just want to get the date.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1253"><a name="pos1253"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> It is page 340, Mr Chairman, paragraph 40.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1254"><a name="pos1254"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Mr Chairman, we want to see the date.  Anyway, be that as it may, you say that you ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1255"><a name="pos1255"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> There is the 23rd of April at the beginning and end of the paragraph concerned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1256"><a name="pos1256"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> I beg your pardon.  I beg your pardon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1257"><a name="pos1257"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Paragraph 40 refers to the date at the beginning of that paragraph as being 23rd of April 1993.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1258"><a name="pos1258"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes, well, be that as it may, it, I appreciate that it is a point that has to be dealt with and we are indebted to our learned friends for drawing attention to it, but you had an opportunity to write the statement in the cell.  What I want to ask you is this, were the police interested in you signing the document purporting to be the truth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1259"><a name="pos1259"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> That was the agreement with, which ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1260"><a name="pos1260"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1261"><a name="pos1261"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> ... produced this statement, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1262"><a name="pos1262"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> That was the agreement, yes, and you say that you signed this and merely to indicate whether there were alterations on a page or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1263"><a name="pos1263"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> On this particular statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1264"><a name="pos1264"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1265"><a name="pos1265"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> That is correct, Mr Chairman, that was what Captain Deetliefs asked me to do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1266"><a name="pos1266"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> He asked you ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1267"><a name="pos1267"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> He said he did not want a signature, he did not want to, to commit, me to commit myself at this stage, I must just go through this, check that there are no mistakes or alterations and if there are, sign them and otherwise certify there are no alterations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1268"><a name="pos1268"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> I am going to put to you that you signed it, because you wanted to indicate that you agreed with the contents and in order that there may not be suggestions that you, that anything was altered in your statement, you added no alterations or alterations.  What would have been the value of a statement to Mr Deetliefs or to anyone else without you signing that you spoke the truth in it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1269"><a name="pos1269"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, I explained why this word, these words "no alterations" were included on every page.  If I had wanted to say "contents correct" I would have written exactly that, Mr Chairman, "contacts correct, "contents correct" and signed it.  Why would I talk about alterations if I was going to confirm the contents?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1270"><a name="pos1270"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> So, you actually are telling us that whoever received your statement was satisfied with a signature only certifying whether there were alterations or not ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1271"><a name="pos1271"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> That is ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1272"><a name="pos1272"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> ... on a particular page ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1273"><a name="pos1273"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> That is ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1274"><a name="pos1274"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> ... and was not interested whether you had told them the truth or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1275"><a name="pos1275"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> That is correct, Mr Chairman.  Why would I initial the alterations where they were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1276"><a name="pos1276"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well, I have put to you why you did it and I am going to put to you that this suggestion that they were not interested for you to certify by your signature that it was the truth, is an answer which is, borders on your having lost sight of reality, Mr Derby-Lewis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1277"><a name="pos1277"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, why then would they produce another nicely typed statement with a space for me to sign and then allow my attorney to come in, to ensure that the thing is signed as a confession before a magistrate, if they were happy with this one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1278"><a name="pos1278"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> The question is whether you purported to write the truth or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1279"><a name="pos1279"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> No, Mr Chairman, that is not the question.  The question was ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1280"><a name="pos1280"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> The question was ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1281"><a name="pos1281"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> ... regarding the validity of this statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1282"><a name="pos1282"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> I am asking you whether you purported to have written the truth in this statement or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1283"><a name="pos1283"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I explained, Mr Chairman, ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1284"><a name="pos1284"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Did you ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1285"><a name="pos1285"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> ... that I, Mr Chairman, I have already made a statement regarding this statement in its typed form wherein I stated that the circumstances around the list I included, because I wanted to protect my wife and the fact that the police accepted it as the final statement, is an indication that they were satisfied with that as well.  In fact, they, to me that confirmed that they did not really believe that my wife was involved and that is why they did not press the matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1286"><a name="pos1286"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Did you purport to write truth in this statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1287"><a name="pos1287"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I said I did, Mr Chairman, with that exception.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1288"><a name="pos1288"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Right.  You purported to right the truth with an exception, did you say?  What was that exception or exceptions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1289"><a name="pos1289"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I refer here to the typed version of this, Mr Chairman, ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1290"><a name="pos1290"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1291"><a name="pos1291"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> ... which is on page 65, regarding the list of names.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1292"><a name="pos1292"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1293"><a name="pos1293"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Paragraph 44.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1294"><a name="pos1294"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> You deliberately lied in your written statement, in your own handwriting in relation to that whilst you were being coerced by the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1295"><a name="pos1295"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I have already testified to that, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1296"><a name="pos1296"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Is that the correct summary of your testimony, yes or no?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1297"><a name="pos1297"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I have already testified as to what extent this is correct.  It, with the exception ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1298"><a name="pos1298"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Mr Derby-Lewis, ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1299"><a name="pos1299"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> ... of those paragraphs, ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1300"><a name="pos1300"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Mr Derby-Lewis, ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1301"><a name="pos1301"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, it is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1302"><a name="pos1302"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> ... I will have, with the permission of the Chairman of the Committee, an answer to my question.  Did you purport to tell the truth with certain exceptions and did you lie to the police despite the pressure that there was put on you?  What is the answer to that question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1303"><a name="pos1303"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Yes, I did in this instance, Mr Chairman, ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1304"><a name="pos1304"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1305"><a name="pos1305"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> ... yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1306"><a name="pos1306"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> If you managed to lie and held out with your untruths, how great was the pressure that, you say, was imposed on you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1307"><a name="pos1307"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, I want to also recall that this was not under oath that this was done.  That is the first point I want to make and I want to say, secondly, that at that stage the pressure was off.  At that stage the pressure was off, because we had already reached agreement on the contents of the statement. They had then said to me, here is the paper, go and sit down, ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1308"><a name="pos1308"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> So, ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1309"><a name="pos1309"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> ... Deetliefs testified to that effect, and go and sit down and write it out and we will get it before a magistrate and we will accept this statement as is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1310"><a name="pos1310"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> So that, and you said yes and you said yes, because at that stage there was no pressure anymore on you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1311"><a name="pos1311"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> At that stage, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1312"><a name="pos1312"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.  So, you accepted to sign a statement at a time when there was no longer any pressure?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1313"><a name="pos1313"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Yes, yes, that is correct, the pressure had been removed because of my acceptance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1314"><a name="pos1314"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.  Thank you Mr Derby-Lewis.  I do not think that I have to take that point any further.  Now, in relation to your detention, did you see your attorneys?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1315"><a name="pos1315"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> In relation to my detention?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1316"><a name="pos1316"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.  As soon as your detention, well, first of all, you saw your attorneys in order to oppose the application for the extension of the period of detention.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1317"><a name="pos1317"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Correct.  Excuse me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1318"><a name="pos1318"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Did you tell your attorneys, at that time, that you had been coerced to make any statements?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1319"><a name="pos1319"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman.  That is why my advocate, at the end of my detention period, got me to produce the statement which is part of the evidence.  I do not know what ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1320"><a name="pos1320"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> For how long did you see your attorney when you gave instructions to oppose the application to extend the period of detention?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1321"><a name="pos1321"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I am not sure, Mr Chairman.  I am not sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1322"><a name="pos1322"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> You knew that unlike the unfortunate detainees under Section 6 and under Section 29 in the pre-90 days, that your affidavit would go before a judge and that you would be represented by counsel and that you would be given a hearing as to whether your detention should be extended or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1323"><a name="pos1323"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> You mean when we tried to oppose the application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1324"><a name="pos1324"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1325"><a name="pos1325"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1326"><a name="pos1326"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> In the representations that you made to the court not to extend your Section 29 detention, did you say that you had been ill-treated whilst in the, whilst you were in detention?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1327"><a name="pos1327"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I cannot recall, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1328"><a name="pos1328"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Do you recall whether you complained to your attorneys, at that time, and say, look, here is an opportunity for you to put in the affidavit so that it may become publicly known that I have been ill-treated and, also, that I fear that if my detention is extended, I will suffer more from these, to use your wife's words outside these proceedings, by these torturers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1329"><a name="pos1329"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, at that stage, the pressure had been stopped.  So, there was no reason to complain about that.  The intention was to oppose the extension, because there was no reason for the extension.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1330"><a name="pos1330"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Mr Derby-Lewis, ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1331"><a name="pos1331"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The answer is no.  In that application before the court he did not mention there was pressure on him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1332"><a name="pos1332"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> That is correct, no, I said that, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1333"><a name="pos1333"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.  Bear with me for just a short while.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1334"><a name="pos1334"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> When did you make this statement, the 20th?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1335"><a name="pos1335"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Which one, Mr Chairman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1336"><a name="pos1336"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> The one we are talking about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1337"><a name="pos1337"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> The hand written one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1338"><a name="pos1338"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> The hand written one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1339"><a name="pos1339"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> No, Mr Chairman, apparently it was finalised on the 27th ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1340"><a name="pos1340"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> 27th.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1341"><a name="pos1341"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> ... of April.  It started, the pressure started on the 20th in terms of Section 29, the real pressure.  Until then I was even allowed to see my family that weekend and the impression was created that I was being taken care of and nobody had to worry about me and then on Monday morning, early, when nobody could do anything about it, that is when they sprung the Section 29 on me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1342"><a name="pos1342"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Do you agree that no complaint was voiced by your attorneys or counsel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1343"><a name="pos1343"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> As far as I know, there was no complaint at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1344"><a name="pos1344"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Even though the pressure started as soon as you were converted from a criminal procedure detainee to a Section 29 detainee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1345"><a name="pos1345"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, I do not know whether there was any relevance in terms of the further application, because at that stage the pressure was off.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1346"><a name="pos1346"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> When did the pressure start?  Let us just get that clear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1347"><a name="pos1347"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> The pressure started on the 17th of April when I was arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1348"><a name="pos1348"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes and, obviously, that was before you made, you saw your attorneys in order to oppose the extension?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1349"><a name="pos1349"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I beg your pardon.  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1350"><a name="pos1350"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1351"><a name="pos1351"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> That was my initial arrest.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1352"><a name="pos1352"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes, yes.  Now, I want to read to you a newspaper cutting which may or may not have come to your attention, published on the 2nd of May 1993.  This may have been whilst you and your wife, when was your wife arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1353"><a name="pos1353"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> On the 21st I think, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1354"><a name="pos1354"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> 21st, Yes.  So probably, ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1355"><a name="pos1355"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> The 23rd, no ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1356"><a name="pos1356"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> ... you were probably in detention at, on the 2nd of May 1993.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1357"><a name="pos1357"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I was, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1358"><a name="pos1358"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1359"><a name="pos1359"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1360"><a name="pos1360"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> I want you to comment on a statement made.  I will, we will hand in a copy, Mr Chairman.  It is headed,</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1361"><a name="pos1361"></a>"Was the overbearing Gaye Derby-Lewis playing Lady Macbeth to her ambitious husband.",</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1362"><a name="pos1362"></a>and I merely do that for the purposes of identification, but what I am concerned about is this,</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1363"><a name="pos1363"></a>"Her husband became a MP in 1987 forging a reputation in Parliament where even his CP colleagues strove to keep up with him to keep up civil appearances as an inveterate racist.

<blockquote class="line" id="line1364"><a name="pos1364"></a>"I think sometimes he became an embarrassment to us.  He was a complex, difficult character, very, very hard line.  He had a calling to bring English speakers to the CP, but his personal style actually put them off."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1365"><a name="pos1365"></a>		He lost his Parliamentary  seat in 1989, Whites only election, at which point he decided, without abandoning his role as a self-appointed leader of the English speaking South African ultra-right to consolidate friendships elsewhere.  One of these friends was David Irving, the controversial British historian, famous for his Hitler sympathies.".</p>
<p class="line" id="line1366"><a name="pos1366"></a>Now, I do not want, I do not expect you to admit this, but who was Mr Beyers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1367"><a name="pos1367"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, Mr Beyers was a man who had been, who left the party at that stage.  He was a man who had an axe to grind with me, because I saw through him long before anyone else in the CP in terms of what he was using the Conservative Party for his own personal affairs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1368"><a name="pos1368"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1369"><a name="pos1369"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> That is what he was.  He was a, as far as I was concerned, he was an outcast and he still is.  He is a member, he is actually, Mr Chairman, he is an elected member of the National Party now.  He has jumped from the National Party to the HNP to the CP to the Afrikaner Volks Unie and from there he has gone back to the National Party.  So, I think that gives an indication of the integrity of the man.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1370"><a name="pos1370"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> He was the ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1371"><a name="pos1371"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Excuse me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1372"><a name="pos1372"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> ... Secretary of the Conservative Party from when to when?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1373"><a name="pos1373"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I am not sure of the exact dates, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1374"><a name="pos1374"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Try and be of assistance to us, please.  Was it during the period that you were a Member of Parliament?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1375"><a name="pos1375"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Yes, it was, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1376"><a name="pos1376"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And was he the Secretary of the Conservative Party whilst you were in the ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1377"><a name="pos1377"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> President's Council.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1378"><a name="pos1378"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> ... in the President's Council?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1379"><a name="pos1379"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Not for all of the time, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1380"><a name="pos1380"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Not all the time, but some of the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1381"><a name="pos1381"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Possibly, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1382"><a name="pos1382"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1383"><a name="pos1383"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I am not sure exactly when he ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1384"><a name="pos1384"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Now, ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1385"><a name="pos1385"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> No, it was, definitely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1386"><a name="pos1386"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> ... according to the statement, he had a low opinion of you and you, apparently, share that about him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1387"><a name="pos1387"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> That is correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1388"><a name="pos1388"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> The Committee is not interested in the rights and wrongs of that situation, Mr Derby-Lewis, but you yourself must also have made your views, if not generally known, at least the relationship between you, at best was, cold and correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1389"><a name="pos1389"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Fragile.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1390"><a name="pos1390"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Fragile and cold and correct, to use diplomatic terms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1391"><a name="pos1391"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> That is debatable, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1392"><a name="pos1392"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.  Now, he was the General Secretary of a political party, is the next most important person in the party after the leader, is he not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1393"><a name="pos1393"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Not in the Conservative Party, no, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1394"><a name="pos1394"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well, is he the third most important person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1395"><a name="pos1395"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, he is responsible for party organisation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1396"><a name="pos1396"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes, well, let us see in the hierarchy.  There is the leader, there is the deputy-leader and then, presumably, the Treasurer or the Secretary between the two of them, they must be high up in the hierarchy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1397"><a name="pos1397"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> That is not correct, Mr Chairman.  I think Mr Bizos must familiarise himself about the CP.  The CP was, in fact, a very democratic party and the party was not controlled in a dictatorial manner similar to the National Party.  We learnt our lessons from them and that is not the structure that you are describing...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1398"><a name="pos1398"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> ... and I will read the portion out, Mr Derby-Lewis, and ask you.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1399"><a name="pos1399"></a>"When the decision was made to bar my entourage from entering the Krugersdorp Centenary Hall, it was made because they were Black.  The Conservative Party had taken action against Blacks using the facilities of towns which the CP controls.  Blacks, because they are Black, that we are talking about.  Mr Derby-Lewis plays with words, hypocritically.  Having the right to place conditions on the use of the City Hall is one thing.  Nobody disputes that the City Council has the right to do so in the sense that it commands the decision-making machinery which can make such decision.  Were I a White, I and my entourage would not even have to receive City Council permission to be in the City Hall.  It is sheer naked racism which is applied against us.  I want to assure Mr Derby-Lewis that when we in KwaZulu could possibly be facing conditions on visits to this region, they will not be decided on with any regard whatsoever being paid to race.".</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1400"><a name="pos1400"></a>Now, what do you say about this allegation by Mr Buthulezi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1401"><a name="pos1401"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, Mr Bizos has not even given us an indication of the date of that article, regardless of not giving us a copy.  Could he please tell me when that article appeared.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1402"><a name="pos1402"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> I think, with respect to myself, that I did say it was the 3rd of May 1989, but I will not take umbrage at it, but you have heard what it was, what was said, if this is what was said, what do you say about it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1403"><a name="pos1403"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, if I missed the date and Mr Bizos said it, I apologise.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1404"><a name="pos1404"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1405"><a name="pos1405"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I did not hear it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1406"><a name="pos1406"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1407"><a name="pos1407"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> But as far as that report is concerned, Mr Chairman, it was not my decision to prevent Dr Buthulezi's entourage from taking over the hall mentioned in terms of that article.  As far as my memory serves me, and this is now going back something like eight years, Mr Chairman, as far as my memory serves me, it was the Town Council of Krugersdorp that took that decision and, also, once again relying on my memory, Mr Chairman, I believe that the decision was taken because the Council involved felt affronted by Dr Buthulezi that he believed that he could come to a council building in Krugersdorp and that the council, itself, would not be able to look after his security.  I think that was the basis for that report.  Now, Mr Chairman, there is a lot of stuff which Mr Bizos read out there.  Can you just please repeat the part that you want...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1408"><a name="pos1408"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well, you have dealt with the one allegation.  The other allegation I will summarise for you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1409"><a name="pos1409"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1410"><a name="pos1410"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Was that your Conservative Party prevented Black people from making use of council facilities.  Was that true or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1411"><a name="pos1411"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, those were the laws at the time.  They were only acting in conformity with the laws.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1412"><a name="pos1412"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> In the towns in which the Conservative Party had a majority, Blacks could not use the library.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1413"><a name="pos1413"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, in, to the best of my knowledge, in a lot of councils where the CP did not have even a representative, the same situation prevailed.  I do not know why Mr Bizos is singling out the Conservative Party for this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1414"><a name="pos1414"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> No, I am talking about the Conservative Party that did not allow people to go into the town library.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1415"><a name="pos1415"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> That is correct, Mr Chairman.  So did the National Party, so did other political parties.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1416"><a name="pos1416"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> I do not know whether that was so, but even if it was, let us just deal with the Conservative Party today.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1417"><a name="pos1417"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Bizos, I thought you were setting out to show that Mr Derby-Lewis was a racialist?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1418"><a name="pos1418"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1419"><a name="pos1419"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now you are pointing the fact that it is the Conservative Party that was racialist.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1420"><a name="pos1420"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes, well ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1421"><a name="pos1421"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Could you not just confine your ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1422"><a name="pos1422"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> To ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1423"><a name="pos1423"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ... criticism to Mr Derby-Lewis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1424"><a name="pos1424"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes, I will do that, Mr Chairman.  This will go in as another exhibit.  It will be ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1425"><a name="pos1425"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> EXHIBIT R13.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1426"><a name="pos1426"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> R13.  Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1427"><a name="pos1427"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Have you changed the number of the letter from R11 to R12, because I have changed the number on your R11 to R12.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1428"><a name="pos1428"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> As it pleases.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1429"><a name="pos1429"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1430"><a name="pos1430"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> To put it in proper context.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1431"><a name="pos1431"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Mr Chairman, the actual ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1432"><a name="pos1432"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Yes, sorry, Mr Chairman, before, I have just been handed a copy of R12.  May I just obtain the Committee's opinion on this.  I have been told that while I am under cross-examination, I am not allowed to consult with anybody regarding the matters on which I am being cross-examined.  Now, Mr Chairman, this document I did not draw up and I will need to consult somebody to find out the exact detail of the background of this letter.  Am I entitled to do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1433"><a name="pos1433"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Which document are you talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1434"><a name="pos1434"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I am talking about R12, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1435"><a name="pos1435"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That was the document that was obtained from your wife's computer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1436"><a name="pos1436"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> That is correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1437"><a name="pos1437"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  Well, now, I do not think you have denied that it came from your wife's computer, have you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1438"><a name="pos1438"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> This does not come from my wife's computer, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1439"><a name="pos1439"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Oh.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1440"><a name="pos1440"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> It is obviously not a computer produced, in fact, it looks to me like a typewriter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1441"><a name="pos1441"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1442"><a name="pos1442"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> So, I, it is, unless I may be wrong, it may be the printer that was used to produce this, produces another typeface, but this is not the typeface of my wife or my own computer which is produced by the printer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1443"><a name="pos1443"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1444"><a name="pos1444"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I know, I am aware of the printer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1445"><a name="pos1445"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> May I ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1446"><a name="pos1446"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> That is why.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1447"><a name="pos1447"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> May I suggest, Mr Chairman, that before he is re-examined, I am sure that his counsel can ask Mrs Derby-Lewis where it comes from or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1448"><a name="pos1448"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1449"><a name="pos1449"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you in a position to say, Mr Bizos, whether that document comes from the computer or whether it was a document typed by somebody in the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1450"><a name="pos1450"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> We were told that it was printed out of Mrs Derby-Lewis' computer.  This is what we were told.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1451"><a name="pos1451"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Well, now, you will have an opportunity to deal with this ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1452"><a name="pos1452"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1453"><a name="pos1453"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ... and consult with your counsel once the cross-examination is over.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1454"><a name="pos1454"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Did the handwritten bit also come out of the computer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1455"><a name="pos1455"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1456"><a name="pos1456"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Which handwritten portion, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1457"><a name="pos1457"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> "Not such a good friend".</p>
<p class="line" id="line1458"><a name="pos1458"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Let me just clarify the position.  The computer was taken away and there was a hard drive.  It comes out of the hard drive found in Mrs Derby-Lewis' computer and printed on the Police printer.  No, that is my handwriting, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1459"><a name="pos1459"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Oh, so you are writing comments on documents that you are handing in as exhibits.  I do not think you should, Mr Bizos.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1460"><a name="pos1460"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> It was the only copy that I had, Mr Chairman.  I apologise.  Please ignore my, the marginal note that I made.  Had I noticed it, I would have scratched it out, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1461"><a name="pos1461"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, with respect, may I just make one comment regarding this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1462"><a name="pos1462"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1463"><a name="pos1463"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I must express my surprise that the SAP are still in possession of documents which belong to my wife after she was found not guilty of any crime by the Supreme Court of the Witwatersrand, and I query the motives and if this is part of the continued pressuring of us, Mr Chairman, then I want to express my strongest disapproval of this.  I do not think this is acceptable behaviour.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1464"><a name="pos1464"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, I think it is a matter that can be raised with the authorities and that is the police from whose files this document has been obtained.  That is a matter between you or your wife, rather, and the police.  She is entitled to demand everything that belongs to her which they have taken away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1465"><a name="pos1465"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1466"><a name="pos1466"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  Can we proceed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1467"><a name="pos1467"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1468"><a name="pos1468"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Sorry, Mr Chairman, I am still waiting to see the statement that Mr Bizos is using regarding Dr Buthulezi or is that finished now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1469"><a name="pos1469"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> That is finished.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1470"><a name="pos1470"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1471"><a name="pos1471"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> It is being copied and you will get a copy and if you want to say anything about it in re-examination you will have ample opportunity.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1472"><a name="pos1472"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Okay, Mr Chairman, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1473"><a name="pos1473"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> You, have you had an opportunity of looking at R5, which is the statement of Mr Jerome Cronin with annexures?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1474"><a name="pos1474"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, I must state that I received it together with R4, but I have not had an opportunity to have a look at it, because I have been, obviously, been involved with more pressing matters and I believed that the time for that would come when the time arrives for witnesses to be cross-examined and I could then prepare myself at the stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1475"><a name="pos1475"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well, what I want to put to you in general terms is this, that this statement has annexures attached to it of public statements made by Mr Chris Hani at various functions from 1991 to shortly before his death and what I want to put to you is that this public record of Mr Hani's utterances are completely in conflict with the picture that you and the applicant, the first applicant tried to paint of Mr Hani.  Did you bother, from 1991 to 1993, to read or inform yourself what the position of Mr Hani was in relation to the future of South Africa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1476"><a name="pos1476"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, the perception that I had of Mr Hani I obtained from the media which I, with which I am familiar.  I do not know whether that documentation contains references from them or whether it is other documentation, because I have not perused the document, but ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1477"><a name="pos1477"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well, ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1478"><a name="pos1478"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> ... my perception of ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1479"><a name="pos1479"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well, let me tell you that they were statements made on public platforms, on a radio programme, statements at CODESA and elsewhere which were given the widest publicity.  Did it come to your notice or did you close your eyes and ears ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1480"><a name="pos1480"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1481"><a name="pos1481"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> ... to everything that the person that you decided to murder had been saying for the last three years, the last three years of his life?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1482"><a name="pos1482"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, I think that people are familiar with the basic Communist technique and that is repeat a lie often enough and it becomes the truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1483"><a name="pos1483"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I do not think that is the, you are required to make a comment on that.  That is a matter for argument.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1484"><a name="pos1484"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1485"><a name="pos1485"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you read these reports that appeared from time to time which reflected the thinking of Mr Hani from between 1990 to 1993?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1486"><a name="pos1486"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I am not sure, Mr Chairman, because I am not sure which reports is, Mr Bizos is referring to, but I can say that I noticed reports about Mr Hani.  I mentioned in testimony that I had based my decision to target Mr Hani after a press report in February which reported that Mr Hani was agitating to obtain weaponry back from Angola into South Africa.  So I was aware of some, but I do not, I cannot give a blanket statement and say I was aware of everything, Mr Chairman, and ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1487"><a name="pos1487"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well, ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1488"><a name="pos1488"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> ... and certainly, I have never heard Mr Hani on a radio programme nor have I watched him on television.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1489"><a name="pos1489"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> It is a pity that you did not take an opportunity, even now, to read them even though you had about ten days, but in any event, do I understand your answer that whatever Mr Hani may have said, you would have dismissed as unimportant.  You had your own ideas about Mr Hani?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1490"><a name="pos1490"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> No, I did not say that, Mr Chairman.  I said I ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1491"><a name="pos1491"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> What did you say, Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1492"><a name="pos1492"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I said that I had read some reports on Mr Hani and that I did not believe that the reports that I had read of this man of peace were truthful.  I have also been told, Mr Chairman, for example, that he was a practising Christian at the time of his death and, yet, I am aware of a report, I do not, I am not sure whether it was on a radio programme or a TV programme where Mr Hani was being interviewed and I was advised that he stated categorically during that interview that he did not believe in God.  So, I think you can understand my difficulty, Mr Chairman, what is said and what is done are conflicting poles of one another and so ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1493"><a name="pos1493"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> You did not care what he said and you did not try and weigh up what he was saying over this period of three years before deciding whether he was the anti-Christ that you had to kill.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1494"><a name="pos1494"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, it, I believe I am correct in saying that it was the general perception amongst people on the right that Mr Hani and his Communist Party were only interested in one thing and that was the attainment of power, not democracy, the attainment of power, and that they would do everything in their power to achieve that end.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1495"><a name="pos1495"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> The "everything" was that the majority of the people of South Africa would vote for them into office?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1496"><a name="pos1496"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, I am convinced that had the Communist Party stood in the election, that would not have been the case.  The Communist Party and the Communist members rode in on the back of the populist African National Congress whom they knew had the support they required to attain power.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1497"><a name="pos1497"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Do you trust the judgement of the people of South Africa over yours sometimes, Mr Derby-Lewis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1498"><a name="pos1498"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, each person is entitled to his own opinion.  I too am entitled to an opinion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1499"><a name="pos1499"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Mr Derby-Lewis, you did not bother to find out anything about Mr Chris Hani's attitude during this period.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1500"><a name="pos1500"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Chairman, there was - sorry, I thought you had finished.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1501"><a name="pos1501"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> I am going to ask the Committee's permission to show something recorded a few days before his death for you, for the Committee and you to see.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1502"><a name="pos1502"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1503"><a name="pos1503"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> On the 6th of, it was on the 6th of April 1993, Mr Chairman.  MR DERBY-LEWIS:  Sorry, Mr Chairman, can Mr Bizos just repeat that date?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1504"><a name="pos1504"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> The 6th of April.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1505"><a name="pos1505"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> 6th of April 1993, thank you.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1507"><a name="pos1507"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I see they had no problem showing Dr Hartzenberg from a similar angle.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1512"><a name="pos1512"></a>		PRESENTER:  Chris Hani said the recent violence in Natal and the PWV region was cause for concern.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1515"><a name="pos1515"></a>RECORDING ENDED</p>
<p class="line" id="line1516"><a name="pos1516"></a>MR BIZOS:  You saw, did you, Mr Derby-Lewis, the late Mr Hani calling for peace and for the success of the negotiations?  That is the man that you killed, Mr Derby-Lewis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1517"><a name="pos1517"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1518"><a name="pos1518"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Mr Derby-Lewis, you made an attempt to apologise, firstly, in your statement where you actually apologise to the people on your side and the trouble that you gave them by your arrest.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1519"><a name="pos1519"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Yes, that is correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1520"><a name="pos1520"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> No apology for the killing of Mr Hani?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1521"><a name="pos1521"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> No, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1522"><a name="pos1522"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> In the absence of Mrs Hani, you took the opportunity of not even checking whether she was present or not and you purported to apologise to her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1523"><a name="pos1523"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, up until the time that I made my statement, I was aware that Mrs Hani was in the audience.  I had no information that she had left and I really believed that she was present, because I wanted to speak to her anyway.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1524"><a name="pos1524"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And then you, when you saw that she was here, you said certain words purporting to be an apology to her.  Have you apologised about wasting a valuable life that may have made a valuable contribution to the people of South Africa, Mr Derby-Lewis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1525"><a name="pos1525"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, with respect, may I ask is this a condition and is this something over which the Committee should then be subjected to evidence?  My impression was that an apology was not necessary and not part of the whole function of this Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1526"><a name="pos1526"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, Mr Bizos, the Act does not require an applicant to apologise for what he did.  He is required to make a full disclosure of what he did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1527"><a name="pos1527"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> I am not unmindful.  The question was not for the purposes, but in order to test his sincerity on the supposed apologies to Mrs Hani, Mr Chairman.  It is not only, I am not asking as a question of law.  I am asking as to whether this person that is before you has ever expressed regret for killing a person who could have made a valuable contribution to the political life of this country or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1528"><a name="pos1528"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, no.  How can I ever apologise for an act of war.  War is war.  I have not heard the ANC apologising, the perpetrators of these deeds for apologising for killing people in pubs and blowing them up in Wimpy Bars.  I have heard no apologies for that, Mr Chairman.  Those people are just as important as Mr Hani was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1529"><a name="pos1529"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> We are dealing with your case today and let us confine ourselves ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1530"><a name="pos1530"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1532"><a name="pos1532"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Anyway, the upshot of it all is that as far as Mr Derby-Lewis is concerned, he regarded what he did as an act of war and that ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1533"><a name="pos1533"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And he does ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1534"><a name="pos1534"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ... and there was no need for him to apologise.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1535"><a name="pos1535"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1536"><a name="pos1536"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Let us move on from there, Mr Bizos.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1537"><a name="pos1537"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, may I also state that my apology to Mrs Hani and her children was done in an attempt to reach out a hand of reconciliation to her which I hoped, very sincerely, that she would have taken.  That was my intention, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1538"><a name="pos1538"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1539"><a name="pos1539"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> And I can understand the anger of these people and I do not criticise them for that, Mr Chairman.  I understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1540"><a name="pos1540"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> You killed a person as an act of war who, four days before his death, was calling among a multitude of people, for peace, Mr Derby-Lewis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1541"><a name="pos1541"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, he called among a multitude of his people.  He did not phone me up and say, listen, I am going to make this speech.  He did not phone, he did not advise Dr Hartzenberg as one of the leaders or Dr Treurnicht as one of the leaders that he was a man of peace.  I want, Mr Chairman, I am quite sure that senior members of the CP will confirm that at no time did Mr Hani ever bring his intentions, excuse me, his intentions to the attention of the Conservative Party or the right.  So, how would we know about that, Mr Chairman, unless we watched the TV programmes, which I have already said, I have not watched.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1542"><a name="pos1542"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> You were invited to CODESA and you refused not to go.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1544"><a name="pos1544"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> How can you put the blame on Mr Hani ...</p>

<p class="line" id="line1546"><a name="pos1546"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> ... for not taking part in the political process and then say that you killed him because you did not know that he was calling for peace?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1547"><a name="pos1547"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> May I reply, Mr Chairman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1548"><a name="pos1548"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think your party's attitude towards CODESA is a matter on which you have already given evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1549"><a name="pos1549"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> It is on record, Mr Chairman, ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1550"><a name="pos1550"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1551"><a name="pos1551"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> ... that we refused to participate, because it was to do with the betrayal and sell-out of our people and the loss of our country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1552"><a name="pos1552"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1553"><a name="pos1553"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> "The amnesty process is for the purpose of</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1554"><a name="pos1554"></a>achieving reconciliation".</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1555"><a name="pos1555"></a>Mr Derby-Lewis.  You have already told us that you do not believe in the united South Africa, you do not believe in common citizenship and you are not prepared to apologise for killing a man who was calling for peace four days before his death.  Is that a fair summary of your evidence, Mr Derby-Lewis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1556"><a name="pos1556"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> No, Mr Chairman.  What Mr Bizos is doing now is he is selectively quoting out of the new Constitution which was not in existence at the time of Mr Hani's assassination and which also says that I am entitled to freedom of political expression or is there, am I misunderstanding this whole document?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1557"><a name="pos1557"></a>	Please, Mr Chairman, let me place on record that I think that, that Constitution is a good Constitution when one considers what the objective of the Constitution is.  I can see much to praise in that Constitution, but the fact remains, Mr Chairman, that nothing can convince me that my peoples' right to self-determination is wrong.  I cannot accept that, Mr Chairman, and if I said I was sorry, I would actually be admitting that, and I would then become worse than just a liar.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1558"><a name="pos1558"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And if the vast majority of the people of South Africa have decided that we are going to be a united country and not a fragmented country, which you call self-determination, and you are free, will you take steps to render inoperative the words of the preamble of the Constitution, Mr Derby-Lewis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1559"><a name="pos1559"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, the Constitution is a reality and it is quite correct, as Mr Bizos says, that the majority of the people have indicated their approval of that and how can I then want to force my will on those people over their own affairs.  They are perfectly entitled to that, Mr Chairman.  But surely, Mr Chairman, if one looks at world history, surely, Mr Chairman, if, even if one looks at South African history, recent and in the long term, it is clear, for example, that when the British compelled the Afrikaner to come into the Union of South Africa, we know the history of that, it was written into the Constitution at the time, categorically, that the Union of South Africa was the land of White South Africans.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1560"><a name="pos1560"></a>	And, Mr Chairman, in the process of drawing up that Constitution and doing what they did with the boundaries of the country and remembering that certain trust lands were not part of, part and parcel of the Union of South Africa, they were recognised as belonging to the various peoples who were still located within the boundaries.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1561"><a name="pos1561"></a>	And considering, Mr Chairman, that the British Government established Lesotho as the independent territory for the South Sotho people and considering that the Swazis got the territory of Swaziland and that the Tswanas were accorded Bophuthatswana, Mr Chairman, I do not think it was unreasonable at that time, I do not think it was unreasonable at that time for White South Africa also to be accorded a territory and I think that in the interests of peace and reconciliation, that was done.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1562"><a name="pos1562"></a>	Mr Chairman, we in the Conservative Party, have always questioned, we've always questioned, Mr Chairman, whether the people who were allowed to vote in 1994 were actually entitled to vote in view of the perfidy of the total political dishonesty perpetrated by Mr de Klerk whom, as I testified, was aware of the fact in 1990 already, that he no longer represented the people that he entered into negotiations on behalf of, and he was using the military and the SAP to protect his position in spite of the fact that he broke a mandate.  We had a rotten Constitution at the time.  We were not able, in terms of our Constitution, to take Mr de Klerk to court.  Otherwise I can assure you, Mr Chairman, had that possibility been contained in the Constitution at that time, Mr F W de Klerk would have been impeached for what he did, because he, by his own admission, betrayed the mandate given to him by the voter.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1563"><a name="pos1563"></a>	So, that is the background, Mr Chairman, and I think that makes it clear how I feel on that and why I still believe that we Afrikaners are entitled to a territory of our own where we can exercise self-determination over our own affairs in Southern Africa, wherever it may be.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1564"><a name="pos1564"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Having listened to you, Mr Derby-Lewis, can I summarise it by saying that you do not accept the legitimacy of the present Government?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1571"><a name="pos1571"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1572"><a name="pos1572"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> The long speech that you made did not sound as coming from a person who told the Committee that he has given up politics.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1573"><a name="pos1573"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, I have this knowledge.  Am I now expected to withhold this from the Committee, because I am leaving the political arena?  Mr Bizos invited those, that reply that I gave him.  He actually looked for it and I gave it to him, Mr Chairman.  Now he criticises me and tries to use that as the basis for a statement that I am going to, not going to leave politics.  If I sound like a politician, Mr Chairman, I am sorry.  I am a man of my people and that is all that I have ever tried to be and I have already assured this Committee that my plans are to now enjoy some of my life, because I have been involved solely in politics and everyone knows that, Mr Chairman, and that is why people outside are saying that this is the classical example of a political crime, because those people who know me, Mr Chairman, my opponents included, know that I would have no other motivation to perpetrate something as bad as that ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1574"><a name="pos1574"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1575"><a name="pos1575"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> ... for me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1576"><a name="pos1576"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Mr Derby-Lewis, I am going to put to you that you are not a representative of the Afrikaner people.  The vast majority of Afrikaners disassociate themselves from you altogether.  Would you accept that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1577"><a name="pos1577"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, I would challenge Mr Bizos to use his good offices with President Mandela and to invite a referendum on the question from him.  I think he would be very surprised at the outcome.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1578"><a name="pos1578"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> You have tried, on a number of occasions, to make a, to make personal references to me.  I have ignored them all, I will ignore this one as well, Mr Derby-Lewis.  Just answer my questions please.  Did the vast majority of the Afrikaners vote, despite your parties call not to vote?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1579"><a name="pos1579"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> That is debatable, Mr Chairman.  It depends on how you interpret the election result.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1580"><a name="pos1580"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1581"><a name="pos1581"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I, ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1582"><a name="pos1582"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well, ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1583"><a name="pos1583"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> My interpretation, Mr Chairman ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1584"><a name="pos1584"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> You do not accept it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1585"><a name="pos1585"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I do not accept that the vast majority of the Afrikaners ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1586"><a name="pos1586"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1587"><a name="pos1587"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> ... voted in favour of ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1588"><a name="pos1588"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1589"><a name="pos1589"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> ... participation, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1590"><a name="pos1590"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes, and, Mr Derby-Lewis, the time has come for me to put to you what we will submit to the Committee you did and why we will argue you did it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1591"><a name="pos1591"></a>	Firstly, you did it, because you have a sense of self-importance which is not justified by the facts.  That you had no authority from any political party, liberation movement or organ of State to commit the murder that you committed.  Do you agree with me so far?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1592"><a name="pos1592"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, I am not prepared to comment on this, because these statements are so ridiculous that they do not deserve comment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1593"><a name="pos1593"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well, you say no comment.  Very well, we, I can carry on.  Secondly, ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1594"><a name="pos1594"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Thirdly, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1595"><a name="pos1595"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Thirdly, thank you, ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1596"><a name="pos1596"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Yes, pleasure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1597"><a name="pos1597"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> That you did not act alone with Mr Walus and that you acted together with your wife and a number of people, including those who or those who reconnoitred the houses of the people on the list, supplied you with a gun and a silencer and, probably, others that neither you nor Mr  Walus chose to disclose.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1598"><a name="pos1598"></a>	That your act is completely out of proportion to any harm done to you or to anyone else and that you committed this murder when you saw that your racist policies had no chance of success, because the country was about to enter into a historical settlement in which racism would play no part.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1599"><a name="pos1599"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You are telling him that that is what you will submit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1600"><a name="pos1600"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> This is what - do you want to make any comment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1601"><a name="pos1601"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Mr Chairman, may I consult with my advocate?  I think that then indicates the end of the cross-examination.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1602"><a name="pos1602"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Have you made all the points that you were going to submit, Mr Bizos?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1603"><a name="pos1603"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes, in broad outline, Mr Chairman,  we have done that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1604"><a name="pos1604"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Very well.  Well, we will leave it at that, because I do not regard that as a question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1605"><a name="pos1605"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> If he wants to comment on it, Mr Chairman.  I did not want to take anyone by surprise.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1606"><a name="pos1606"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, anyway.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1607"><a name="pos1607"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1608"><a name="pos1608"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> These are the submissions that are going to be made and you are afforded an opportunity, if you wish, to comment on them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1609"><a name="pos1609"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I just want to say that I have already commented on the first two, Mr Chairman, and my comment applies similarly, equally to the other two.  It is nonsense.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1610"><a name="pos1610"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1611"><a name="pos1611"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Finally, that you have failed to bring yourself within Section 22 and 3 of the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act number 34 of 1955.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1612"><a name="pos1612"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> Sorry, Mr Chairman, would I, I was under the impression Mr Bizos had ended.  Would you please repeat that ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1613"><a name="pos1613"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> I am just making a legal submission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1614"><a name="pos1614"></a><span class="speaker">MR DERBY-LEWIS:</span> I just want the section's numbers please, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1615"><a name="pos1615"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes, 20, sub-section two and three of the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation.  Mr Chairman, that is all I want to put to this witness at this stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1616"><a name="pos1616"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1617"><a name="pos1617"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> I may indicate, Mr Chairman, that information is being filtered through to us as a result of these proceedings and as it looks as if we will not be finishing it this session, I will ask for leave in order to put further specific allegations to the witness once the information in confirmed, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1618"><a name="pos1618"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Which may or may not happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1619"><a name="pos1619"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Which may or may not happen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1620"><a name="pos1620"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1621"><a name="pos1621"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR BIZOS</p>
<p class="line" id="line1622"><a name="pos1622"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mpshe, are there questions you wish to put to this witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1623"><a name="pos1623"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Mr Chairman, I am not in a position to put questions at this stage, Mr Chairman.  I had questions and some of them may have been covered by Advocate Bizos, but I will need time to check whether what I am going to ask has already been covered by him.  So much has been said, I cannot commence right now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1624"><a name="pos1624"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, it is most unlikely that anything has been left for anybody else to ask.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1625"><a name="pos1625"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Mr Chairman, I want to believe that he may have done everything, but I want to satisfy myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1626"><a name="pos1626"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He may have asked more than he ought to have as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1627"><a name="pos1627"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Sorry, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1628"><a name="pos1628"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He may have asked more than he ought to have.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1629"><a name="pos1629"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman, he may have done so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1630"><a name="pos1630"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That is not intended to be a criticism of you, Mr Bizos.  It is just a compliment to your enthusiasm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1631"><a name="pos1631"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> I am not embarrassed by your statement, Mr Chairman.  I, you have given me a patient hearing for which I want to thank you and the members of the Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1632"><a name="pos1632"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mrs van der Walt, are there any questions you wish to put?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1633"><a name="pos1633"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> There are no questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1634"><a name="pos1634"></a>NO CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS VAN DER WALT</p>
<p class="line" id="line1635"><a name="pos1635"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Mr Prinsloo, do you wish to re-examine your witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1636"><a name="pos1636"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I would like to re-examine the witness, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1637"><a name="pos1637"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, please do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1638"><a name="pos1638"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Am I to understand that Mr Mpshe is not going to cross-examine the witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1639"><a name="pos1639"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, it is not likely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1640"><a name="pos1640"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Not likely?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1641"><a name="pos1641"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Not likely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1642"><a name="pos1642"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I think to cross-examine then, obviously, I...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1643"><a name="pos1643"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If he cross-examines I will give you another chance arising out of whatever happens.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1644"><a name="pos1644"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Mr Chairman, at this stage, may I ask the Committee's indulgence for me to go through all these questions, there is a number, but at the end it may only be a few questions that I will have to put to the witness.  It will save time if the Committee will grant me that indulgence.  Also, to clear up the documents that Mr Bizos put to the witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1645"><a name="pos1645"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> There has undoubtedly been extensive questioning of Mr Derby-Lewis, there has undoubtedly been reference to a large number of documents and I am satisfied that you are entitled to some time to consider the position before you re-examine your witness.  I am going to afford you the opportunity to consider your position before you re-examine Mr Derby-Lewis.  Mr Bizos ...(intervention)</p>
