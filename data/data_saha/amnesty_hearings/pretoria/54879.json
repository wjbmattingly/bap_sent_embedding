            "Chairperson, on the 14th January 1965 I joined the police, I was 16 years old.  After  a year's training at the Police College  I was placed at a station.  I performed  service in the charge  office.  I was too young to perform any other service, I was not allowed to carry a firearm.  In 1967 I was transferred to Springs uniform branch, where after a while I applied to be placed on the patrol dog\ncourse.  The application was granted and I was transferred to Pretoria Dog Unit and I started the course.  It was a four month course and before completion of this course, one afternoon I was called to the office and told that I had to report to Safety Headquarters the next morning for border service.  \n\tThe next morning I went by car with my patrol dog to the Botswana border.  At that stage  the whole border operation was aimed at combatting of terrorism and it was controlled by the Security Branch in Pretoria under the  leadership of Colonel Jan Harmse. \n\tDuring this period I met black members of the Security Branch.  We lived in an old  farmhouse on the border.  Our task was to patrol the area and to inform the people living in the area of possible attack  by terrorists from across the border.  Often during our patrols we were fired at.  It was reported to Colonel Harmse and he suggested that we should keep it quiet because we did not want to sow panic amongst people living in the area as well as the general public. \n\tAfter four and a half months I returned to my station, Springs,  where I was in control of a unit aimed at the arrest of Black people who had committed passbook contraventions.  My team and I, consisting of about 14 Black police officers, regularly performed raids.  (Inaudible) contraventions.  After about five months my patrol dog died as a result of conditions of extreme heat at the border and I was transferred to Murder and Robbery.  Here I really experienced violence.  We often had to witness scenes where people had been killed, there were armed robberies and I really had to deal with violence at first-hand.  This was round about 1968.  Whilst I was performing service in this unit, I also experienced certain techniques of interrogation which included various forms of coercion and torture.  During this period I worked very long hours, I was very seldom at home, in order to combat crime.  I was married at this stage and my wife could not tolerate the situation any longer and we were divorced.  \n\tAfter about eight years I tendered my resignation to the South African Police.  I was approached by the Rennies Group to work for them as an investigator at Fidelity  Guards.  I reported to them.  I was given the post and under  the command of Captain Dreyer I performed my duties. We were a small staff, about four to five persons and they were all ex-policemen.  After a while in Johannesburg, I was transferred as regional head of  Safety and Security for Natal Province.  \n\tI implemented and installed new  systems for the company, we had various branches throughout Natal, and when I was satisfied that the systems were up and running I decided to leave and joined  Price Forbes, a broking company as part of their Risk Management Team.  During this period we performed security analyses for big clients throughout South Africa, such as for instance Sasol I in 1980 where we pointed out various serious loopholes in their systems.  A  complete report was drafted and was handed to top management in an effort to try and rectify these loopholes and gaps and to implement the necessary measures in this regard to reduce the risk.\n\tDuring the time we worked at Sasol top management's fear was a terrorist attack on their premises.  I also visited sugar mills throughout  Natal where I performed similar analyses  and the general fear was terrorism there as well.  During this period I was also a founding member of the Institute of Criminology under the Professorship of Jakob van der Westhuizen and I was also a member of the Institute for Strategic Studies under Professor Mike Hough and Dr Wim Booysen.\n\tAfter about a year at Price Forbes I was approached by Fidelity Guards once again to return to them and I was appointed as a Group Security Manager for the Republic with my headquarters being in Johannesburg. \n\tDuring this period there were numerous  armed attacks on bank vehicles, armoured vehicles, in which the criminal element was clearly discernible.  These  were organised  attacks.  During this time guards were disarmed, without killing them, and cash removed  from the vehicles.  During this time we also got a contract to (inaudible - microphone not activated) right throughout the country .... our guards had to undergo a training programme organised  by the Defence Force.  I was involved with the taking of fingerprints and the sending of fingerprints and the processing of these prints to the South African Criminal Bureau, after which we received SAP69s in order to make the  selection process very strict. \n\tIn the early eighties, roundabout 1983-84 I through  sources  at my disposal going back to  police  days I learnt from informers that we could expect an attack from liberation organisations busy infiltrating the country.  It was clear that some of these robberies had been performed in a disciplined manner where AK47s were also used. \n\tAt that stage it was well-known that AK47s were  not available in South Africa, but that terrorist groups infiltrated the country with these arms in their possession.   This was before the trade in arms across the border really took off. \n\tIn this period, 1987, I went to Durban to do an investigation there and one evening, just in  front of the hotel where I was staying, round about six o'clock in the evening, I was attacked by four black men as I got out of my car.   They hit me with a blunt instrument through the face, it crushed my nose, my cheekbone,  fortunately I had my briefcase with me and I used that to ward  off the attack.  I was armed but unfortunately my firearm was in the briefcase but I am sure the black men didn't know that.  An eye-witness later told me that he saw four black men in a Mazda with a Transvaal registration number leaving the scene and that these men had on the previous day made investigations and enquiries at the hotel to ask whether I had arrived.",

            "No firearms were used.  My car was parked in such a way that all four could not reach me as I opened the door, Chairperson, and I think that saved me from further  attack.  I immediately had to go back to Johannesburg for an emergency operation.   My sources later told me that men from PAC and APLA living in Pretoria had received instructions to tail me and to kill me by  setting my car on fire.  At this stage I realised that the attack was not only against Fidelity Guards but also against the rest of the country and that these attacks were increasing in intensity.  Prior statistics showed this.  Banks were constantly under fire and robberies took place on a daily basis.\n\tI was in constant contact with the Security Branch and  members of Murder and Robbery Unit and we exchanged information.  I  recruited more sources and informers and I also learnt of a PAC Askari in custody,  he  was serving a sentence at Diepkloof Prison,  Julius Xhosa.  He worked for Soweto Security when this unfortunate incident took place and he was sentenced to imprisonment with the option of a fine.   During this period I also learnt from Brig Daantjie  van Wyk.  He had overall command of the special units at police headquarters in Pretoria.   He approached  me and  asked me whether I could not organise a position for him at Fidelity Guards.   He was very close to retirement.  I discussed  this with my director and it was approved and Brig van Wyk took my place and I  returned to the investigation unit and I was in overall command there. \n\tI discussed the Julius Xhosa incident with Brig Van Wyk  and I told him that it would be a good thing to recruit Julius Xhosa and we decided to pay his fine and to get him out of prison.  I had long discussions with Julius Xhosa and he was prepared to act as an informer within the company.  It was clear to me that  he was very afraid that his identity would be revealed.  But at that stage all our sources, all our sources which we were using, were terribly afraid, they were afraid of intimidation and in fact of being killed, of murder.  Julius Xhosa was a source of very valuable information for me and I shared this information with my colleagues at John Vorster Plein and various security branches and I was in  contact with security people throughout the country at very high level. \n\tAt one stage information was passed on to us that one of our big branches in Johannesburg would be robbed.  An ANC in a senior position at this branch was allegedly involved in an armed robbery of R245 000 during which people were\nkilled.  I decided to disconnect this person's telephone, he lived in Tembisa, and with the help of members of Murder and Robbery on the East Rand we disconnected his phone one night and we decided to install a microphone in his office so that  we could monitor all his telephone calls.  We observed this  particular branch for six months.  This was the branch which was identified as the next target for the armed robbery.  I delivered a brand new bakkie to the informer for  his use to infiltrate these people.  During this period  my  colleague, Johan van Eck, joined us in 1988.  I knew him well and his father well.  At that stage he was a  General at Headquarters.  General Van Eck was also my District Commandant at Murder and Robbery previously - he was also my rugby coach.\n\tWith his informers as well as mine and the rest of my staff, consisting of former security policemen, our main objective was to protect the firm and to exchange information with security branches.   I was also approached at one stage by police headquarters.  I am sorry, I am confusing the issue a little bit.

I was informed of a serious armed robbery which had taken place involving about eight armed men who had entered the premises, shot some of the guards and robbed a considerable amount of money.  I immediately  left for Hillbrow and when I arrived there I noticed there was total chaos.  (Inaudible - microphone not activated)  We immediately launched  an investigation and a search.  The vehicle was spotted behind the Ponti Building, a very high block of (inaudible).\n\tI immediately noticed that there had to  have been a very serious shooting incident.  Inside the vehicle there were lots of AK47 shells inside the vehicle and also outside the  doors which were open.  The money,  R4 1/2   million, all the money was found in the vehicle as well as firearms.   \n\tI returned to the scene of the  crime and we started investigating the area.  We wanted to ascertain how access had been gained to the premises.  I found a big carrier bag amongst the vehicles.  In the bag I found green uniforms similar to the ones worn by the guards.  I found more firearms.",

            "MR GERBER",
            "On the  scene of the crime, on the premises.  There  were also two hand grenades of Chinese origin  in the bag.  I immediately realised that it was impossible to gain access to the premises, especially by eight  people, it was impossible for eight people to just walk into the premises without anybody having noticed them and to commit such a robbery without any suspicion being raised.\n\tMy  suspicions were confirmed by our sources.  The attack which we had feared had  taken place.  I had talks with the Security Branch personnel, Major Deetlefs from John Vorster,  and I was also told at a later stage by Brig  Frik du Toit, Regional Commander of the Safety Branch, John Vorster Square, that APLA had brought in two cases of Chinese hand grenades.  At this stage the assault was not only aimed at Fidelity Guards but also at banks.  It was very clear that these attackers were (inaudible) for a cause, and they were also looking for firearms.  It was not only  confirmed by my own sources, but also by the Security Branch and members of Murder and Robbery.\n\tDuring May 1991 one evening round about ten o'clock I received a telephone call from an unknown black person.  He did not want to identify himself, but I recognised his voice.  He told me that if I went to the Fidelity Guards branch in Hillbrow the next morning at five o'clock, I would find the deceased, Samuel Ranaka, there busy negotiating with members of the PAC.  That morning quarter to five I was in the basement area where he was performing his duties. The  office  was also in the same building on the first floor.  I gained access through the front gate and went down to the basement by means of the fire exit.  I did not find Ranaka there, but a different guard who was performing his duties.  I noticed that the Incident Book that the handwriting in the  Incident Book had changed and that a page had been torn out of this register.  Whilst I was speaking to the guard, I heard somebody running down the steps.  It was the deceased clad in a type of karate uniform.   He was out of breath and I asked him where he had come from.  He told me he had been in the toilet on the first floor and I  said it was impossible because I had been there just before going down  to the basement and that there had been nobody there.   I asked him where his uniform was.  He showed it to me,  it was in a plastic bag under the table inside the office where they were performing their duties. \n\tAt this stage Samuel was also a suspect in a R60 000 theft of a money container.   This had disappeared from the safe area, there from the basement area,  a couple of days previously.  The video monitors had been tampered with, had been opened and some of the tapes had been removed.  I then decided to take Samuel to my office to wait for my staff  and his manager.  At this stage I  was determined, as a result of the information which I had received,  to clear up this matter.  (Inaudible) ... inside Fidelity Guards had been involved in this robbery.  Later that morning some of my staff members started arriving at the office as well as Samuel's branch manager.  I called him to my office and I told him what I knew.  I also decided to call the shop steward to my office.  I was experiencing great pressure from the Trade Unions at that stage in connection with the interrogation of  people in my office.  Both these members agreed they wanted to find out what the circumstances were and that we had to pursue our investigation of  Samuel  to expose  everybody involved in the robbery.\n\tI contacted the investigating officer, Detective Officer Dempsey.  I had to contact Lieutenant Steyn, his section head.  I spoke to Lieutenant Steyn and told him what had happened.  He informed me that he was involved  in an urgent bail application in the Supreme Court and that he couldn't help me, but that I had to continue with the investigation.  At this stage  Honourable Commissioners I  must mention that we  were busy with  investigations on an ongoing basis.  I had opened files similar to police  files, I took statements for the police.  I was appointed as a Commissioner of Oaths by the Department of Justice to facilitate matters and in this way we constantly exchanged statements with the police.   We investigated matters  very thoroughly so that it could  be handed to the Department of Justice for prosecution or whatever.  So I liaised with the  police on a very high level.  When  I realised that nobody could help me  I decided to speak to Samuel.  It was clear that he was very uncomfortable.  Some of my investigators, for instance Oosthuizen, he  isn't here today, and two black investigating  officers, Jack Makoana and Julius Xhosa,  I  asked them to  also  speak to Samuel to see whether we could get any information out of him.   As I have already said, these people were nervous.  This man was nervous, he didn't want to say anything in the office.  I then decided that he had to be taken to a field across from the Johannesburg Market for interrogation and questioning. \n\tHe was taken out of the premises by a side exit and taken by vehicle to this open field.    I was in radio contact with them and at a later stage Johan van Eck also followed them in his bakkie.  Because I still had other duties to perform at the office I went there a  little bit  later. \n\tUpon arrival there I noticed that members from the electricity department, workers from the electricity department were busy working on the robots and that they would be able to observe us.  We were trying to talk to Samuel.  I noticed and realised that this was not an appropriate place for an interrogation so I decided to go to Cleveland  forest area where we  usually had braais. \n\tWhen we arrived there I took Samuel out of the car and I spoke to him.  I asked him to help us with urgent information, we needed the information very urgently.  I told him that I could help him if  he gave me the information I needed, namely who the men were that were involved in the robbery on the 27th March.  He denied any knowledge of the incident and I decided to extract the information from him by means of coercion.  These  methods were commonly known.    During the Commission's sessions throughout South Africa these methods have been revealed.  I had a rope and shocking machine in my car.",

I then attached the shock machine to his private parts.   I pulled a bag over his head and we started applying shocks.   We constantly spoke to him and asked him where the other people were, the other people that we were looking for.   Each one of the investigators present  took part in this procedure, shock procedure.  The two black investigators spoke to him in his own language.  Samuel, however, refused to part with any information.  At one stage I sent the black investigators to go and buy some cooldrinks Samuel was still hanging from the tree.  There was liquor in\nmy car and we started drinking.  \n\tDuring these type of investigations and interrogations alcohol is always used.   No right-thinking person can act  in this way without your conscience plaguing you.  During the day Oosthuizen took out a firearm and shot two shots in the direction of the deceased where he was hanging from the tree.   We spoke to him very seriously and said that it must not happen again.  It was at no stage our intention to kill Samuel.  Later that afternoon Jack Makoena and Julius Xhosa  came to me and asked if they could leave.  It was about five o'clock in the afternoon.  Jack had to attend a class and the other one had to be dropped off at his home, and I said yes, they could leave.",

            "Your Honour, at one stage I took some of the bluegum leaves  lying around there and I set them on fire  to cause smoke right underneath Samuel's head.  There were no flames at any stage, just caused a lot of smoke, and  I  did this to make  Samuel even more uncomfortable.  At about half past five, quarter to six, it was already starting to get dark and we decided  to remove Samuel from the tree.  It was clear that he was very uncomfortable as a result of being suspended from the tree all day.  I told him to walk up and down a bit to improve his circulation.  And after a  while he came and sat down a little distance a way from us.  I spoke to him again and I explained to him that all these things were totally unnecessary if he would just cooperate with us.  He made no comment.  In the next moment Oosthuizen took out his firearm and shot Samuel through the shoulder without any reason, without saying anything.  Samuel  immediately jumped up and charged Johan van Eck and grabbed him as if he sought protection from him.   My colleague pushed him away.  At this stage there was a lot of blood, he was also covered in blood and he ran in the direction of the bakkie which was parked not very far away.  He tried to jump into the bakkie.  He was presumably trying to protect himself, but they pulled him away before he could jump into the bakkie and then Samuel started running in the direction of the mind dumps, not very far away.  That was when I realised that we had big problems.  I took my firearm and I shot Samuel.  He fell down into a ditch and  - because it was nearly dark at that stage.  I went to my car to fetch my torch and started moving in the direction where Samuel had  run.  I found him, he was lying on the ground and when I shone the torch on him he jumped up again, grabbed the torch and started running again.  He ran further along the ditch.  I still had my firearm in my hand and shot two shots.  I heard him falling again and I moved in that direction.  (Inaudible) stomach.  I shone the torch again and I noticed that he had been fatally wounded.  I felt his pulse, I felt his throat.  There was no pulse any more, he was dead.\n\tAt this stage we were in a panic because we decided whilst Samuel was still sitting on the ground to take him to a police station, probably Brixton, to detain him.    The very negligible injuries on his body we could explain away, but to arrive at a police station with a seriously wounded or dead person was a different matter altogether.  It  could have been fatal for myself and my investigators.   We decided to dispose of the body.  My colleague Johan van Eck offered to put him in his bakkie and to take him  to a forest area in Benoni which was known to him and to set the corpse on fire there.  Oosthuizen would accompany him.  As a result of the dust in the forest area we lost touch with each other on the freeway.  They weren't in radio contact with me.  The black investigators had the radio in their  car and I decided to return to my home where I would then later contact Van Eck.  At about quarter to ten that  evening I phoned Van Eck at his home and he told me that he had set the body on fire.  I told him not  to come to work the next morning, but to clean his bakkie and that I would do the necessary at the office.  \n\tThe next morning, quite early, the two investigators came to me to find out what had happened.  I called them to my office and told them that Samuel Ranaka is dead.  They didn't seem to be very shocked.  Whilst we were discussing the matter they agreed to say that they had transported him from the forest area and that they had dropped him off (inaudible).  I contacted Samuel's branch manager, Mr Roos, and told him that we had dropped him off and that  he was supposed to report the next morning but that it had never happened. \n\tAfter about a week there was still no sign of Samuel.  We are not quite sure why.   The incident was reported to   the Hillbrow branch that he was missing.  Brig Van Wyk took two statements under oath from the black investigating officers to the effect that they had directed an inquiry to a major at the Hillbrow branch.\n\tAt this stage I should perhaps mention that for the last six or seven years I often received freedom charters during surprise investigations.  I found these in drawers, briefcases.  I even found slogans painted on the walls, ANC, PAC slogans in the building of the Hillbrow branch.",

            "A month or so after this  unfortunate incident Oosthuizen and myself and a former member of the Task Force met at a small bar near our offices.  Oosthuizen then reprimanded me for the way in which I was conducting my investigations.  He thought that he knew better because he was one of Eugene de Kock's men and they dealt with matters very differently, and he also tackled me about a written warning which I had given him, this is now after the murder, a warning regarding his conduct and his way of working.   He often disappeared and I wouldn't know where he was.  The next moment he pulled out his firearm.  I was standing  opposite him.  He aimed it at my head and cocked it.  I knew  that there was a bullet in the barrel.  That's the way we worked.  And myself and Mr John Cook reprimanded him and told him to stop playing these games.   He kept attacking me and tackling me about this letter which  I had sent him, a notice, and he once again aimed his firearm at me.  I then had my firearm behind my back and I removed the safety catch at some stage.  I also had a bullet in my firearm and I then - when he aimed his pistol at me I shot him through the shoulder.  I could have killed him if I wanted to.   He fell to the ground.  His firearm was in front of him and I removed it from him.\n\tHe was later admitted  to a clinic in Johannesburg.  An emergency operation was performed on him.  I visited him but he was still in the operating theatre, and I decided to just leave matters as they were  until such time as  he contacted me and that is what I did.  \n\tHe then contacted me on a Sunday after this incident.  The  incident itself happened on a Thursday evening.  At that stage I hadn't reported the incident  to my top management.  Upon my arrival at the hospital with Mr Cook, who had also been present that evening, Oosthuizen suggested that he was going to report the matter.  He was going to say that he had been attacked by an unknown assailant in a little quiet street in Hillbrow.  I told him to do what he thought best.  I then returned on the Monday and reported the shooting incident to my management.  As a  result of my senior  position in the company they decided to suspend and Oosthuizen as well.  I then later learnt that Oosthuizen had laid a charge of attempted murder against me at the Hillbrow Police Station.  I made a complete statement regarding this incident and as a result of this statement in which I had explained all the circumstances, the senior state prosecutor declined to prosecute. \n\tI then broke off all contact with Oosthuizen.  After my suspension I resigned and I left Fidelity Guards.",

I would like to extend my hand this morning and to ask forgiveness and reconciliation.  But that's not all.  I also want  to apologise to my family from where I am sitting here this morning.  I want to apologise for everything that I have done to them.  I remarried.  I actually forgot to mention that I remarried and my wife has supported me throughout  under very difficult circumstances.

And  to all my colleagues and friends, all those  whom I disappointed, I  would like to apologise  as well.\n\tI would like  to ask that other people in my position, they might perhaps not be in prison, but outside, I want to say to them that only a small part of what actually took  place has been disclosed to the public and to the world  at  large, but nobody has actually spoken about the assaults  and attempts on us and our lives, how we were intimidated, shot at, houses burnt down and the terrible battle which we  had to fight as well.  And for that reason  I appeal to everybody out there to come forward and to tell the Commission where things went wrong so that there can be reconciliation in this country.    They say that stress kills and causes you to kill, but nobody talks about how  stress  kills you as a person.",
