<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Morning everybody, I must apologise for the late start.  When we adjourned yesterday, Mr Visser was questioning Mr Mbane, and we'll take off from there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">FRANK XHOLA MBANE:</span> (s.u.o.)</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Visser.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR VISSER:</span> (cont)</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a>	Thank you, and good morning, Chairperson.  If I may continue then.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a>	Mr Mbane,  - well perhaps before I continue with that Chairperson, we have cause to have placed before you, an extract from the police docket, which we believe might be relevant to you.  I don't know whether you are one of those lawyers, Chairperson, who believes that "I" is not a letter of the alphabet ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I don't know why, but I am, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> So am I.  So this will be J, Chairperson,</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Exhibit J.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Exhibit J.   Just to explain the background to this document, Chairperson, I didn't want to have that photocopied as well, but it is in the police docket, in the police diary under Section C, there is an entry which says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a>"During 1994 to 1995, Capt de Jongh had a discussion with one, Jimmy Mbane, who was a former member of Vlakplaas.  Notes were kept."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a>and it refers to B1.  Now the document before you, Exhibit J, you will see is B1, Chairperson, so this ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If you could just repeat that person's name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> De Jongh, Capt de Jongh, spelt J-o-n-g-h.  And I will momentarily refer to that at the appropriate stage, Chairperson, with your leave.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes and I see it's September 1997, that's the docket number, is it?  So it would have been, either during '97 or thereafter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, I was going to ask - in fact yes, you're absolutely correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The docket number is 2004/9/97.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> '97, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So it's obviously not before September '97?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> It would be safe to accept that, Chairperson.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a>	Mr Mbane, you had dealings with Ms Kubheka, on quite a number of occasions during the six weeks that you told us about, would that be correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> How would you describe her stature?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Can you please repeat your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> How would you describe her physical appearance, as you saw her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> She was short and she was fat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I can't hear the Interpreter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> She was a short person and she was also fat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> I can't hear it either.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I can hear it, check your volume on the machine.  Mr Visser, could you just check your volume and see if you're got the right ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I've just done that, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> She was a short person and she was also fat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you listen to the description given by Mr Hentie Botha, of the late Ms Kubheka, when he gave evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Can you please repeat your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you listen to the evidence of Mr Hentie Botha, when he gave evidence about how he remembered what she looked like?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And did you agree with that evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And did you see the exhibits that were placed before the Committee yesterday, Exhibits 1, 2, 3 and 4?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And did you agree with the evidence of Mr du Preez and Mr Wasserman about those exhibits and whether they would fit, Ms Kubheka?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> According to what I saw, I think that those clothes were small.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, thank you.  I just want to try to clarify in my own mind, perhaps for some of the Commissioners, I'm not sure, perhaps I'm the only one that doesn't understand this.  The people that you handed over to your seniors, please stop me if I'm wrong, the one person was Sbu, S-b-u, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> The other person was a person whose name you can't remember, but who you said was killed and his body was left at a hotel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Who was the third person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> It is the one that we found weapons from him in the squatter camps.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Was that or was that not Gipsman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> No, it was not Gipsman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And apart from the one that was killed and his body left near a hotel, do you know what happened to the other two?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> No, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Let me ask you this specifically, you don't know what happened to Sbu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> The last time I saw him it was when I handed him over to my seniors, I don't know what happened to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  Now did I hear you correctly, to say that - well, let me ask you, who of your seniors did you hand Sbu to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> It was Joe from Vlakplaas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that Joe Coetzer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, Joe Coetzer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, before you proceed Mr Visser.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a>	Mr Mbane, where did you live at that time, where did you come from?  Where was your place in that period of time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Here in Durban?</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, where did you live normally?  Where did you regard your home to be?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> In Britz, in eHlabili(?)</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright.  Would you have told anyone that Sbu was killed by Hentie Botha?  Would you have told anyone that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I don't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That's not the question you see, you've told this Committee, Mr Mbane, that you made a deduction that your seniors had killed Sbu, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Now I'm asking you, on that evidence, would you ever have told anyone that you know that Botha killed Sbu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I can't remember, I don't remember telling anyone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Would you have told anyone that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> What I'm saying, is I can't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright, alright.  You see because on the record, at page 1720 to 1721, it was put on your behalf that Sbu was killed by Botha and others.  Particularly at page 1721, the second paragraph, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a>	Now why did you tell your attorney that?  Well, did you tell you're attorney that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, it might happen that I told him, but there are a lot of people who spoke to me concerning this case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I'm not talking about other people, I'm talking about what you told you attorney, Mr Mbane.  Did you tell your attorney that Sbu was killed by Botha and others?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> It might be so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Why would you have done that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I don't understand your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> It's a perfectly simply question, you told this Committee that you don't know what happened to the Sbu, but you made a deduction, you inferred that he was killed by your seniors, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And I asked you whether you know whether Botha killed him, and you said no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> That was what I thought, I thought that they were killed by, he was killed by Botha and the people he was working with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Oh, now you heard that.  From whom did you hear that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Thought.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I thought.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I didn't hear you, I'm sorry.  Alright, that's what you thought, you thought it was Botha and others who killed him, is that what you're saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you think Taylor was one of those who killed Sbu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Let me explain this.  Taylor would come, he would not be there every day, he would come and leave.  The person who would always be there would be Botha.  So Taylor would come on certain days and sometimes he would not be there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright, that's very interesting, now answer the question.  Did you think that Taylor was one of the persons who killed Sbu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I don't know about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I see.  Now can I refer you to Exhibit J ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUEL:</span> Mr Chairman, before any questions are put to my client, we'd like to object to the cross-examination on the grounds that my client will say that he does not recall, there were a number of people who had asked him questions over various periods, and he can't recall specifically giving this statement to any particular person.  Secondly, he will say that this statement is not signed by him.  So if Mr Visser will lay some basis before putting any questions to my client, I'll appreciate it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> May I reply to that?  Chairperson, first of all, this is a Commission of Inquiry, where we are trying to find out the truth of matters and where we are not strictly bound to the normal rules of evidence, although one stays as close to those rules as possible.  I'm not producing this document as a confession, I found this document Chairperson, in the docket which became available to us for the first time, yesterday.  It pretends to be notes taken of a consultation and I want to use it for no evidentiary value higher than that.  It's not as if we are asking you to accept this document as proof of the contents thereof, it is simply a document which I wish to use to ask Mr Mbane certain questions, and he can answer and at the end of the day you would be in the position, Chairperson, to weigh up the probabilities on the issues.  And that's as far as it goes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Samuel, any reply?</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUEL:</span> There's no reply, except I'll leave myself in your hands, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes Mr Visser, you may ask questions on this document, on the basis which is stated by yourself and I can confirm that we will not be using this as evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a>	Now one of these people of the many people that spoke to you was, at least one of them was a policeman that spoke to you about the matter of Kubheka?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I cannot remember.  As I've already said there are a lot of people that asked me questions concerning what was happening in Vlakplaas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you no policeman ever tell you that they were investigating, the police was investigating the death of Ms Kubheka, and spoke to you in connection therewith?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, there are a lot of them, it was not only one policeman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Do you know a Capt de Jongh?</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> As I have already said, there are a lot of people who asked me questions, so I cannot remember him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, the question - you say you can't remember, but do you know Capt de Jongh?</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I cannot remember him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where is he from again, Mr Visser?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That's the diary, C ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes I know, but to which police station is he attached, or to which division or ...?</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Chairperson, we would have to speculate, we don't know where he was from, we believe it was the so-called D'Oliviera team, but I don't want to ...  But the point is that this conversation took place at, apparently, at CR Swart Square, but even that may be wrong.  I don't want to limit it too much on facts that I don't know, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In any event, Mr Mbane says he doesn't know a de Jongh, he can't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> He doesn't know a de Jongh.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a>	Now would you have told Mr de Jongh that when you went to Durban, it was Andy Taylor and Botha who gave instructions?  Is that something you would have told him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> As I have already said, I cannot remember de Jongh, so it is difficult to say that I would have told him, because I can't remember him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Mbane, that answer is not going to help.  I'm asking you on a facts of the Kubheka matter which you knew and which you testified to before this Committee, would you have told anyone that Andy Taylor and Botha gave the instructions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I still say that I cannot remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> May I can help you here.  Mr Mbane, it doesn't matter who you spoke to, I mean even if we were asking you here now, if you were telling us about this incident, and you have already told us about this incident, what Mr Visser's asking you, is it likely that you would have said to somebody that amongst other people, Taylor and Botha gave some of the instructions around this matter?  Is that correct or isn't it?  That's all you're being asked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> It might be so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you, Mr Lax.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a>	You would have told any such person that you infiltrated Ntombi Kubheka, would that be correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, it might be so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Wouldn't you have told somebody that, because that's your evidence here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Sir, what I'm saying is, there are a lot of people who asked me questions about this case, so what I'm saying is that it might be possible that I would have said so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well let's try to cut this short.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUEL:</span> Mr Chairman, if I may come in at this point.  This document was given to us at a very late stage and my instruction was to object to the document being handed in, and on that basis I have not consulted with my client properly.  I think, in order to take this matter forward, because it seems it's going to go around in circles, if I may have just five minutes to advise my client on this document ...(indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well Chairperson, ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It's during cross-examination and we've got that rule, but what's your attitude, Mr Visser?</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Chairperson, I wouldn't even object to that, but the point is, my learned friend is obviously doesn't understand what the basis of my cross-examination is, I'm not testing his memory as to whether he remembers a de Jongh, or whatever, I'm asking him basically, whether he would have told anyone else what he told this Committee.  But if my learned friend feels that he'll feel more comfortable if he consulted with the witness, I want to be fair to the witness, as fair as we can, I would have no objection.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, but if we do that, I see this document contains a whole lot of incidents that wouldn't require any consultation with you, if we could perhaps identify those parts which Mr Samuel should go through with his client.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Chairperson, I will ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That's the one that's headed ...(indistinct) Sbu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> ... I will contain myself to the first, second ...</p>

<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Second page, the third page, over the page to before "Swartklip - start 1985."</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Stop at Swartklip?</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, just that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  And then the rest is not of any interest to us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> They deal with other matters, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So have you got that, Mr Samuel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUEL:</span> I have, Mr Chairman.  The reason why I ask for this adjournment is because the questions are straightforward, but it seems like my client does not understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, I think the questions you could have been asked without any reference to this in any event.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUEL:</span> That's right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Absolutely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, but if you want that five minutes and if that will assist in speeding it up in the long run, we'll take a five minute adjournment to allow you to discuss that ...</p>

<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a>	Mr Mbane, having now had an opportunity to consult with your attorney about this document, Exhibit J, ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> ... are you now prepared to answer some of the questions which I put to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I will answer what I know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright.  Let's just talk about Sbu.  You see, according to Exhibit J - Chairperson, may I suggest that the pages be paginated 1, 2, 3 and 4, it makes it very difficult if we don't do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> According to this statement, and you must please tell us if you disagree with what I'm putting to you, you told Capt de Jongh that you were sent to go and look for Mr Sbu in Lamontville, would that have been correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And you were told that he had weapons that he had given, and that he knew where other terrorists were, can you remember that you were told that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Who told me that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well did you tell - would you have told Mr de Jongh that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think when you say he had weapons, perhaps you can qualify it that he had weapons in Transkei.</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well Chairperson, if you look at the bottom of page 2, it doesn't specify the Transkei.</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well it's the top of page 3.</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  Oh I see, yes of course.  But that's what he told them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, but I think if you could just ...(indistinct) was that he had weapons in Lamontville ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUEL:</span> Mr Chairman, the way the questions are being asked, if I may come in at this stage, is as if that conversation in fact took place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He's asking him whether ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUEL:</span> Whether he would have told any other person similar facts, not specifically Capt de Jongh, because according to my client he can't remember whether he had spoken to Capt de Jongh.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, well we know that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUEL:</span> Alright.  On that basis, yes Chairman, we'll proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well, is my learned friend disputing that de Jongh had a conversation with this person, Chairperson, and if so, on what basis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUEL:</span> As we say, we can't remember whether there was a Capt de Jongh that had a conversation with ...(indistinct), so on that basis we will answer general questions as if, would he have told any person about these incidents if he was interviewed by any person.  Whether he'd spoken specifically to Capt de Jongh, we will deny it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Chairperson, may I just inform you what we've learnt in the meantime?  Capt de Jongh is on pension, he's taken a package, he resides in Bloemfontein, we will try to trace him and if necessary ask for a subpoena to be issued for him to come and give evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you.  But I think it's clearly understood, certainly by Members of the Panel, that Mr Mbane cannot recall ever speaking to Capt de Jongh.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUEL:</span> I'm indebted, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Maybe if he sees Capt de Jongh if he happens to be called, it might jog his memory and then he might remember it ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUEL:</span> Possibly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You see the point is, Mr Mbane, that Mr - well, Exhibit J says that you would have said that Sbu stated that there are weapons in the Transkei, and that coincides with your evidence here today, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Right.  Then lower down, in the middle of the page at page 3, you say - well, would you have told someone that you handed Sbu to the white officers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, that is correct, I can say so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Now I want you to please give your opinion as to the next sentence that I will read to you</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a>"Sbu was interrogated in my presence and he died.  Also as a result of an electric shock."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a>Loosely translated, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a>	Would you have told anyone that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I don't remember telling anybody something like this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That is not the question, I'm not asking you to remember, I'm asking you whether you would have told anyone that these are the facts?  That's my question to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> No, there's nobody I would have told that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And would you have told anyone that Miyeza and a white person went to get rid of the body of Sbu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> No, there is no such.</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Let me ask you the last question on the Sbu issue.  According to Exhibit A, it appears that you told someone, well it appears that you told de Jongh, but call it someone, that you were present when Sbu died, now would that be true or would that be false?</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> That is not true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You recall that yesterday I asked you in connection with Kubheka, what the purpose of the operation was, and you agreed that you were supposed to find out the whereabouts and weapons of four MK soldiers in the Durban area, can you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, I can remember that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Now I also asked you whether your instructions on the day when Kubheka was abducted, was to fetch the Commander of the four MK soldiers and to bring the Commander and any one of his soldiers under him, that you could, to Battery Beach?</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Is that a question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Mbane, let me try to make it simpler for you.  Botha gave evidence to say that your instructions, as far as he knows, were to bring the Commander, the MK Commander to Battery Beach, not Kubheka, did you hear that evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, I heard that evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Do you agree with that evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> No, I don't agree with it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  Because you told this Committee that your instructions were to bring Kubheka to Battery Beach - to the beach.</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> That is correct, those were instructions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  Now I ask you again, who gave you those instructions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> It was Botha, because Taylor was not present.  Botha and Simon gave me those instructions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, Mr Mbane, who is Simon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Radebe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Radebe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You see at page 2 of Exhibit J, there is an indication that you might have told de Jongh that it was Taylor who gave you the instructions to bring her to the beach, to Battery Beach.</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I disagree with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  And you see, Taylor himself in his amnesty application, does not say specifically that he gave you the - page 4 of bundle 1, Chairperson, that he gave you the instruction, but what he says is, at the last paragraph at page 4</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a>"At a later stage an askari, Jimmy Mbane, informed us that he had arranged that the Kubheka woman would be brought to us at the old Railway Police shooting range near Winkelspruit."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a>Now what I want to put to you on this application as it stands, and unfortunately Mr Taylor is not here to explain, he does not mention anything about Botha giving instructions.  I'm just pointing that out to you.  And I want to suggest to you that you in fact told de Jongh that Taylor was the one who gave the instructions for Kubheka to be brought to Battery Beach.</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> That is not true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright.  If I put it to you that you told someone that you participated in torturing Ms Kubheka, what would you say about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> That is a lie, that is not true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well let me read to you what is stated in Exhibit J, in the middle of page 2</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a>"Later that night while we tortured her, she died."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a>Would you say that's completely wrong, as far as your participation is concerned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> That is not true, just false.</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Now you see, when I cross-examined you yesterday, I put to you that you are wrong that Botha told you that it might have been Taylor, and then your attorney said on record, no, that's correct, you will confirm that it was Taylor who gave you that instruction, not Botha.  Did you hear him say that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> No, I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And just to ask you the last question on this issue, in your evidence before this Committee you were not specific that it was Botha, you said you thought it might have been Botha, is that correct?  Yesterday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> What would happen is that Botha was the one who would give us instructions, because this was his operation, Taylor was the overall Commander.</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Mbane, at Winkelspruit, while you were making ready to go to sleep under the tarpaulin on the veranda, you told this Committee yesterday that you heard Kubheka scream in pain, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You were close enough to hear what was going on in the room where she was interrogated, is that what you're saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I couldn't see what was happening inside, but I could hear her screaming.</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Could you hear people talking inside that storeroom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I could just hear voices, but I couldn't hear what they were saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> If a firearm was discharged inside that storeroom, would you have heard it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And you heard no firearm being discharged, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> No, I did not hear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And your evidence was that at some stage, people came out of the storeroom and you were told that the lady had died.</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And you went further to say that it was Botha that told you that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And you told us that the people who came out of the storeroom were running around, or words to that effect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Were they confused and worried, what would you say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I can say that they were worried and they were also confused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  Did Botha tell you that he thought that she had died of a heart attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> That is what he told me, Botha and Baker.</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Baker as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> ...(indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I'm sorry, I didn't follow you, was it Baker that told you that, or was it Botha and Baker?</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Botha and Baker were the ones who would come to us and ask questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Mbane, ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, the question, all we want to know, Mr Mbane, is what you said a moment ago.  You said Botha said that he thought that she had died of a heart attack, and then you also Baker, now what Mr Visser wants to know is, did Baker also say that he thought she had died of a heart attack?  That is all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And did you believe them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> No, I did not believe them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Why not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> It is because I could hear that the deceased was screaming inside that room.</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  And in terms of Exhibit J, page 2 - just before the heading "Sbu", Mr Chairman, I want to ask you, do you know that Ms Kubheka was given electric shocks at Winkelspruit?  Do you know that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> No, I don't know that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you at any stage see that she was assaulted by hitting her kneecaps with beer bottles?</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I don't know anything about the beer bottles.</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  And you would have told nobody that that is what you saw?  You wouldn't have told anybody.</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> No, I don't remember that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> After you were told that Kubheka died, you told us also, at some stage she was carried out of the room to a vehicle, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And yesterday I recall that you told the Committee first of all, that she was placed in a kombi, can you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> It was then pointed out that du Preez gave evidence to say that it was in a Nissan Skyline, do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, I remember him saying that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> From your own memory what do you say today, in which vehicle, in what type of vehicle was Kubheka placed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> It might happen that it's a kombi, it might also happen that it was a Skyline.</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> These vehicles are quite easily distinguishable because they're completely different, do you have any recollection as you sit here now, of the placing of the body into the vehicle, or is that completely forgotten, you've got no idea, you can't remember a thing about it as you sit here now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I cannot remember it clearly, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright.  You see the interesting part is, Exhibit J states according to this exhibit, that you told Capt de Jongh also that she was placed in a kombi, at page 2.  That's quite a coincidence, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I cannot remember telling Capt de Jongh that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright.  ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, just while you're on this point, Mr Visser, before it slips my mind.</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a>	You said in your evidence that after the deceased had died, people were running around etcetera, and they were sort of waiting for Mr Miyeza to come, they waited until Mr Miyeza came and then only when Mr Miyeza came they loaded the body into the vehicle, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can you think of any reason why they would have had to have waited for Mr Miyeza?</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> According to what I thought, Miyeza as the person who was staying in the township, maybe they thought that he would be the person who would identify a spot where they would throw the body.  That's what I thought.</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Mr Visser?</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you, Chairperson, I'm almost through.</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a>	And will you just remind us what you remember, who were the people who carried her to the vehicle and who took her away?</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> It was Lawrie - my problem is that I didn't know the names of the Durban people, but Lawrie was there, Miyeza and the other one who was present here yesterday, but I don't know his name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just for the record, is Lawrie, is that Mr Wasserman?  And the other one would have been, the one that gave evidence, that was recalled, was Mr du Preez?</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright.  I know it's a long time ago, but would you have told anyone that Coetzer was one of the people who participated in this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Chairperson, I'm not going to take this further, I assume that one of my learned friends acting for Miyeza, will take this further, so I don't want an overlap.  I have no further questions, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR VISSER</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Perhaps because of questions asked by Commissioner Bosman yesterday, I must just point out Chairperson, that in the docket we found copies of S&amp;T, reports and you can obviously check them yourselves, but what I've done is I've extracted from the docket a photocopy through the assistance of Ms Kubheka, of - Ms Thabethe, of Mr Mbane, where it appears Chairperson, that FX Mbane was in Port Natal from the 14th of May 1987 until the 29th of May 1987.  And what is of interest, Chairperson, going through those document, is that Mr de Kock came down, as you will recall there is some evidence to that effect from Coetzer, Mr de Kock came down and that happened on the 19th of May 1987 to the 22nd of May, and Chairperson, on the evidence, if one accepts that at face value, that Coetzer spoke to de Kock when he was in Durban and told him that Mbane had been sent back to the house of Ms Kubheka and that he had told him not to go and de Kock told him to withdraw.  That would give you some idea of the date when Ms Kubheka would have died.  It would have been just before the 22nd of May, Chairperson.  That's the closest we could get to identifying a date.</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you, Mr Visser.  So the death would likely be just before 22 May 1987.</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Sorry Mr Chair, what about the date that we were given earlier on, the 25th of April, where it was indicated that the mother had gone to attend a wedding?</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, but maybe those dates we don't know ...(end of side A of tape)</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well Chairperson, I didn't make a study of the docket, I think that the only ones here are relevant to the Kubheka matter.  Let me just go through them very briefly, the ones I have.  I'm not sure whether these are all of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Sorry, Mr Chairperson, maybe I can help.  I think it's common cause that the Vlakplaas team were here for some months preceding this and that the specific S&amp;T records for the month of April are in fact missing and they're not in the docket.  There's no S&amp;T records for the month of April, as my perusal of the docket indicates.  So we just have the May ones.  We don't dispute they were here in May, we don't dispute that they were here in April and I don't think that Mr Visser and Mr Wagener do, but the S&amp;T records for Vlakplaas members for April are missing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  Chairperson, to reply to Commissioner's Lax's question, yes we have found also in the docket S&amp;T forms relating to February.  I wasn't aware that there are S&amp;T forms for April missing, I have no reason to doubt that information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And it may be that Mr de Kock during that period, February through to May, came from time to time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> For a day or two.</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Absolutely, it would have made sense, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Hugo, do you have any questions that you'd like to ask?</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR HUGO:</span> Yes thank you, Mr Chairman.  I was going to kick off with the date of the incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a>	Mr Mbane, can you remember whether you stayed in Durban for a continuous period during this particular operation or whether you had occasion to go back to Pretoria and then come back and continue with this operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> No, we stayed here continuously until the end of the operation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> How long, to the best of your recollection, did this operation last?</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Three to five weeks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Now if you would just be so kind as to look at bundle 2, this is really a summary of the documents that Mr Visser has been referring to, it's page 78.  This is a statement by the investigating officer, or one of the investigating officers, a Mr Holmes, and from that it would appear that you were claiming S&amp;T for the period 14th of May to the 29th of May, would you say that this was the total period that you spent here in Durban, or were you here for a longer period?</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> No, we stayed more than that time.  If I can still remember well, we came here in April, but I'm not sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Did you come down here towards the end of April, or the beginning of April?</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Towards the end of April.</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And how did you travel from Pretoria to Durban?</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> We travelled by kombis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And who was the driver of the kombi that you were a passenger in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> If I can still remember well, I think it was uncle Moss or Letsatsi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Yes, and then when you arrived here in Durban, were you introduced to, amongst other people, to Mr Miyeza?</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> What was the purpose of you being introduced to Mr Miyeza, what was he supposed to do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> What they would do when we arrived in a certain area, they would introduce us to a person who would show us the area, the townships, the stations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Is it correct that Mr Miyeza was really just mandated to show you around in general terms, he didn't specifically have to deal with the Kubheka incident itself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> No, he knew about this operation while we were busy with it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Yes, but initially he just showed you around and showed you where the various townships were, etcetera?</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Then as far as the initial introduction to Ms Kubheka, I'm just going to give you a summary of what I understood your evidence to be, you must just tell me if I'm wrong, first of all you said that you arrived here, for the first three days you were at CR Swart, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And then yesterday you testified that you were introduced to a certain Gipsman and that he gave you information about the terrorists and he would then lead you to Ms Kubheka, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And on the strength of his evidence you then sometime later went to Ms Kubheka, where you were introduced to her as being fellow comrades, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And Ms Kubheka then said to you that there was a problem with accommodation for comrades that were coming in from exile and you then said to her that you have safe-houses where you could take these people to, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And just as far as the sequence of the events is concerned, you first then testified that a man from Zambia was mentioned and he was then handed over at a roadblock, a false roadblock you called it, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And then there was, the second incident was Sbu and he was handed over at Winkelspruit, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And then as far as the sequence is concerned, a third man, also a comrade and he was, on the strength of your evidence, killed by Mr Radebe.  Are you happy with that version?</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And that all three of these men were introduced to you by Ms Kubheka as being comrades, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Now would you please just go back to page 128 of bundle 1.  I'll read to you, this is paragraph 42 ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just for record purposes, this is from Mr Mbane's statement.  From your statement, Mr Mbane.</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Yes, Mr Mbane, you say there</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a>"Myself and Dube went to Ntombi's place.  We asked for Ntombi and fortunately the person we were asking was Ntombi."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a>Now this is not what you told us yesterday, would you agree?</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, I agree.</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> So this particular statement is wrong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Because we had our accommodation, so this means that there's something wrong here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Yes.  And what is also obvious from this statement is that you don't at all mention the fact that the Gipsman was there and he in fact introduced you to Ntombi.  Would you agree with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, it is not in the statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Now can you give this Committee any reason as to why you didn't mention this in this statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> As this happened a long time ago, maybe I forgot to mention it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Yes.  And what is also intriguing is that you say there</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a>"We had some discussion with her and we told her that we were from exile and we need accommodation."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a>That's also wrong, isn't that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Now why did you put it like that in the statement, what is the reason for that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I don't know, maybe I made a mistake or I forgot about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Yes.  But I thought your attorney yesterday at the inception of the cross-examination of Mr Radebe, indicated that he took cognisance of the fact that Mr Radebe's memory wasn't all that good and had been affected by his health, but then he said in the same breath that your memory is very good and very clear, is that not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUEL:</span> If I may come in there, Mr Chairman, if you read the statement, paragraph 42 of that statement, it shows that there is most probably some mistaken, either in interpretation.  It's obvious that Mr Mbane did not type out this statement himself.  Further, if you look at that statement carefully, you'll find that he tells Ntombi that he's looking for accommodation and in the same paragraph he finds accommodation.  Ntombi tells them that there is another comrade that needs a place of safety.</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, but I think that Mr Hugo's entitled to ask the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUEL:</span> Fine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Because I was under the impression that this statement wasn't disputed by your client when he testified, Mr Samuel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUEL:</span> Fine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> It was in fact confirmed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, it was in fact confirmed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a>	Now what is further very interesting is that the sequence in this statement differs completely from what you told us yesterday.  Here, and I'm referring you to paragraph 44, well actually 43, you mention that the first person was killed by Mr Radebe and the body was left at the Executive Hotel and then you mention Mr Sbu.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> That's the way it is written here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And then you mention the Kubheka matter, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Now once more you make no mention whatsoever of the first person that was abducted and handed over to the white people at this false roadblock, as you recalled it yesterday, why didn't you mention that in your statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> It might happen that I mentioned it but it happened.  Maybe it's not written here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Now something that was also very interesting is the fact that you mentioned yesterday, for the first time might I add, that the man that was handed over at the roadblock, I think you referred to him as a man that come from Zambia, you assumed was killed, and can you remember what reason you proffered or tendered as to why you thought that he had been killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> The reason why I thought that he was killed was because in the morning we were given his watch, his bag and others took his clothes.  That is why I thought that they had killed him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Yes.  Can you remember what you testified as to who got the watch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> It was Simon Radebe and I took the bag.</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And the clothes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Dube took the clothes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> You see what I find interesting about this is, this was never put to any of the witnesses by your attorney, when did you tell him about this for the first time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> If I still remember I think I told him yesterday or days before.</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can't you remember whether you told him yesterday or not?  You say you can't remember whether you told him yesterday or days before, did you tell him yesterday for the first time, or was it before yesterday?  Surely you can remember back to yesterday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I think it was yesterday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Yes, but you see what I find almost totally unacceptable is that Mr Radebe testified yesterday and there was a golden opportunity to put this to Mr Radebe, and it wasn't done, have you got any reason as to why it wasn't done?</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I don't know, I don't have any reason why he was not asked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> By the way, the clothes, what did Mr Dube do with that?  On your version.</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I don't know what he did with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Do you know whether they would have fitted him?  Weren't they too big or too small for him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> They would have fitted him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And may I just refer you again to Exhibit J, you don't have to read it, but there you refer to a necklace as well, "'n hangertjie", that was given to you as a gift.  Was that also in fact what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I don't remember about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> You didn't mention a "hangertjie" or this necklace?</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> No, I didn't mention any necklace.</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> The man that you allege that had been killed by Mr Radebe, on your evidence yesterday this was now the first person handed over to you, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, on the evidence yesterday it was the third person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> The third person, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The third person, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> That's right, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a>	You then said that it was unplanned, but you nevertheless reported this to your seniors, you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, I remember saying that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Which seniors was this reported to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> The white people that were with us there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Yes, no but give us names, give us more details.</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Botha got that message and Coetzer from Vlakplaas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> But you know once more, Mr Botha was here to testify and this was never put to him, why wasn't it done?</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> May I just ask you, you're in prison at the moment, aren't you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Where are you being kept in custody?</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Johannesburg prison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Yes, and your lawyer, does he also live in Johannesburg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And I take it you've had ample opportunity to consult properly before this hearing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, just a matter of record, Mr Samuel doesn't live in Johannesburg, he's a local attorney.</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Oh I beg your pardon, Mr Chairman.  May I rephrase the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a>	Would you say you've had ample time to prepare properly and to consult with your lawyer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> No, the first time I saw him was when I arrived here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> That was in September last year I think.</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> But you've had the opportunity to listen to the evidence and from time to time you had instructed him as to what he was going to, what he should say and what he should put to the witnesses?</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> No, I did not have that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUEL:</span> If I may just place on record at this point time, Mr Chairman, the only occasions we had to consult was when Mr Mbane was here and even during the tea and lunch break we would never have that opportunity, because he had to go and find food and we never proper opportunities to consult.  So in my argument I will raise the points of the discrepancies as to why I did not put certain versions to the witnesses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you, Mr Samuel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Yes, thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a>	But you see, Mr Mbane, it actually goes further than that, it's not a problem of not having put certain versions, it's a situation where things apparently were put wrongly to some witness, and I'll show you later.</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a>	When Mr Kubheka became suspicious, will you just tell us what ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You mean Ms Kubheka.</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> ... Ms Kubheka became suspicious, what gave you the impression that she was becoming suspicious about this particular operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> First of all she asked about those three people that she handed over to us, she wanted to see at least one of them and she told us that there are other people who came but she wants to see at least one of those three.</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Yes.  You see I find this very interesting, that's what you testified yesterday as well, that she wanted to enquire about those three people.  Now will you just have a look at the record, the same thing is being referred to on various occasions, just look at page 1768, it's the first paragraph there</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a>"CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR SAMUEL"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a>I'll just read it to you.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a>"Mr Botha, Jimmy, my client will say that the reason why you asked for Ntombi to be brought to you was that he had informed you that Ntombi was becoming suspicious about the two persons that had requested him to find safe-houses for and she had always informed him that the Commander of those two persons was in Durban, and he wanted to see them, and this was reported to you by Jimmy."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a>Do you agree with this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> No, I disagree with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Did you hear your attorney putting this to Mr Botha?</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I cannot remember.  It might be that he asked him, but I can't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Yes, and just look at page 1821 of the same record, and I'll read it to you once again.  It's one again Mr Samuel, he puts it to Mr du Preez, the following version, he says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a>" And he will say also that the reason why Ms Kubheka was specifically asked to be brought to Mr Botha and yourselves, was that Ms Kubheka had informed him that there was a handler or a Commander of two men and Ms Kubheka had handed off to Mr Mbane to find safe-houses for, and she wanted to see them and she was becoming suspicious."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a>So this is the second time that this was put to a different witness, that she was only becoming suspicious about two men.  Did you hear him doing this, putting it to the witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> It might happen that I heard him putting that question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> But if your version is correct, you must have realised immediately that he was making a mistake, isn't that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> As I have already said, I did not have enough time to consult with my lawyer, we would only see each other here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Yes, but I mean here he was making the mistake time and time again and after the first mistake you could have said to him, "Listen here, this is a mistake, please see to it that it is corrected", isn't that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I didn't think it that way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> You see, Mr Mbane, isn't the reason really that you in fact did tell your lawyer that it was only the two comrades that she was worried about and that he put it correctly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> No, that is not so, three people were handed over to us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And that the third person that you mentioned yesterday was never killed, because Mr Radebe never killed the third person, as you testified to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> As the person who was present I am saying that he was killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Yes, I'm not - we'll argue that particular point later, but I'm not going to go into that save but to say that obviously Mr Radebe denies that he committed this particular murder, but that doesn't form part and parcel of his amnesty application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a>	I want to get back to the substance of your instructions from your seniors, by whom were you given the instruction to approach Ms Kubheka?</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Are you referring to the first day, the first time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Sorry I should have confined this question to the period after she had become suspicious.</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> It was Mr Botha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, just repeat the question so it's clear, I'm now a little bit puzzled as to what you're asking.</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Sorry, Mr Chairman, maybe I was a bit unclear on this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a>	After Ms Kubheka had become suspicious you were given certain instructions, is that not so?  Is that not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> That is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Now by whom were these instructions given to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> It was Botha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Yes, and what did he tell you, what were you to do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> He told us to go and fetch her and take her to Battery Beach.  They then showed us the spot where we should stop there and the signal that I had to make when we got there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Yes, now I want you to give us a more detailed version as to what exactly happened.  When you got this instruction, did you then contact Ms Kubheka?</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> How did you contact her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Using the telephone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Did you phone her at her home or did you have a different contact number where you could leave a message for her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I don't know whether the number I had was the home number, but it is where I used to call her and find her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Yes and then you spoke to her on the phone, what did you tell her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I told her that we had to meet and I was unable to go to the house, so it would be better if we would meet somewhere, and then she said that she would take a taxi or a train, I'm not sure, and then we'd meet in the station.</p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Yes, but did you indicate to her as to why you had to meet her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I just told her that it was dangerous for us to go in and out of her place, so it would be better if she met us somewhere, and she came.</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> The question was, did you give her a reason for the meeting?  In other words, what was it that you wanted to meet her about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> We would not discuss that over the telephone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Did you in any event tell her that you would arrive at the station in a motor vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, I think I told her, if I can still remember well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And you said to her that you would be driving a Corolla?</p>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I don't think I mentioned the type of a car, but I said that I would be driving a car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And I might be mistaken when I made the notes yesterday, was there a conversation about the fact as to what she would be wearing that particular day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I cannot remember, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I can recall a note to that effect as well, Mr Hugo, that there was some mention of what she would be wearing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> That's my recollection, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But sitting here I can recall that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Yes.  Now if the Chairman is correct and I'm also correct, what was the arrangement, was she supposed to tell you what she was wearing, or would be wearing that particular day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I think she told me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Yes.  What did she tell you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> A floral dress and a jersey.  I can't remember clearly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Mr Chairman, I see it's quarter past eleven already, may this be an ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, we'll take the tea adjournment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a><span class="speaker">FRANK XHOLA MBANE:</span> (s.u.o.)</p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Mr Chairperson, if I could just intervene at this stage, with a little bit of information that might assist.  The family have advised me two things today, we've managed to trace the passport of the deceased's mother in this matter and this Ms Maria Kubheka, and she was in Zambia and she returned on the 10th of May 1997, and we are confident that the deceased in this matter went missing  after that date, sometime soon after that date.  So we're pretty ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So it was definitely not before that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Ja, definitely not before that date.  And just for the record, it might become useful, this person is now deceased but her height as given by the passport, is 1,63 metres.</p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a>	The second bit of information that I have is from the sister of Mr Sbu Phewa, who also disappeared in this matter ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, if you could just mention that name again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> The sister of Mr Sbu Phewa, it's Ms Phewa ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Oh is that the sister of Sbu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes.  Now she has confirmed that Mr Phewa disappeared on the 19th of May 1987, and the reason she recalls this is because he had a child on the following day and he disappeared the day prior to the birth of that child.</p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That's the sort of date that one would imagine would be recollected.</p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Be remembered, yes.  Thank you, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  So that would also then indicate that Ms Kubheka, on the evidence that we've heard, taking the sequence that has been outlined, at least by Mr Mbane and also Mr Radebe, that she died after Sbu, well after Sbu disappeared, sorry.  After Sbu disappeared.  So it would seem that it was maybe even after the 19th of May that that occurred.</p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes.  Thank you, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Mr Hugo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR HUGO:</span> (Cont)</p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a>	Mr Mbane, just before the tea break I asked you about the clothing aspect and I'm not sure now as to what your evidence is.  Initially you couldn't remember that there was an agreement that she would be wearing a specific outfit and then when we had a look at our notes and the Chairman said that he had notes to the effect that you did have an arrangement that she would be wearing a specific outfit, you changed your tune a little bit, are you now sure that there was a specific agreement that she would be wearing a specific outfit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I cannot remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> But I thought you said, you told this Committee that she actually said to you that she would be wearing a floral dress etcetera, and you gave a description as to what she would be wearing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I don't remember clearly, I just thought that she might have said that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> May I ask you, why, if there was an arrangement like that, what was the reason for such an arrangement?  Why did you have to arrange with her to wear a specific outfit when she went to the railway station?</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I don't think it's a question of arranging for her to wear a specific outfit, but why would it have been necessary for her to inform you what she would have been wearing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Yes, thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> You see let me put it to you, I cannot see any reason as to why this was necessary, in the sense that you had meetings with her, you knew exactly what she looked like and you also testified that she was a big woman, so on the probabilities, in my mind there was absolutely no necessity for such an arrangement to be made.  You would have recognised her immediately at the station, is that not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> That is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Yes.  When you arrived at the station, were you driving the vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, I was driving.</p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And if I recall your evidence correctly, you were then also driving the vehicle when you went to Battery Bay, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And is it also correct that when you arrived there, you actually gave a signal by pressing the brakes two or three times, so that the white policemen could see that you had now arrived at Battery Bay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And I take you're absolutely sure of this particular fact, the fact that you drove the vehicle and you gave the signal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Now will you just please go to page 1718 of the record.  Before we have a look at the record, can you just tell us if you were the driver, who sat next to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> It was Dube.</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And behind you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Simon Radebe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And in the rear left passenger's seat?</p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Ntombi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And you're absolutely sure and convinced of these facts?</p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> What I know is that Dube was next to me and Simon Radebe was on the back seat, whether he was directly behind or on the other side, I'm not sure, but I know that he was on the back seat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> One fact that is very clear in your mind though, is that you were the driver?</p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Now would you just look at page 1718 of the record, right at the bottom, once again it's Mr Samuel and he puts the following to Mr Botha</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a>"He will state that Mr Radebe was driving the car and Mr Dube was seated in the front passenger's seat."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I don't know how this happened, because I was the driver and I'm the one who made the signal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Yes.  And then just once more look at the record, page 2024.  Maybe before we go over to the next reference in the record, page 1719, you don't have to look at it, I'll just read it to you.  Mr Samuel also then says that he, being you, will also state that he was present in the back seat of the car with Ntombi.  What do you say about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> What I know is that I was the driver of that car and I'm the one who made the signals, so I can't understand how I could make the signal being on the back seat of the car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Yes.  Will you please go to page 2024 of the record, it's two-thirds down the page, it's Mr Samuel and he says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a>"He will also tell the Commission that in fact he was not driving the motor vehicle, but rather Mr Radebe was driving the motor vehicle on the day in question and even at the time when they arrived at Battery Beach."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a>Is this once more wrong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, it is wrong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> You see what I don't understand is, you were sitting next to Mr Samuel when these things were put to the various witnesses and you must have realised that wrong facts are being put to the witnesses, is that not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> That is so, but then it didn't happen that way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Well what I want to know is, why didn't you correct him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line546"><a name="pos546"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I did not think about doing that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> You see it's even stranger to me is that I noticed yesterday that you're quite assertive, in that when Mr Samuel concluded your evidence-in-chief, you actually stopped him and you switched on the microphone again and you said to this Panel there's further evidence that you want to lead, can you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line548"><a name="pos548"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> The operation at Battery Beach, what time did that take place, more-or-less, the time of the day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> It was dark at that time, I think it was about seven.</p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Yes.  And I don't want to go into unnecessary details here, but you then went to Winkelspruit, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And you were driving the vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Which vehicle is this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Corolla.</p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, did you have a driver's licence, Mr Mbane, or did you at that time have a driver's licence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Did you have any other kind of driving permit, other than an ordinary licence?  I mean for example, some people if they work in the Police or the Defence Force, they sometimes get a permit within that context, to drive vehicles.</p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> No, I did not have a permit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Mr Mbane, was there any particular reason why Mr Radebe didn't drive, because apparently the vehicle was allocated to him?  Or a vehicle was allocated to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I was the one who used to drive the Corolla ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> On that, you had given the impression to Ms Kubheka that Radebe was your transport man, your driver right from the beginning, why now dispel that image that you've created about Radebe being the driver, by you driving yourself, especially when you don't even have a driver's licence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> We used to go to visit her without Radebe, so that was not the first time that I was driving.</p>
<p class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Hugo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line566"><a name="pos566"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a>	So when you arrived at Winkelspruit, what was the time then more-or-less?</p>
<p class="line" id="line568"><a name="pos568"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I cannot remember the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Can't you even say whether it was 6 o'clock, 8 o'clock or 10 o'clock?</p>
<p class="line" id="line570"><a name="pos570"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> It was dark, but I cannot remember what time it was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mbane, after Ms Kubheka was taken by the other policemen at Battery Beach, out of your car and put into their kombi, in your evidence-in-chief you said that they then went off and you waited a while in your car and then you drove to Winkelspruit, now for approximately how long did you wait at Battery Beach after the others had left, before you went to Winkelspruit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I think it was five to ten minutes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Five or ten minutes.  And then did you drive from Battery Beach directly to Winkelspruit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You didn't make any stops along the way, to buy food or drink or anything like that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> No, we didn't stop.</p>
<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So one would then imagine if, let's give it the top, ten minutes that you waited, it would have taken about another twenty/twenty five minutes to drive to Winkelspruit, more-or-less.</p>
<p class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So it would have been half an hour, forty minutes afterwards.  And you said it was about seven, it had just got dark, so we more-or-less know then it's seven to eight, eightish, somewhere around there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a>	And when you arrived at Winkelspruit, were there other vehicles parked there near the building?</p>
<p class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Can you just give us a description of the vehicles that were parked there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> The white men would come with their own cars, most of them owned cars and there were kombis, private cars and our kombi was also there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line585"><a name="pos585"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Yes, I'm actually more interested in the kombis.  How many kombis were parked there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line586"><a name="pos586"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> There was a panel van and our kombi, there was also another kombi, their kombi.  If I'm not mistaken I can say there were three or four.</p>
<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Kombis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line588"><a name="pos588"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, kombis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line589"><a name="pos589"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And how far were these kombis parked from the building where the interrogation took place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> They were parked opposite to the place where we were sleeping.</p>
<p class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Yes, but distance-wise, how far were they away from the building?</p>
<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Perhaps if you could indicate if you can recall, Mr Mbane, the closest one that was parked to the veranda where you eventually got to, how far would that have been from the veranda?  If you can indicate a distance in this room.</p>
<p class="line" id="line593"><a name="pos593"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I think eight to ten metres from where we were sleeping, from the veranda.</p>
<p class="line" id="line594"><a name="pos594"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> That was the one kombi, and the other ones, how far were they away?</p>
<p class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> All the cars were being parked on that area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line596"><a name="pos596"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And when you arrived there, what did you and Mr Radebe and Mr Dube do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line597"><a name="pos597"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> We got out of the car, we went to the veranda, we stayed there, we drank alcohol and they would come out of the room and ask us questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line598"><a name="pos598"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Did you at any stage get into one of the kombis during that evening, during the procedures that were taking place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line599"><a name="pos599"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> No, I cannot remember, but what I can still remember is that after some time, Simon Radebe is the one who went to the car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line600"><a name="pos600"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> No, but I'm interested in your situation, did you ever get into the kombi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line601"><a name="pos601"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I cannot remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line602"><a name="pos602"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Is it possible?</p>
<p class="line" id="line603"><a name="pos603"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, it is possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line604"><a name="pos604"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, when you say that you sat there and you were drinking alcohol, did you get under the influence of that alcohol?  Did you become drunk?</p>
<p class="line" id="line605"><a name="pos605"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> No, we did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line606"><a name="pos606"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Yes, that was my next question.  When you say "we were drinking, were you referring to yourself, Dube and Mr Radebe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line607"><a name="pos607"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line608"><a name="pos608"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> All three of you were drinking?</p>
<p class="line" id="line609"><a name="pos609"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Dube would drink occasionally, on certain times, he was not drinking like us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line610"><a name="pos610"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Ja, you see why I'm asking you is because there was evidence that Mr Dube had to drive the vehicle at one of the meetings with Ms Kubheka, just specifically for the reason that he didn't use alcohol, can you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line611"><a name="pos611"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I heard about that evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line612"><a name="pos612"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Now why would he then now all of a sudden start drinking at Winkelspruit in the presence of your seniors?</p>
<p class="line" id="line613"><a name="pos613"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Dube was drinking sometimes, but he was not drinking like we did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line614"><a name="pos614"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Well what do you mean, "he wasn't drinking like we did", were you drinking a lot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line615"><a name="pos615"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> He would drink occasionally.</p>
<p class="line" id="line616"><a name="pos616"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> No, this particular evening, how much were you drinking?</p>
<p class="line" id="line617"><a name="pos617"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> A few tots.</p>
<p class="line" id="line618"><a name="pos618"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> A few tots of what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line619"><a name="pos619"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Whisky.</p>
<p class="line" id="line620"><a name="pos620"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And where did this come from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line621"><a name="pos621"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> In our base there was alcohol all the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line622"><a name="pos622"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And  would you say that Mr Radebe was intoxicated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line623"><a name="pos623"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line624"><a name="pos624"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line625"><a name="pos625"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line626"><a name="pos626"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> But one thing however is clear, that you can vividly recall that the three of you were at the veranda and you were drinking?</p>
<p class="line" id="line627"><a name="pos627"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line628"><a name="pos628"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Let me just put it to you that this was once more never put to any of the other witnesses.  It was never put to Mr Radebe, he never had the opportunity to respond to that.  Why was this not done?</p>
<p class="line" id="line629"><a name="pos629"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line630"><a name="pos630"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And what's more, it doesn't appear in your statement, is there any reason as to why you didn't mention it in your statement?  I'm referring to your statement in volume 1 on page 128.</p>
<p class="line" id="line631"><a name="pos631"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Maybe it is something that I just didn't mention.</p>
<p class="line" id="line632"><a name="pos632"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> How long did the interrogation last for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line633"><a name="pos633"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I think an hour, or an hour to two hours.</p>
<p class="line" id="line634"><a name="pos634"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And at what stage did Mr Radebe get into the kombi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line635"><a name="pos635"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> We were drinking and then he said that he was tired, he went to the kombi as he was sleeping there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line636"><a name="pos636"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But I think, after the interrogation started, could you give an estimate, you said that lasted one to two hours, how long was Mr Radebe there with you on the veranda while the interrogation was taking place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line637"><a name="pos637"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I think it was thirty to forty five minutes after the interrogation had started.</p>
<p class="line" id="line638"><a name="pos638"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And you then afterwards went to sleep and you slept there on the veranda, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line639"><a name="pos639"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Dube and I slept there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line640"><a name="pos640"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And you had been drinking and I take it you slept well and you were fast asleep?</p>
<p class="line" id="line641"><a name="pos641"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> We were drinking, but we were not drunk.</p>
<p class="line" id="line642"><a name="pos642"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> At what stage did you go to sleep, actual sleep?</p>
<p class="line" id="line643"><a name="pos643"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> After the cars had left with the body we slept, after all of them together with Miyeza, after they left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line644"><a name="pos644"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Yes.  You heard Mr Radebe saying that he then left for CR Swart and that's where he spent the night, isn't it possible that whilst you were asleep that he might have departed with the kombi and gone to CR Swart without you having noticed that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line645"><a name="pos645"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> That is not so, that is not true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line646"><a name="pos646"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And why are you saying it's not true?</p>
<p class="line" id="line647"><a name="pos647"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, Mr Hugo, just to correct the record, he did concede at a later stage under questioning from myself that it might have been the next morning that he left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line648"><a name="pos648"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Yes, that is indeed so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line649"><a name="pos649"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So I wouldn't be too firm on this issue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line650"><a name="pos650"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Yes, thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line651"><a name="pos651"></a>	Be that as it may, is it correct that you then at some stage said to Mr Radebe that you heard that Ms Kubheka died of a heart attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line652"><a name="pos652"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, I'm the one who told Simon, because at that time he was already in the car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line653"><a name="pos653"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And were you then on your way to CR Swart?</p>
<p class="line" id="line654"><a name="pos654"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> No, we were still there in the base when I told him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line655"><a name="pos655"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Yes and then just one final aspect that I want to get clarity on, after this operation how many days did you spend here in Durban before you went back to Vlakplaas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line656"><a name="pos656"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Two or three days.</p>
<p class="line" id="line657"><a name="pos657"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Let me, just for completeness sake, put it to you that Mr Radebe said he was the driver of the vehicle when you met Ms Kubheka at the railway station and when she was taken to Battery Beach, are you still adamant that he's wrong and you're right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line658"><a name="pos658"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> What I'm saying is that I was the driver of the car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line659"><a name="pos659"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> And you heard Mr Radebe saying that he never heard any screams during this interrogation, are you still of the opinion that he must have heard her screaming?</p>
<p class="line" id="line660"><a name="pos660"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> He must have heard the screams.</p>
<p class="line" id="line661"><a name="pos661"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line662"><a name="pos662"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR HUGO</p>
<p class="line" id="line663"><a name="pos663"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you, Mr Hugo.  Mr Nel, do you have any questions that you'd like to put?</p>
<p class="line" id="line664"><a name="pos664"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR NEL:</span> Yes, thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line665"><a name="pos665"></a>	Mr Mbane, am I correct in saying from your evidence and from your answers to various questions, that it's clear that Mr Taylor was never at Battery Beach?</p>
<p class="line" id="line666"><a name="pos666"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Can you please repeat your question, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line667"><a name="pos667"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Well let me make it simple, was Mr Taylor during this operation, at Battery Beach when you were there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line668"><a name="pos668"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> No, he was not there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line669"><a name="pos669"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Do I understand you correctly when you said that Mr Botha was in charge of this operation, referring to the Ntombi Kubheka operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line670"><a name="pos670"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line671"><a name="pos671"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> So would it then be incorrect if anybody else, in notes or in a statement taken from you or in a conversation that you had with anybody, would have noted down that Taylor went to the beach?</p>
<p class="line" id="line672"><a name="pos672"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> That is not true, he was not there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line673"><a name="pos673"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Why I'm asking you this, I want to refer you to page 2 of Exhibit J, apparently the notes taken by Capt de Jongh.  It says there, and this was quoted to you earlier on, the top sentence, first sentence</p>

<p class="line" id="line675"><a name="pos675"></a>then the important paragraph says:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line676"><a name="pos676"></a>"Dube and I (loosely translated) left her at the beach in the car.  Taylor and the other whites came with a kombi."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line677"><a name="pos677"></a>You say this is incorrect?</p>
<p class="line" id="line678"><a name="pos678"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, it is incorrect, Taylor was not there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line679"><a name="pos679"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> So if these notes were taken down by Capt de Jongh and he had an interview with you whilst doing so, he would have made a mistake or he would suck this out of his thumb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line680"><a name="pos680"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, because this is not true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line681"><a name="pos681"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> How did you see the late Col Taylor's role in this operation?  How do you see it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line682"><a name="pos682"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Taylor was there as the overall Commander, the Commander of this mission was Botha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line683"><a name="pos683"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> So Taylor was overall in command and Botha was in charge of this operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line684"><a name="pos684"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line685"><a name="pos685"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> If I refer you to your statement on page 131 of bundle 2, can you comment on this last sentence on paragraph 44</p>

<p class="line" id="line687"><a name="pos687"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> As I have already said, Taylor was the overall Commander, so he is the one who paid us this money.  The Commander of the mission was Mr Botha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line688"><a name="pos688"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> That is not what you said just now, Mr Mbane, I asked you who was in charge of the operation and you said Mr Botha, yet in this sentence you say</p>

<p class="line" id="line690"><a name="pos690"></a>forget about the R7 000 for the minute, why do you say that in your statement, or is this incorrect?  Specifically:</p>

<p class="line" id="line692"><a name="pos692"></a>the last sentence of paragraph 44.</p>
<p class="line" id="line693"><a name="pos693"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> What I know is that Taylor was in charge.  The person that was in charge was Botha, Taylor was the overall Commander.</p>
<p class="line" id="line694"><a name="pos694"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> It's for that very reason ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line695"><a name="pos695"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> But he is the one who paid us money.</p>
<p class="line" id="line696"><a name="pos696"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> It's for that very reason, if you know that Taylor is not in charge of this operation, why do you state that in your statement made?</p>
<p class="line" id="line697"><a name="pos697"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> It might happen that that was a mistake.</p>
<p class="line" id="line698"><a name="pos698"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> I see.  When you arrived at Winkelspruit, have I got the sequence correctly saying that you arrived there, you then went to the veranda, you started drinking, Ms Kubheka's body was removed and then you went to sleep, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line699"><a name="pos699"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line700"><a name="pos700"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Now at what stage of this sequence did Mr Miyeza arrive at Winkelspruit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line701"><a name="pos701"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Mr Miyeza arrived after Ms Kubheka had died, he went in and he spoke with the seniors.  From there the body was wrapped and they left and I also slept, because I was sleeping there in the veranda.</p>
<p class="line" id="line702"><a name="pos702"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry Mr Nel, if I may just intervene before it slips my mind.</p>
<p class="line" id="line703"><a name="pos703"></a>	Was there a telephone at Winkelspruit, there at the shooting range?</p>
<p class="line" id="line704"><a name="pos704"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> No, we would use public phones and we'd go to the post office to phone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line705"><a name="pos705"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So did you know how it came about that Mr Miyeza arrived, or do you think it was just by coincidence that he pitched up at that time, or do you think somebody called him to come?</p>
<p class="line" id="line706"><a name="pos706"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I don't know, I only saw him when he arrived.  Maybe they used radios to call him, but I'm not sure, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line707"><a name="pos707"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you see any vehicles leaving that place, from the time that you knew that the deceased was dead and the time of Mr Miyeza's arrival?</p>
<p class="line" id="line708"><a name="pos708"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I cannot remember that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line709"><a name="pos709"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Mr Nel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line710"><a name="pos710"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line711"><a name="pos711"></a>	When Miyeza arrived at Winkelspruit, were you or were you not already aware of the fact that Ms Kubheka had died?</p>
<p class="line" id="line712"><a name="pos712"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, we were aware.</p>
<p class="line" id="line713"><a name="pos713"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> How did you become aware of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line714"><a name="pos714"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> We were told that she had already died due to her attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line715"><a name="pos715"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> And how long after that did Miyeza arrive?</p>
<p class="line" id="line716"><a name="pos716"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I think it was an hour or less than an hour.</p>
<p class="line" id="line717"><a name="pos717"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> And when he arrived, what did he do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line718"><a name="pos718"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> He passed us, he greeted us and he went to that room where Ms Kubheka was interrogated.  I don't know what he did when he arrived there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line719"><a name="pos719"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Were you and Dube still drinking then or were you already in bed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line720"><a name="pos720"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> We were just sitting there, I was just drinking.</p>
<p class="line" id="line721"><a name="pos721"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> So Miyeza went into the room leaving you outside?</p>
<p class="line" id="line722"><a name="pos722"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line723"><a name="pos723"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> And then what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line724"><a name="pos724"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> After some time one car reversed, they then put the body, Miyeza went out and the white men followed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line725"><a name="pos725"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Who are these white men?</p>
<p class="line" id="line726"><a name="pos726"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> As I have already said it was Lawrie and the other one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line727"><a name="pos727"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think it was Mr Visser who was cross-examining you, determined it was Mr Wasserman and du Preez, he said the two that were recalled.</p>
<p class="line" id="line728"><a name="pos728"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> So it was Mr Miyeza - let me rephrase that, the motor vehicle was reversed close to the door, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line729"><a name="pos729"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, close to the door.</p>
<p class="line" id="line730"><a name="pos730"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> And then what did you see?</p>
<p class="line" id="line731"><a name="pos731"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I saw a wrapped body and we already knew who that person was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line732"><a name="pos732"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, Mr Nel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line733"><a name="pos733"></a>	Were the lights on when the body was being placed in the vehicle?  When I say the lights, the lights on at the veranda in the rooms there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line734"><a name="pos734"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> There were no lights, we were using batteries.  There was no electricity.</p>
<p class="line" id="line735"><a name="pos735"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> So the body - sorry, Mr Chairperson, can I proceed?  When the body came out of the room it was already wrapped?</p>
<p class="line" id="line736"><a name="pos736"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line737"><a name="pos737"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> You didn't see it being wrapped?</p>
<p class="line" id="line738"><a name="pos738"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> No, I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line739"><a name="pos739"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> And it was brought out by Mr Miyeza, Mr Lawrie who we know is Wasserman, and the person who testified, Mr du Preez?</p>
<p class="line" id="line740"><a name="pos740"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line741"><a name="pos741"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> And the three of them then put the body into this vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line742"><a name="pos742"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Now we know that you had difficulty in remembering what type of vehicle this was, but in fact, was it a kombi or was it a Skyline?</p>
<p class="line" id="line743"><a name="pos743"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I cannot remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line744"><a name="pos744"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> You were watching this all the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line745"><a name="pos745"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> It's not that I concentrated on that, but I was there on the veranda, sitting there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line746"><a name="pos746"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Once the body was loaded into the vehicle, who drove off, of the three persons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line747"><a name="pos747"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I do not know, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line748"><a name="pos748"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Alright, tell us what happened, what did you see?</p>
<p class="line" id="line749"><a name="pos749"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> After that we were just there, sitting there and Radebe was already in the car, so we prepared to sleep in the veranda.</p>
<p class="line" id="line750"><a name="pos750"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Did you see the vehicle with the body leave Winkelspruit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line751"><a name="pos751"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line752"><a name="pos752"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> And what else did you see?</p>
<p class="line" id="line753"><a name="pos753"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I cannot remember ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line754"><a name="pos754"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What do you want him to tell us, whether he saw the stars or the lamp pole across the street, or?</p>
<p class="line" id="line755"><a name="pos755"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line756"><a name="pos756"></a>	Did you see the persons getting into the vehicle and drive off with it, or did you just see the vehicle leave?</p>
<p class="line" id="line757"><a name="pos757"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I just saw the vehicle leave.</p>
<p class="line" id="line758"><a name="pos758"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Did you see any other vehicles leave?</p>
<p class="line" id="line759"><a name="pos759"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> As I already said, there used to be cars all the time there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line760"><a name="pos760"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> My question was did you see any other vehicles leave when the vehicle with the body left?</p>
<p class="line" id="line761"><a name="pos761"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Miyeza's car drove off and then after that the second car followed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line762"><a name="pos762"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Where was Mr Coetzer at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line763"><a name="pos763"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> He was there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line764"><a name="pos764"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Well where was he, what was he doing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line765"><a name="pos765"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I don't know what he was doing but he was there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line766"><a name="pos766"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> He was there, but you don't know what he was doing, was that because you didn't see him?  Was that the reason for not knowing what he was doing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line767"><a name="pos767"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> He was there but I don't know what he was doing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line768"><a name="pos768"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Is the reason that you don't know what he was doing because  you didn't see him, but you knew he was there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line769"><a name="pos769"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I saw him, but I don't know what he was doing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line770"><a name="pos770"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Well Mr Mbane, let's get straight to the point, you say in your statement</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line771"><a name="pos771"></a>"Her body was taken out by Miyeza, Lawrie and Coetzer."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line772"><a name="pos772"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Could you give us a reference to that please, Mr Nel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line773"><a name="pos773"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairperson, that's the same paragraph, paragraph 44 on page 131, bundle 2.</p>
<p class="line" id="line774"><a name="pos774"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line775"><a name="pos775"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Do you see that, Mr Mbane?</p>
<p class="line" id="line776"><a name="pos776"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line777"><a name="pos777"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> What is your comment on that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line778"><a name="pos778"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> It might happen that there's a mistake again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line779"><a name="pos779"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Well did Mr Samuel make the same mistake on page 2163 of the record, when he put it to Mr Baker</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line780"><a name="pos780"></a>"Mr Jimmy Mbane will say ..."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line781"><a name="pos781"></a>Sorry Mr Chairperson, 2163 of the record, three-quarter way down the page.  Mr Samuel put it to Mr Baker:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line782"><a name="pos782"></a>"Mr Jimmy Mbane will say that Mr Miyeza, Mr Lawrie and Mr Coetzer, in fact had removed this body from the base."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line783"><a name="pos783"></a>Is that also a mistake?</p>
<p class="line" id="line784"><a name="pos784"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, that is also wrong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line785"><a name="pos785"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> I don't want to follow the line of questioning of my colleagues, but you heard Mr Samuel putting this to the witnesses and in fact he put it to other witnesses as well, you did not correct it, is there any reason why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line786"><a name="pos786"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> There is no reason.</p>
<p class="line" id="line787"><a name="pos787"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> In fact, you say on page 1825, once again Mr Samuel put it to, this time another witness, Mr du Preez</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line788"><a name="pos788"></a>"Mr Mbane will say ..."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line789"><a name="pos789"></a>on page 1825 of the record:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line790"><a name="pos790"></a>"Mr Mbane will say that he was present when the body was removed from the room and put into the motor vehicle, do you recall that?"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line791"><a name="pos791"></a>then he goes on and says:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line792"><a name="pos792"></a>"Or he was able to see when the body was removed from the room and put into the motor vehicle."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line793"><a name="pos793"></a>Is that correct what your attorney put to the witness, Mr du Preez?</p>
<p class="line" id="line794"><a name="pos794"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I was present when the body was put in the car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line795"><a name="pos795"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> And yet you say it's a mistake when you say in your statement that Mr Coetzer was present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line796"><a name="pos796"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> It might happen that it is a mistake.</p>
<p class="line" id="line797"><a name="pos797"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> How big was this body to your recollection, Mr Mbane?</p>
<p class="line" id="line798"><a name="pos798"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> It was quite big.</p>
<p class="line" id="line799"><a name="pos799"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It's a very difficult question to answer, Mr Nel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line800"><a name="pos800"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> I will rephrase that ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line801"><a name="pos801"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you want dimensions or what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line802"><a name="pos802"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Was this body big enough to fit into a Nissan Skyline, in the boot of a Nissan Skyline, according to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line803"><a name="pos803"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> The body did fit in that boot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line804"><a name="pos804"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Well once again on page 1830 of the record, Mr Samuel put it to Mr du Preez that</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line805"><a name="pos805"></a>"Mr Mbane will say that he looked at the body and it would have been virtually impossible because of the size of the body, to put it into a Nissan Skyline, the boot especially of a Nissan Skyline."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line806"><a name="pos806"></a>According to what I can remember I have already mentioned that I cannot remember whether it was a kombi or the Skyline.</p>
<p class="line" id="line807"><a name="pos807"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But you take what Mr Nel has just read to you now, Mr Mbane, and this was put by Mr Samuel to Mr du Preez when Mr du Preez was given evidence and he says, this is what Mr Samuel says to Mr du Preez, that you</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line808"><a name="pos808"></a>"Mr Mbane will say that he looked at the body and it would have been virtually impossible because of the size of the body, to put it into a Nissan Skyline boot."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line809"><a name="pos809"></a>Now forget whether it was a kombi or that, what is your comment on that actual statement, did you tell Mr Samuel that the body was too big for a Nissan Skyline boot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line810"><a name="pos810"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line811"><a name="pos811"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Then why have you now just conceded that it could have fitted into the boot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line812"><a name="pos812"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> Can you please repeat your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line813"><a name="pos813"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Why have you now just conceded and agreed with the statement that it would have fitted into the boot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line814"><a name="pos814"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I don't understand your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line815"><a name="pos815"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Well you've just agreed with the Chairperson that you told Mr Samuel that the body wouldn't have fitted into the boot, however a few minutes ago, Mr Nel asked you "Would the body have fitted into the boot?"  You said "Yes."  Do you understand?</p>
<p class="line" id="line816"><a name="pos816"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, I understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line817"><a name="pos817"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So we're asking you to explain why you agreed with Mr Nel when you had already told Mr Samuel that it couldn't possibly fit in the boot.  Did you just forget that you told him that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line818"><a name="pos818"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> It might happen that I've forgotten.</p>
<p class="line" id="line819"><a name="pos819"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And also, Mr Mbane, hasn't the Skyline got quite a big boot?  A Skyline is one of the bigger Nissan models.</p>
<p class="line" id="line820"><a name="pos820"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, it's got a bigger boot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line821"><a name="pos821"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Nel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line822"><a name="pos822"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Just to get back for a second, Mr Mbane, to when the vehicle with the body left, are you able to say whether Mr Miyeza left with that vehicle or did he leave in a separate vehicle?  I'm not too clear on what you said on that point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line823"><a name="pos823"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> He left with the car that he came with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line824"><a name="pos824"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> And that's not the same car carrying the body of Ms Kubheka?</p>
<p class="line" id="line825"><a name="pos825"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> No.</p>

<p class="line" id="line827"><a name="pos827"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> If I can still remember well, Miyeza left first and then the second car followed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line828"><a name="pos828"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Now I might have my notes wrong, but didn't you say yesterday that Miyeza followed the white man's car?</p>

<p class="line" id="line830"><a name="pos830"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Mr Chairman, perhaps I could just be corrected on that, I seem to have in my notes that Miyeza followed the white man's car.  He specifically said the white men's car.  And as I say my apologies if I'm incorrect, that is how I noted it down.</p>

<p class="line" id="line832"><a name="pos832"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Mr Chairperson, maybe I can assist, I can recall clearly that he said that Miyeza left first.</p>
<p class="line" id="line833"><a name="pos833"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUEL:</span> According to my notes he says one car followed the other, meaning that Miyeza was in front of the other car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line834"><a name="pos834"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you say "one car followed the other", then it could mean either one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line835"><a name="pos835"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUEL:</span> No, he indicated, the way I understand the evidence was, Miyeza left first and then the car with the body followed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line836"><a name="pos836"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> This is my note, I'll read it here.  "We were surprised.  They went in and out of the room.  After some time Miyeza arrived.  He spoke with the whites.  Simon went to the kombi, Dube and I were on the veranda.  Saw deceased being dragged on a blanket, put in a car.  Car drove off and Miyeza followed in a car.  Are you confusing this with another incident?  This was the first operation, etcetera, etcetera."  That's my note.</p>

<p class="line" id="line840"><a name="pos840"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I know that when, I think, Mr Visser was cross-examining he did say that Miyeza left first, but this is the notes of his evidence-in-chief.</p>
<p class="line" id="line841"><a name="pos841"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Yes, in your evidence-in-chief you said, which we've established now, that the vehicle carrying the body left first and that Miyeza followed the white man's car, is that incorrect?  Or did you make a mistake yesterday?</p>
<p class="line" id="line842"><a name="pos842"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> It was Miyeza who left first.</p>
<p class="line" id="line843"><a name="pos843"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Are we quite sure now or are you quite sure now today as you sit here, that the three persons that took the body from the room was Miyeza, Mr du Preez and Mr Wasserman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line844"><a name="pos844"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line845"><a name="pos845"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> So once again if somebody would take notes of an apparent conversation, would it be incorrect if it states the following, and I'm referring you once again to Exhibit J, page 2 in the middle of the page where you say, or where it is said</p>

<p class="line" id="line850"><a name="pos850"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, it is incorrect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line851"><a name="pos851"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> So if Capt de Jongh took these notes in a conversation with you and he kept these notes, then once again he must have thought this up by himself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line852"><a name="pos852"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> What is written there is incorrect and all my statements are written in English.</p>
<p class="line" id="line853"><a name="pos853"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> What was the normal amount of remuneration that you would have received for an operation of this nature, if any?</p>
<p class="line" id="line854"><a name="pos854"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> It would depend on the kind of operation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line855"><a name="pos855"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Did you hear the evidence of Mr Botha in-chief, which we find on page 1725 of the record, in the middle of the page where Mr Samuel asked him about the R7 000 payment allegedly paid to you by Taylor, where he said that</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line856"><a name="pos856"></a>"Rewards of R7 000 were not paid out because the highest amount that could be paid out which could be approved by Security Head Office, was R2 500 per arrested terrorist.  That was the maximum amount for such a person."</blockquote>

<p class="line" id="line859"><a name="pos859"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, in any event even on the evidence that we've heard here there was more than one person arrested, we've heard of Sbu, we've heard of the chap at the false roadblock and then, although it's disputed, a third one and then also the deceased.  So that would, if it was R2 500 per head ...</p>

<p class="line" id="line864"><a name="pos864"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I said I cannot remember unless if I read my statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line865"><a name="pos865"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you come down to Durban -  we know that this you said was your first operation in Durban and in your career did you have occasion to come to Durban on other occasions?</p>

<p class="line" id="line867"><a name="pos867"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> And how well did you know Mr Miyeza?</p>
<p class="line" id="line868"><a name="pos868"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I know him, he even knows where I stay in Britz.</p>
<p class="line" id="line869"><a name="pos869"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> At the time of this operation as this was your first time in Durban, was that the first time that you met Mr Miyeza?</p>
<p class="line" id="line870"><a name="pos870"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, at that time I did not know him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line871"><a name="pos871"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> You did not know him, that was the first time that you met him, here in Durban?</p>
<p class="line" id="line872"><a name="pos872"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I cannot remember whether that was the first time we knew each other.</p>
<p class="line" id="line873"><a name="pos873"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Well, before this operation, had you been to Durban?</p>
<p class="line" id="line874"><a name="pos874"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> As I have already said, if I can read my statements they can refresh my memory.</p>
<p class="line" id="line875"><a name="pos875"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Well Mr Mbane, I think it's clear that this was your first operation in Durban, or am I incorrect?</p>
<p class="line" id="line876"><a name="pos876"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, it might be so, I think that was the first time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line877"><a name="pos877"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I got the clear impression yesterday when you were testifying, Mr Mbane, that this was your first operation, because you went on to say your second one was in Josini and you had no hesitation at all in being adamant that this was your first one, now you're not sure, what is the position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line878"><a name="pos878"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> In Durban it was my first operation, this one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line879"><a name="pos879"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> You hadn't met Mr Miyeza perhaps on holiday prior to this operation in Durban?</p>
<p class="line" id="line880"><a name="pos880"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I can't remember coming to Durban on holidays.</p>
<p class="line" id="line881"><a name="pos881"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> So the point I'm trying to make is, when you came to Durban on this operation, seeing that was the first time that you knew or met Mr Miyeza, you didn't know him well at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line882"><a name="pos882"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I cannot remember because they used to go to Vlakplaas sometimes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line883"><a name="pos883"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Well Mr Mbane, are you now saying that you met Mr Mbane at Vlakplaas prior to this operation?  Sorry, Mr Miyeza.</p>
<p class="line" id="line884"><a name="pos884"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> What I'm saying is it might happen that we met in Vlakplaas.  I'm not saying it is like that, I'm saying it might be so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line885"><a name="pos885"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Well I don't want to flog a dead horse, but is it then incorrect that you met him in Durban for the first time as you've stated?</p>

<p class="line" id="line887"><a name="pos887"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> So we can forget about the possibility that you might have met him at Vlakplaas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line888"><a name="pos888"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> We can put it the way that will satisfy you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line889"><a name="pos889"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Thank you for that, Mr Mbane.  What I want to put to you in conclusion is that Mr Miyeza was never at this operation, he was never at Winkelspruit and didn't take part in the removal of this body at all, and that you are making a mistake like the various other mistakes that seems to be made by you here.  What is your comment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line890"><a name="pos890"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> What do you want me to say that will satisfy you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line891"><a name="pos891"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> I would enjoy is it you say "yes", Mr Mbane, but that's up to you, whatever you want to say you can tell this Commission.</p>

<p class="line" id="line905"><a name="pos905"></a>	Mr Mbane, as I understand this operation and it's clear from the affidavit and the evidence of, I think it was Col Baker, that Mr Botha, Capt Botha was in charge of the operation involving Ntombi Kubheka.</p>
<p class="line" id="line906"><a name="pos906"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> That is correct.</p>

<p class="line" id="line911"><a name="pos911"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Col Baker's statement.  I think it's page 107 of the bundle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line912"><a name="pos912"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That's volume 1.</p>
<p class="line" id="line913"><a name="pos913"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Sorry, it's 108 of volume 1.</p>

<p class="line" id="line916"><a name="pos916"></a>CHAIRPERSON</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line917"><a name="pos917"></a>"The team fell under the command of Capt H Botha and Gen Steyn."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line918"><a name="pos918"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> So if my understanding is correct ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line919"><a name="pos919"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well Mr Chairman, that doesn't say what my learned friend is putting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line920"><a name="pos920"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, it doesn't necessarily say of this particular operation, but they were the general command.  But in any event I think it's clear from the evidence of Mr Mbane, when being cross-examined, that he considered Capt Botha as being in charge of the operation, under the overall command of Taylor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line921"><a name="pos921"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes and I also just would like to record that this is the aspect of Baker's application where he's specifically referring to Kubheka incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line922"><a name="pos922"></a>	In any event, even though you were under the command of - you fell under the Vlakplaas operatives, your activities were controlled by Col Botha who was from the Security Branch in Durban?</p>
<p class="line" id="line923"><a name="pos923"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line924"><a name="pos924"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> So you weren't receiving orders from Vlakplaas operatives, basically your orders were emanating from the Durban Security Branch and specifically Botha?</p>
<p class="line" id="line925"><a name="pos925"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line926"><a name="pos926"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Now you've given evidence to the effect that the purpose of your operation on the day that Kubheka was arrested, was in fact to deliver her to your white superiors, whether that's Botha or Taylor, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line927"><a name="pos927"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line928"><a name="pos928"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> So when you woke up that morning and you contacted Kubheka, you were under no illusions as to what your purpose that day was, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line929"><a name="pos929"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line930"><a name="pos930"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And your purpose was specifically to arrest Kubheka, that's your evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line931"><a name="pos931"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line932"><a name="pos932"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And you did that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line933"><a name="pos933"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, we did that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line934"><a name="pos934"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And you delivered Kubheka to the place at Battery Beach that was prearranged with, obviously with your superiors and there were white people there, including Botha?</p>
<p class="line" id="line935"><a name="pos935"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line936"><a name="pos936"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Now it's clear, I think it's common cause in fact, from the evidence of the applicants that you were driving the Toyota Corolla vehicle, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line937"><a name="pos937"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, not from the applicants, because we've had that statement that was read out in which it was said that Radebe was driving.</p>
<p class="line" id="line938"><a name="pos938"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> I'm sorry, well I'm just ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line939"><a name="pos939"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Just to clarify, it's only Radebe who says he was driving.</p>
<p class="line" id="line940"><a name="pos940"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes, well let me just be clearer on that.  You were driving a Corolla motor vehicle, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line941"><a name="pos941"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line942"><a name="pos942"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And this had tinted windows, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line943"><a name="pos943"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line944"><a name="pos944"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And from that I understand that any signal that you could give, it wouldn't be the sort of signal that you would give by hand from the interior of the motor vehicle because the windows were tinted, you couldn't see that from outside, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line945"><a name="pos945"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, you could not see.</p>
<p class="line" id="line946"><a name="pos946"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> So it seems that only one of two things could have been done, either you would have had to wind down the windows, or you would have had to give some sort of signal which was indicative from the outside of the vehicle, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line947"><a name="pos947"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line948"><a name="pos948"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And your recollection of that signal is that you pressed the brake pedals three times, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line949"><a name="pos949"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, that is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line950"><a name="pos950"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And Mr Botha recalls, and I refer to page 1661 of the evidence ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line951"><a name="pos951"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry what's that page again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line952"><a name="pos952"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> 1661.</p>
<p class="line" id="line953"><a name="pos953"></a>	... that the signal was to flash the indicator lights.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line954"><a name="pos954"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> The signal was to press the brakes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line955"><a name="pos955"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes, Mr Botha said he wasn't sure, but that's what he thought.  Now it seems that if that was the signal that you were given that you had to give, then it would seem to indicate that you'd have to be driving the vehicle in order to give that signal, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line956"><a name="pos956"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> That is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line957"><a name="pos957"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Now how long had you been acting as an askari prior to this incident, and I'm not confining you to Natal, I'm asking you about generally?</p>
<p class="line" id="line958"><a name="pos958"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I was arrested in 1983 and I started working at about August 1983.  I was arrested in February 1983 and then the same year, August, I started working until 1992.</p>
<p class="line" id="line959"><a name="pos959"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> I'm sorry, I'm not sure, from August?</p>
<p class="line" id="line960"><a name="pos960"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, he said he was arrested in February 1983 and then he became operative as an askari in August 1983 and he carried that through to 1992.</p>
<p class="line" id="line961"><a name="pos961"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Oh thank you, thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line962"><a name="pos962"></a>	So by the time you got involved in this operation you had at least three and a half to four years experience?</p>
<p class="line" id="line963"><a name="pos963"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line964"><a name="pos964"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Now it seems to me that under those circumstances if you'd made a mistake or if you hadn't performed your function according to the plan, you wouldn't have given the signal as you gave on that day, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line965"><a name="pos965"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> That is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line966"><a name="pos966"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> So if you'd arrested the wrong person, it seems to me strange that you would drive that person all the way to the correct spot and you'd give the signal as determined, not so, you wouldn't have acted in that way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line967"><a name="pos967"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, I wouldn't have acted that way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line968"><a name="pos968"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> It seems to me that in likelihood what you would have done is you would have communicated with your superiors beforehand and said "Look, let's not blow this whole operation, the matter hasn't really worked out as planned, so I'm not in a position to deliver this person", and you would have taken further instructions on what to do with the Kubheka woman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line969"><a name="pos969"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I would go to the place, the Battery Beach and then get out of the car and go to them and tell them that I did not bring the person they asked me to fetch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line970"><a name="pos970"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Thank you.  But in this instance you gave the signal because as far as you were concerned you'd done exactly what you'd been asked to do, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line971"><a name="pos971"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> That is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line972"><a name="pos972"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Now Mr Botha has alleged, and some of his co-applicants, all his co-applicants except Mr Radebe have alleged that, have suggested that your order was to pick up the leader of a guerrilla movement on that day, somebody I think coming from Zambia, but not Ms Kubheka, did you ever get an instruction to that effect?</p>
<p class="line" id="line973"><a name="pos973"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> No, I did not get such instructions, I was only told about Ms Kubheka.</p>
<p class="line" id="line974"><a name="pos974"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes, and if I can just refer you to the evidence of, or should I say the statement of Mr de Kock that day, it seems to support what he says.  If you can just bear with me, Mr Chairperson.  I'm referring to a translation that I've had done of de Kock's statement and it appears at I think page, it commences at page 112 of the second bundle.  Sorry, no it doesn't Mr Chairperson, it commences at 11 - yes, 112.</p>
<p class="line" id="line975"><a name="pos975"></a>	Now according to Mr de Kock, the information he got from Coetzer - and Mr Chairman, you'll have to excuse me, I've got a translation, it's not an official translation but I know it's accurate, but I haven't numbered it, it hasn't been numbered according to the paragraphs, but it looks like about ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line976"><a name="pos976"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that where it says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line977"><a name="pos977"></a>"About two or three days later"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line978"><a name="pos978"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> I think it's 3.2.2, the last sentence, or I'm concentrating on that paragraph.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line979"><a name="pos979"></a>"The operation was the infiltration of an ANC cell.  According to Joe (and that's Coetzer he's referring to), the leader of the cell was a woman.  The cell was active in the area."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line980"><a name="pos980"></a>Now were you under the impression that the deceased, Ms Kubheka, was the leader of this ANC cell that was operating in that area at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line981"><a name="pos981"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I thought it that way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line982"><a name="pos982"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> So this information that Mr, or it was Maj de Kock at that time, this is accurate, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line983"><a name="pos983"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, that is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line984"><a name="pos984"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Now he goes on to say, and I'm referring to the paragraph 3.2.4 I think, Mr Chairperson, that, and he's reporting on a conversation that he'd had with Joe Coetzer, a discussion regarding the female leader and there's no data as to who this would be, and Mr de Kock says that Coetzer informed him that Hentie, which is obviously Botha, Capt Botha intended to murder the black woman that evening.  Now what I want to ask you, was it your belief that possibly that night Ms Kubheka could be murdered?</p>
<p class="line" id="line985"><a name="pos985"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I don't know whether she was supposed to be killed.  What I knew is that they said that they wanted her to show them those four comrades.</p>
<p class="line" id="line986"><a name="pos986"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Now if she didn't give the information as regards exactly where those four comrades were, surely in your past experience, and I think it's quite clear that the possibility exists that she would have been killed that night, she didn't cooperate with the interrogation, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line987"><a name="pos987"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, that is right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line988"><a name="pos988"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What is the value Chairperson, of putting argument to a witness and getting him to agree ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line989"><a name="pos989"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, this is essentially argument, we're not going to be putting too much weight on what Mr Mbane is going to say to you, it is essentially argument.</p>
<p class="line" id="line990"><a name="pos990"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> As you please, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line991"><a name="pos991"></a>	Now you had direct dealings with Mr Coetzer, not so?  During the time of this operation, he was there for quite a considerable amount of the time.  In fact, he replaced Mr Ras when I believe Mr Ras I injured, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line992"><a name="pos992"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, that is correct, but I was reporting to Radebe and Radebe would report to Coetzer and Coetzer would report to Botha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line993"><a name="pos993"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, but the question was, did you have direct dealings with Coetzer yourself, without a third person between you?  When you were in Durban at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line994"><a name="pos994"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, sometimes we would work directly with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line995"><a name="pos995"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Now Coetzer says in his affidavit, and I'm referring to paragraph of his statement which I think is at page ...(intervention)</p>

<p class="line" id="line997"><a name="pos997"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> ... volume 2 again, page 102, and I want to know if he ever discussed this with you personally.  He said that he was informed by one of the members of the Security Branch that the leader of the ANC cell which had been infiltrated by Jimmy Mbane, was a woman.  Now what ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line998"><a name="pos998"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just for the record, that's paragraph 7 on page 102.</p>
<p class="line" id="line999"><a name="pos999"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1000"><a name="pos1000"></a>	Now what I want to ask you is the thing that he says next and I want to know, did he discuss this with you, did he discuss this that the plan was to interrogate her?  Did you discuss this plan to interrogate Kubheka, with Coetzer at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1001"><a name="pos1001"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> No, I did not discuss it with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1002"><a name="pos1002"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> He then explains that ... sorry, I didn't get that translation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1003"><a name="pos1003"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That the plan was for him to question her or to interrogate her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1004"><a name="pos1004"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> His answer was that he didn't discuss that with Coetzer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1005"><a name="pos1005"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Oh yes.  Sorry, I thought you meant the translation of the rest of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1006"><a name="pos1006"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Now he goes on to say that in order to do this</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1007"><a name="pos1007"></a>"Jimmy Mbane tried to lure her on the pretext to take her to a place, on a pretext to a place where we would arrest her."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1008"><a name="pos1008"></a>Did Coetzer discuss this with you, the fact that he wanted you to go and lure this person to this place, lure Kubheka to this place where she could be arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1009"><a name="pos1009"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> No, I cannot remember discussing such a thing with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1010"><a name="pos1010"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> But to you mind even if it wasn't discussed directly with you, this reflects an accurate position as to what the plan was, is that correct?  i.e. That you'd lure her to a place so that she would be arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1011"><a name="pos1011"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, this happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1012"><a name="pos1012"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Just turning to the actual interrogation itself or the torture itself, I just want to get information on the timing of this.  You arrived obviously some time later than the persons who transported Ms Kubheka to Winkelspruit, now from the time that you arrived, you've indicated that you heard her screaming, now how long would you estimate that this torture went on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1013"><a name="pos1013"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I think it was an hour to two hours.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1014"><a name="pos1014"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And in your view, did you gain the impression that she was being put considerable pain?  From what you heard from the veranda.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1015"><a name="pos1015"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, because she was screaming that meant that she was in pain.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1016"><a name="pos1016"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> If you'd just bear with me, Mr Chairperson.  Mr Chairperson, I wonder if I could ask for an indulgence at this stage.  I know it's rather macabre, but I require that, or I request that the clothing be brought back into the ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1017"><a name="pos1017"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Certainly, if that's what you want Mr Wills.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1018"><a name="pos1018"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1019"><a name="pos1019"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is it available, Ms Thabethe, the clothing?  Do you need anything more than the dress, Mr Wills?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1020"><a name="pos1020"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> No, the dress will be fine, thank you Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1021"><a name="pos1021"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1022"><a name="pos1022"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Now do you remember, does this dress in any way remind you of what you saw Ms Kubheka wearing on that day?  Or can't you remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1023"><a name="pos1023"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> What I can see is that this is a small size for her.  I can't remember whether this is the dress of not, but what I can say is that this is a small size.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1024"><a name="pos1024"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Thank you.  Mr Chairperson, possibly I can use this opportunity to compare the size of the dress with dresses that we have obtained from the family at this stage.  Thank you.  Could I ask that the dresses of the family, that the family have supplied as belonging to Ms Kubheka, be placed next to this dress.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1025"><a name="pos1025"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, you can lead evidence later where the dresses actually come from.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1026"><a name="pos1026"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes, I will be leading that evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1027"><a name="pos1027"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We won't accept this as evidence, but if it's a convenient stage we can do so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1028"><a name="pos1028"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1029"><a name="pos1029"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, just one point Mr Wills.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1030"><a name="pos1030"></a>	Mr Mbane, when you saw Ms Kubheka that day, when you picked her up at the station, the dress she seemed to be wearing, did it seem to be sitting well on her?  Did it look normal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1031"><a name="pos1031"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1032"><a name="pos1032"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> She wasn't wearing a dress that was obviously too tight or one that was too big for her as far as you're concerned, it just looked normal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1033"><a name="pos1033"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, it was normal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1034"><a name="pos1034"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Mr Chairperson, just for the record, I will be leading evidence of the son of the deceased that the two dresses that are about to be shown to the Committee, are in fact the dresses of the deceased person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1035"><a name="pos1035"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you, Mr Wills.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1036"><a name="pos1036"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> I think Mr Chairperson, for ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1037"><a name="pos1037"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Please correct me if I'm wrong.  We now have two additional dresses that have been laid on the floor alongside Exhibit 1.  The one dress is, one could perhaps describe it as a black dress, it's got a pattern on it, but it's essentially a black dress, and the other one is a blue dress.  If one takes a look from the bottom of the hem line to the shoulder as they are lying here, they're all pretty much of the same length, there's no real discernible difference.  As they are lying here they seem to be the same length.  With regard to waist size, my opinion is the blue one seems to have a slightly thicker waist than the Exhibit 1 and then - sorry, they're actually being put next to each other, the waistline.  Ms Miller, what is the, are they similar?  Are they the same?  They look the same.  The black one and Exhibit 1, the waistline is essentially the same, if there's a difference it's a question of millimetres perhaps.  The blue one looks a little bit wider perhaps.  Yes, perhaps a little bit wider because it seems to be dropping a little bit down, but if it is wider it's a centimetre or so in it.  I think at this stage, although they haven't been handed in as evidence yet, just for convenience we can call the black one Exhibit 3, seeing that there is going to be evidence about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1038"><a name="pos1038"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Exhibit 5.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1039"><a name="pos1039"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry 5.  Of course we had the slip and the underwear, yes.  Exhibit 5 is the black dress and Exhibit 6 will be the blue dress.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1040"><a name="pos1040"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1041"><a name="pos1041"></a>	Mr Mbane, I want you to look at Exhibit 5 and 6 and tell me whether or not in your view, those dresses would fit the deceased in this matter, according to your recollection.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1042"><a name="pos1042"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I can say so, but I am not sure, but I think they would have fitted her as I'm looking at them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1043"><a name="pos1043"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairperson, I've no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1044"><a name="pos1044"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR WILLS</p>
<p class="line" id="line1045"><a name="pos1045"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Unless anybody else wants it, I'm happy that the exhibits be returned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1046"><a name="pos1046"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes I'm going to just ask any of the other persons at the end of the round, whether they want to ask any</p>
<p class="line" id="line1047"><a name="pos1047"></a>questions regarding these other dresses to Mr Mbane, seeing that that has been brought in at this stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1048"><a name="pos1048"></a>	Ms Thabethe, do you have any questions you'd like to put to Mr Mbane?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1049"><a name="pos1049"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS THABETHE:</span> Yes Mr Chair, I do thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1050"><a name="pos1050"></a>	Mr Mbane, yesterday afternoon I also had an opportunity of speaking to Mrs Dludla the neighbour about the dress and she seemed to indicate that it's the dress that Ntombi Kubheka was wearing on that day, what would be your response to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1051"><a name="pos1051"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You're talking about Exhibit 1?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1052"><a name="pos1052"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Exhibit 1.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1053"><a name="pos1053"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> As I have already mentioned that I cannot remember what she was wearing, so I cannot agree or disagree with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1054"><a name="pos1054"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> You've indicated in your evidence that at some stage you went to Ntombi's house at KwaMashu, when you were there was there anybody else present in the house besides her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1055"><a name="pos1055"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well that would be besides the people that you went with.  Did you find any other people there or did any other people come there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1056"><a name="pos1056"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, sometimes we would find her with another lady, I think she was also staying nearby.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1057"><a name="pos1057"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Now I'm moving to Battery Beach.  When you arrived at Battery Beach, you indicated in your evidence that Dube and Radebe alighted, do you think the white superiors saw them getting off the car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1058"><a name="pos1058"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> They alighted before the car with the white men came.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1059"><a name="pos1059"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, you're talking at Battery Beach?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1060"><a name="pos1060"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> At Battery Beach, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1061"><a name="pos1061"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So when you got to Battery Beach you were the first one to get there, your vehicle was the first of the police vehicles to get there, is that what you're saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1062"><a name="pos1062"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1063"><a name="pos1063"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Was Coetzer present during the abduction at Battery Beach?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1064"><a name="pos1064"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1065"><a name="pos1065"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Was Wasserman present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1066"><a name="pos1066"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, he was present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1067"><a name="pos1067"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> I'm moving now to Winkelspruit.  You have indicated that he heard her scream, was it like shouting or was it more of crying screams?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1068"><a name="pos1068"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Both, she did both.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1069"><a name="pos1069"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Could you hear the people who were interrogating her, what they were saying?  Could you hear what they were saying, what questions they were asking her? From where you were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1070"><a name="pos1070"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> ...(no interpretation)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1071"><a name="pos1071"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, we lost the interpretation.  The question was - if you could just repeat your answer please, Mr Mbane, the question was, could you hear what the people were saying in the room?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1072"><a name="pos1072"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> No, I could not hear but I could hear that they were talking to her, but I couldn't understand or hear what they were saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1073"><a name="pos1073"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Did you ever see Ms Kubheka at Winkelspruit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1074"><a name="pos1074"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> As they would open the door sometimes I would see her sitting down, when the door was opened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1075"><a name="pos1075"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Could you see whether she was bound?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1076"><a name="pos1076"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> Could you please repeat your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1077"><a name="pos1077"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Could you please repeat the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1078"><a name="pos1078"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Could you see whether she was bound, like her hands and her feet?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1079"><a name="pos1079"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1080"><a name="pos1080"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Were her hands bound?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1081"><a name="pos1081"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, they were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1082"><a name="pos1082"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> And her feet?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1083"><a name="pos1083"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Her hands were bound and she was blindfolded.  I cannot remember about the feet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1084"><a name="pos1084"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Before this incident occurred where were you sleeping?   Were you sleeping at CR Swart or at Winkelspruit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1085"><a name="pos1085"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> At Winkelspruit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1086"><a name="pos1086"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(indistinct) from the evidence, Ms Thabethe, they were sleeping in both places but they moved, according to Mr Mbane, from CR Swart to Winkelspruit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1087"><a name="pos1087"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Now in your evidence you had indicated that you were asked to hand over the MK operatives that were introduced to you by Ntombi Kubheka, why do you think they had to be handed over to them?  Were any reasons advanced why you had to hand them over to your superiors?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1088"><a name="pos1088"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> The reason was because when we gave them reports they told us to come with those people and they will see what to do, so we were following orders.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1089"><a name="pos1089"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Thank you, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1090"><a name="pos1090"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS THABETHE</p>
<p class="line" id="line1091"><a name="pos1091"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you, Ms Thabethe.  Before I ask you to re-examine, Mr Samuel, I'm just going to ask if anybody has any</p>
<p class="line" id="line1092"><a name="pos1092"></a>questions to put to Mr Mbane concerning Exhibits 4 and 5 that have been introduced.  Mr Visser?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1093"><a name="pos1093"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Chairperson, I don't have questions on the exhibits, a new piece of evidence has been introduced and I would ask you to ask very brief question or two about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1094"><a name="pos1094"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1095"><a name="pos1095"></a><span class="speaker">FURTHER CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR VISSER:</span> Mr Mbane, I listened very carefully to your evidence yesterday and today and I want to put to you that this is the first time that you say, that you stated in your evidence that when the door was opened you saw Kubheka in the storeroom, am I correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1096"><a name="pos1096"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, I can hear you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1097"><a name="pos1097"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> So if this happened, why didn't you tell us about this before?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1098"><a name="pos1098"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> It is because you did not ask me that question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1099"><a name="pos1099"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Your lawyer was leading your evidence, your lawyer was leading your evidence, Mr Mbane, why didn't you tell us that you could see inside the storeroom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1100"><a name="pos1100"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> When the door would be opened and closed again, when it was opened I could see inside because I was in the veranda.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1101"><a name="pos1101"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Why didn't you tell the Committee that yesterday or today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1102"><a name="pos1102"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUEL:</span> Mr Chairman, I believe that when I put Mr Mbane's version to the other witness, Mr Botha, I did indicate that when the doors were opened he had seen ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1103"><a name="pos1103"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, but the question is why didn't he say it when he was testifying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1104"><a name="pos1104"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Really Mr Chairman, my learned friend should think before he objects, because that's not what I'm putting to the witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1105"><a name="pos1105"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUEL:</span> Sorry Mr Chairman, I did not raise an objection, I just mentioned that ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1106"><a name="pos1106"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Why didn't you tell us about that, Mr Mbane?  In fact, can I tell you what you said?  When you were asked about whether you could see inside the storeroom you said you could not see inside the storeroom.  That was your answer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1107"><a name="pos1107"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I could only see when the door was opened because I was sitting in the veranda.  The door would be opened and then closed again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1108"><a name="pos1108"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> In fact here is the question that your lawyer put to you</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1109"><a name="pos1109"></a>"Could you see inside the room?"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1110"><a name="pos1110"></a>answer:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1111"><a name="pos1111"></a>"No, I did not see her."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1112"><a name="pos1112"></a>That's it, you didn't qualify it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1113"><a name="pos1113"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I could not see when the door was closed, but I could only see when the door was opened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1114"><a name="pos1114"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who can see through a closed door unless it's made of glass?  We know it's not made of glass, it's made of wood, so why do you say that you didn't anything through the door because you can't see when the door is closed?  It doesn't make sense.  And if you were there and the door was closed and opening and you from time to time could see in the room, then you would say you could see in the room from time to time.  Your answer wouldn't be "I couldn't see in the room when the door was closed", when you can see when it was open.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1115"><a name="pos1115"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> It didn't come to my mind to answer it that way.  I apologise.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1116"><a name="pos1116"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I just want to put it to you, Mr Wasserman was not present at Battery Beach where Kubheka was arrested, abducted.  Lawrie wasn't there.  I put it to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1117"><a name="pos1117"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I am saying that he was there and you are saying that he was not there, so who is correct between me and you?  I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1118"><a name="pos1118"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well I will make certain submissions on your credibility, Mr Mbane.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1119"><a name="pos1119"></a>	Thank you, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1120"><a name="pos1120"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR VISSER</p>

<p class="line" id="line1127"><a name="pos1127"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ms Thabethe, you didn't want to ask anything about the clothes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1128"><a name="pos1128"></a>NO QUESTIONS BY MS THABETHE</p>
<p class="line" id="line1129"><a name="pos1129"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Any re-examination, Mr Samuel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1130"><a name="pos1130"></a><span class="speaker">RE-EXAMINATION BY MR SAMUEL:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1131"><a name="pos1131"></a>	Mr Mbane, you were asked in regard to Mr Miyeza, the Committee wanted to know in what possible way Mr Miyeza could have been contacted to come over and I just want to ask you a question on that.  Do you recall what vehicle Mr Miyeza came in on that day, was it a State vehicle or was it his private vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1132"><a name="pos1132"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> It was the State vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1133"><a name="pos1133"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUEL:</span> Would that vehicle have a radio in it, a police radio of some sort?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1134"><a name="pos1134"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I cannot remember because I did not go and look, but most of the State cars have a radio.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1135"><a name="pos1135"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry Mr Samuel, if I could just ask on this.  When you say it was a State vehicle, was it a police van with a badge on the side, B number plates?  When you say it was a State vehicle, could you, or was it an ordinary looking vehicle without police number plates and without markings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1136"><a name="pos1136"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> It was not marked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1137"><a name="pos1137"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So how did you know it was a State vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1138"><a name="pos1138"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Because I used to see that car after that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1139"><a name="pos1139"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you.  Mr Samuel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1140"><a name="pos1140"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUEL:</span> But you confirm that in all probability there would have been a police radio in that vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1141"><a name="pos1141"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> That's what I think.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1142"><a name="pos1142"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUEL:</span> Now in regard to the lighting at this place here in Winkelspruit, you told this Commission that there was no electricity there, they used batteries, battery power, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1143"><a name="pos1143"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1144"><a name="pos1144"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUEL:</span> Do you recall whether they had lights, whether powered by battery or otherwise, on the day in question when Ms Kubheka died?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1145"><a name="pos1145"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> We were using batteries as lights.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1146"><a name="pos1146"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUEL:</span> I see.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1147"><a name="pos1147"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, just on that, when you say you were using batteries, were these little hand torches, or did you have big lamps that ran off car batteries?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1148"><a name="pos1148"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> We were using motor batteries.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1149"><a name="pos1149"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUEL:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1150"><a name="pos1150"></a>	And you can recall that the lights were on on the day in question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1151"><a name="pos1151"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1152"><a name="pos1152"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUEL:</span> So your visibility so far as darkness was concerned, there was no darkness, you could see what was going on around you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1153"><a name="pos1153"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> There were places that were dark, but we were there was light.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1154"><a name="pos1154"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUEL:</span> So it was easy for you to see a body being removed from the room that it was placed in, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1155"><a name="pos1155"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1156"><a name="pos1156"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUEL:</span> Right.  You were asked by Mr Nel about Mr Coetzer, now you knew that Mr Coetzer was at Winkelspruit on the night in question, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1157"><a name="pos1157"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1158"><a name="pos1158"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUEL:</span> Was there any need for you to take particular attention of his activities ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1159"><a name="pos1159"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry Mr Samuel, as I said to Mr Hugo, I know this is re-examination but the value of questions where you lead the witness completely is not much use to anybody.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1160"><a name="pos1160"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUEL:</span> I'll leave that for argument.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1161"><a name="pos1161"></a>	Now Sir, you mentioned during cross-examination that the body of Ms Kubheka fitted in a boot, as far as you were concerned you could see it being fitted in a boot, am I right?  - of a motor vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1162"><a name="pos1162"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1163"><a name="pos1163"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Chairperson, that's entirely an incorrect statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1164"><a name="pos1164"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Because he said he didn't know whether it was in a kombi or a car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1165"><a name="pos1165"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> A kombi or a - yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1166"><a name="pos1166"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUEL:</span> May I just rephrase that question.  Do you know, have you any recollection whether that body was placed in a Nissan Skyline on the night in question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1167"><a name="pos1167"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I cannot remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1168"><a name="pos1168"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUEL:</span> I see.  But from where you stood you were able to see that that body was placed in a vehicle without any difficulty, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1169"><a name="pos1169"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1170"><a name="pos1170"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUEL:</span> Now, much was made about the statements that you had made, you had made two statements or basically one statement which appears in bundle 1 from page 122 to page 131 and in the additional bundle, bundle 2, from 120 to 137, which statement you had confirmed.  Now what was your reason for giving those statements?  Was it because you just wanted to give a general outline of the incidents that you were involved in?  Would I be correct in saying that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1171"><a name="pos1171"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> It is because I wanted to free my conscience by giving out these statements concerning the things ...(end of tape 2 side A)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1172"><a name="pos1172"></a>	... of these people could be able to know what happened to their people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1173"><a name="pos1173"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUEL:</span> Now when those statements were taken, do you recall who took down those statements, or did you write out those statements?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1174"><a name="pos1174"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> There are a lot of people who used to come to me and to write down statements.  I cannot remember them all, but what I can still remember is that the person who wrote this statement, the person that I approached was John from Durban, but I don't know where in Durban.  But it was John.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1175"><a name="pos1175"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who was John, was he a friend of yours or was he a policeman or a lawyer or?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1176"><a name="pos1176"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> A member of the TRC staff.  He is the person that I approached and I told him that I wanted to write a statement concerning what happened in KwaMashu.  But others used to come to me for statements, but the main person that I spoke to about what happened was this John.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1177"><a name="pos1177"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUEL:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1178"><a name="pos1178"></a>	Were these statements ever read back to you at any stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1179"><a name="pos1179"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Some of the statements I don't remember it being read back because some of them would just write down, but there are other statements that are read out after making the statements, because some people would come and I would give them  a statement and then I would never see them again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1180"><a name="pos1180"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry Mr Samuel, I thought when he was giving evidence-in-chief he confirmed these statements, he said there were the two and they were basically the same and he confirmed them, now what are you trying to do, are you trying to un-confirm what's been confirmed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1181"><a name="pos1181"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUEL:</span> No, no, no, I did mention that he had confirmed them when I just outlined, when I came to ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1182"><a name="pos1182"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> One would imagine that the way it was said - it's just an impression, I might be wrong, that was how his evidence was started, "you've made two statements, they appear here and they appear there, they essentially the same, do you confirm them?"  That those would have been the statements which were used in the consultations, the basis for consultation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1183"><a name="pos1183"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUEL:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1184"><a name="pos1184"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And if they weren't read to him at the time of being taken, then before he made that statement any discrepancies would have been picked up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1185"><a name="pos1185"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUEL:</span> Yes, but I just wanted - my next question will clarify the entire ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1186"><a name="pos1186"></a>	Is it not true that your evidence-in-chief today went into some detail, it added to these statements, am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1187"><a name="pos1187"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1188"><a name="pos1188"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUEL:</span> I see.  Now Sir, tell me, do you have any grievance against any of your colleagues while you were at Winkelspruit or while you were operating in Durban?  Do you have any axe to grind with them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1189"><a name="pos1189"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> No, I do not have any grievances.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1190"><a name="pos1190"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUEL:</span> Will you have any reason to lie to this Commission in regard to their activities?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1191"><a name="pos1191"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> No, I don't have any reasons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1192"><a name="pos1192"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUEL:</span> Thank you.  Now if as Mr Botha says in his evidence that you were asked to bring some other person other than Ms Kubheka to them, were you ever reprimanded for any mistakes in regard to whom you brought to see your white handlers?  That you brought the wrong person and you messed up the entire investigation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1193"><a name="pos1193"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> This issue about bringing the wrong person, it is the first time I hear about it here.  This is the first time I hear about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1194"><a name="pos1194"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But the question was, were you ever reprimanded for bringing the deceased to them at Battery Beach?  That's the question.  Did you get into trouble about it, were you reprimanded for doing it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1195"><a name="pos1195"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Because I did not bring any wrong person, so I was never reprimanded about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1196"><a name="pos1196"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUEL:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1197"><a name="pos1197"></a>	Sir, is it correct that the previous four consultations between yourself and me was restricted to the time that we met at the TRC hearings, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1198"><a name="pos1198"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1199"><a name="pos1199"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Does that include the whole of Tuesday?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1200"><a name="pos1200"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUEL:</span> No, Mr Chairman, because he ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1201"><a name="pos1201"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Because we did not sit on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1202"><a name="pos1202"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUEL:</span> We did not sit on Tuesday, but till that time.  Thank you.  No further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1203"><a name="pos1203"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR SAMUEL</p>
<p class="line" id="line1204"><a name="pos1204"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Mr Lax, any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1205"><a name="pos1205"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Thank you, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1206"><a name="pos1206"></a>	Mr Mbane, you were positioned on the veranda at Winkelspruit and you say that you could hear people talking inside and you couldn't discern exactly what they were saying, but you could hear voices talking and you say that you could hear Ms Kubheka crying and screaming, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1207"><a name="pos1207"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1208"><a name="pos1208"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Could you hear any other noises besides that, any other sounds?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1209"><a name="pos1209"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I cannot remember hearing any other sound.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1210"><a name="pos1210"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You see there's some evidence that Ms Kubheka was being hit with a plastic object, or a rubber hose of some description, or a sjambok-like object and there were sounds of those hits that could be heard outside the building.  There's evidence of that.  If you were on the veranda you would have heard those sounds.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1211"><a name="pos1211"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> What I could hear was her screams and voice of people that were talking inside, that is what I heard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1212"><a name="pos1212"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So you didn't hear thuds of someone being struck?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1213"><a name="pos1213"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I cannot remember that, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1214"><a name="pos1214"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> If you'll just bear with me a moment, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1215"><a name="pos1215"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> While you're looking, perhaps I can ask.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1216"><a name="pos1216"></a>	You said that you, Mr Radebe and Mr Dube were sitting on the veranda drinking from the time that you arrived at Winkelspruit, and then as far as I can recall was what you did after Radebe had gone to the kombi you and Dube were still on the veranda and you were still drinking, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1217"><a name="pos1217"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1218"><a name="pos1218"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you were drinking for a fairly long period.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1219"><a name="pos1219"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1220"><a name="pos1220"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you were drinking whisky, straight?  Straight whisky or mixing it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1221"><a name="pos1221"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> We were mixing it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1222"><a name="pos1222"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And what sort of tots were you pouring?  Why I ask, I've heard of these police tots and Vlakplaas tots, that two fingers is like that and you pour the bottle and you count to three or four and then that's a tot.  Is that the sort of tots you were drinking or can you describe what you were drinking?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1223"><a name="pos1223"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I cannot remember Chairperson, but we were drinking because Dube was an occasional drinker, so I cannot remember whether we were using the Vlakplaas style or some other style.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1224"><a name="pos1224"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you can't say how much you drank that night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1225"><a name="pos1225"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> No, I can't say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1226"><a name="pos1226"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> On that, had you been drinking during the day as well or not at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1227"><a name="pos1227"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> No, we started drinking when we arrived at Winkelspruit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1228"><a name="pos1228"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Just while we're on this question of drinking, it seems as if you and Radebe and sometimes Dube, drank quite a lot, is that a fair thing to say?  Did you drink liquor often?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1229"><a name="pos1229"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, we would drink liquor often.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1230"><a name="pos1230"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You also said liquor was freely available at the camp.  Did you have to pay for it?  Who paid for that liquor?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1231"><a name="pos1231"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I don't know who paid for that liquor because food and liquor was there all the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1232"><a name="pos1232"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Did you drink often in duty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1233"><a name="pos1233"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> Can you please repeat the question, Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1234"><a name="pos1234"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Did you drink often on duty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1235"><a name="pos1235"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> We would drink on certain occasions when we were free, but when we were on duty we wouldn't be drunk but sometimes we'd drink.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1236"><a name="pos1236"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Now with regard to the period after Ms Kubheka died and her body was taken away you said you remained in the area for about three days and you were supposed to go back to the house to find out what was going on, but you decided you didn't want to do that.  Did I understand that part of your evidence correctly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1237"><a name="pos1237"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1238"><a name="pos1238"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And you said Joe wanted you to go back to the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1239"><a name="pos1239"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> If I can still remember well, Joe did not want me to go back there.  If I can still remember well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1240"><a name="pos1240"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Who gave you instructions to go back to the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1241"><a name="pos1241"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> It was the Commander of the operation, Botha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1242"><a name="pos1242"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> It was Botha.  Because that's more-or-less in line with what we understand about a dispute between Botha and Coetzer around you possibly going back to the house, but when you testified your evidence was that Coetzer was the one who said it.  I don't know whether you were making a mistake or not, but that was my clear recollection and my note, and that's why I'm canvassing this issue with you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1243"><a name="pos1243"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> If my memory serves me well, Botha wanted me to go back to that house, I reported to Coetzer that I did not want to go back there.  If I can still remember, because this, Chairperson, happened a long time ago.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1244"><a name="pos1244"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> My note, this is just my note of your evidence-in-chief, right at the end of it, "the next day we were told to remain there.  On second day told to go to D's(?) (that D is the deceased's house) by Coetzer.  I refused.  I phoned the house, a lady said the deceased was not there.  On the third day we went back to Vlakplaas.  That's Dube, Radebe and myself."</p>
<p class="line" id="line1245"><a name="pos1245"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1246"><a name="pos1246"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Maybe I made a mistake concerning the names when I was answering that question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1247"><a name="pos1247"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So you're sure it was Botha who wanted you to go there and you told Coetzer you didn't want to go there and then you phoned instead?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1248"><a name="pos1248"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, that is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1249"><a name="pos1249"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Are you able to recollect whether there was a dispute between Coetzer and Botha around this issue of you going back?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1250"><a name="pos1250"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, there was a dispute concerning that because one wanted me to go back and one did not want me to go back to that house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1251"><a name="pos1251"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Now just one last thing, this Gipsman that you worked with, this man with the plaster of paris on his leg, who was he, where was he from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1252"><a name="pos1252"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I don't know his name, but what I know is that he was trained and he was from outside, because I used to ask him questions about places in Angola and Zambia and he knew those places and he also knew the Camp Commanders of the camps there.  I don't know his real name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1253"><a name="pos1253"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If I could just ask a question on that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1254"><a name="pos1254"></a>	Was his leg injured or was he put in plaster to stop him from running away?  Or don't you know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1255"><a name="pos1255"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> He was put the plaster because they did not want him to run away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1256"><a name="pos1256"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So as far as you're aware he was a trained MK operative who'd been captured and was working with you, or co-operating at any rate in your activities, but because they weren't sure  about him they had his leg in plaster of paris?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1257"><a name="pos1257"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, they did not trust him at that time, but he was working with us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1258"><a name="pos1258"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And did you see that man again or work with him again at some other point?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1259"><a name="pos1259"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> No, I did not see him again after that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1260"><a name="pos1260"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Who was that man's handler?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1261"><a name="pos1261"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> It was Mr Botha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1262"><a name="pos1262"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Thanks Chair, I've no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1263"><a name="pos1263"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Adv Bosman, do you have any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1264"><a name="pos1264"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Thank you, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1265"><a name="pos1265"></a>	Mr Mbane, I just want to clear two matters with you.  Who did you regard as the leader of these four political activists with whom you had contact in this time?  Who did you think was the senior person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1266"><a name="pos1266"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> It is difficult to answer that question, Chairperson, because I cannot say that it was Ntombi who was the leader, but according to my perception, Ntombi was the sympathiser.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1267"><a name="pos1267"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> I seem to recall that at one stage you said that she was the leader, this is why I'm asking you this question, it wasn't quite clear to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1268"><a name="pos1268"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> You cannot be a leader without training, Chairperson.  You cannot lead the soldiers if you are not trained, so that is why I'm saying she was just sympathising with them, she was a sympathiser.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1269"><a name="pos1269"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Was this ever discussed with your seniors, exactly what her position was?  Did you ever discuss this with your white seniors?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1270"><a name="pos1270"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> What I know is that people from exile used to come to her and she would look for accommodation for those people and help them financially and her people were also in exile.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1271"><a name="pos1271"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Is this what you conveyed to your seniors, that she was just helping people to find accommodation, people from exile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1272"><a name="pos1272"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> This is what I saw, I perceived it that way because I could see that this person was not trained but she knew those people that were in exile.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1273"><a name="pos1273"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> No, but my question is, was this what you told your seniors?  Did you tell them this woman had no training, her only role is to provide people who come into the country with accommodation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1274"><a name="pos1274"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> No, I did not tell them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1275"><a name="pos1275"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think what Adv Bosman might be referring to is, we've had certain statements read out now by other applicants who, Baker et al, who say that she was the leader of the cell, do you know where they would have got that information from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1276"><a name="pos1276"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER MERWE:</span> Mr Chairman just for the record, it was Mr Wills who asked the question, it was Joe Coetzer and de Kock's statements.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1277"><a name="pos1277"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you, sorry Mr van der Merwe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1278"><a name="pos1278"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER MERWE:</span> Baker was not involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1279"><a name="pos1279"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1280"><a name="pos1280"></a>	Mr de Kock's statement and Mr Coetzer's statement which Mr Wills read out just now, they mention Ms Kubheka as being the leader of the cell, in their statements, where do you think they would have got that idea from?  Whether they were right or wrong, but where would they have got it in their head that Ms Kubheka was the leader of a cell?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1281"><a name="pos1281"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I don't know where they got that idea, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1282"><a name="pos1282"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Now who did you regard as the big fish?  You know there were a number of people there and you must have had conversations and discussions with them, who did you regard as the big fish?  The one who had to be sort of addressed first.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1283"><a name="pos1283"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I can say it was her because she was the one who knew where others were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1284"><a name="pos1284"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Okay now is this what you conveyed to your seniors, that this is the most important person with whom we are dealing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1285"><a name="pos1285"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> No, I did not tell them that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1286"><a name="pos1286"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> The second question which I need some clarity on, Mr Mbane, is it's not clear to me where Mr Radebe really featured in your operation.  From your evidence I gathered that you were the kingpin as it were, you were the important person in the operation, is that correct, or am I wrong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1287"><a name="pos1287"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1288"><a name="pos1288"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> You were the important one in your operation in dealing with these four activists?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1289"><a name="pos1289"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1290"><a name="pos1290"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Now what exactly was Mr Radebe's role, because he gave evidence that he was the senior person and that his role was that of the driver of a, generally your driver and he said a particular vehicle was allotted to him, allocated to him.  How did you see his role, what was he there for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1291"><a name="pos1291"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Radebe's role was to help us with transport and with money, so that is why a lot of times he would not be with us when we go there and sometimes he would be with us.  That is why we ended up getting this Corolla.  And he would not always be with us as he was the person who was helping us with transport and money.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1292"><a name="pos1292"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Who allocated the Corolla to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1293"><a name="pos1293"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Botha told us to go to CR Swart to get a car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1294"><a name="pos1294"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> And when you went to visit Ntombi's house, which vehicle did you use?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1295"><a name="pos1295"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> The first time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1296"><a name="pos1296"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> No - well yes, the first time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1297"><a name="pos1297"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> The first time we used the kombi.  Simon was driving and then he dropped us about a kilometre from that house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1298"><a name="pos1298"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> The subsequent visit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1299"><a name="pos1299"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Sometimes we would use a kombi and sometimes I would drive a Corolla.  I was the one who was driving the Corolla, even when we went to Sbu we were using the Corolla.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1300"><a name="pos1300"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Thank you.  Thank you, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1301"><a name="pos1301"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just one very quick question.  Why do you think Mr Radebe would have shot the person who was in the back of the vehicle when you were driving?  From what reason?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1302"><a name="pos1302"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> I don't know, Chairperson, because I was driving at that time, I was behind the steering wheel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1303"><a name="pos1303"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, but did you ask him, did you say to him "Well you know, what did you do that for?  Why did you shoot the person, we were taking him back like we've done with Sbu and we'd done with the other chap that we'd put at the roadblock, why do you go and kill this man now?"  Didn't you ask him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1304"><a name="pos1304"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> As my senior, Chairperson, I did not ask, I did not even think about asking him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1305"><a name="pos1305"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So as far as you were concerned you were driving a car with the idea of taking this person you had captured to your officers in charge, on the way without any explanation and completely against the plan, one of you shoots him through the head and you just dump the body at a hotel entrance and you say not a word, you don't question it at all?  You just raise no query.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1306"><a name="pos1306"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Chairperson, the way we operated, our job was to do what we were told to do and if you see others doing something else, you don't ask questions.  So as my senior, I just assumed that he knew what he was doing, so I did not ask him questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1307"><a name="pos1307"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, but you used to get drunk with Mr Radebe on duty, you got so drunk that you couldn't even go back to the base you had to sleep at the station, it wasn't a question of he's my officer, I can't say anything to him, you would get drunk together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1308"><a name="pos1308"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Chairperson, I can't remember being so drunk or Radebe being so drunk and not even being able to see the way back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1309"><a name="pos1309"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, are you saying that - well that hasn't been touched upon, you didn't sleep at the station because Mr Radebe was drunk and couldn't go back to Winkelspruit in case he was seen to be drunk?  Did you hear Mr Radebe's evidence about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1310"><a name="pos1310"></a><span class="speaker">MR MBANE:</span> Yes, I heard his evidence, but I can't remember sleeping at the station.  We used to sleep at the base.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1311"><a name="pos1311"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Any questions arising, Mr Samuel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1312"><a name="pos1312"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUEL:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1313"><a name="pos1313"></a>NO QUESTIONS BY MR SAMUEL</p>

<p class="line" id="line1330"><a name="pos1330"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, he's not an applicant, he's an implicated person.  Any objection to Mr Mbane being excused?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1331"><a name="pos1331"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> If he's keen to get back to jail, Chairperson, he's welcome.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1332"><a name="pos1332"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, you may be excused from further attendance, Mr Mbane.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1334"><a name="pos1334"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Samuel, you won't be leading any further witnesses will you?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1337"><a name="pos1337"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Thank you, Mr Chair.  I'm going to ask for a short adjournment because there are copies that I've made from the mortuary books.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1338"><a name="pos1338"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes certainly, and if you could let us know as soon as you're ready and then I think in the meantime if these dresses could be, well they're all exhibits now, just packed up into the plastic, that arrangements could be made for that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1339"><a name="pos1339"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> I'm sorry Mr Chairperson, I wonder, it may be convenient at this time, the family and Mr Mbane would like to have a discussion in the spirit of reconciliation, I wonder, before Mr Mbane's return to prison if that could possibly take place this afternoon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1340"><a name="pos1340"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, we can take an adjournment now.</p>
