Every vehicle that the group leader was responsible for, had a bag, a sail bag and normally this had two R1s with two magazines, two Browning rifles and SSG ammunition and then Uzi's had also been given to them, two Uzi's with four or five magazines each, two sets of handcuffs, between three and four feetcuffs, smoke teargas grenades had been given to them and then also flares and then we also gave them smoke grenades of different colours, if it would be necessary to call in the helicopter.
