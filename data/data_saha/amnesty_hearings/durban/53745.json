I spent most of my life in the working class township of Wentworth.  I completed matric at Fairvale Secondary in 1988, and that school at a stage was in a dilapidated condition.\n\t\tImmediately after I left school I was employed by Sasol at Secunda in the Eastern Transvaal.  I encountered serious problems with white employees as they were forever wanting to oppress me.  I observed how oppression and apartheid dominated my life.\n\t\tI got involved in the Congress of South African Students, together Gasta(?) Sharpley at the beginning of 1984.  At that time COSAS was an affiliate of the United Democratic Front. \n\t\tWe went around the Wentworth area to try and politicise the students to join the Congress of South African Students. \n\t\tDuring January/February 1985 (that should read '86) ...\"",

I was recruited by comrade Vincent James to become an active member of the African National Congress, within a unit under Commander Robert McBride.\n\t\tAt that stage we assisted in politicising the students in the area.  I received ANC material, which I read.  I often listened to Radio Freedom and participated in political discussions at the Allan Taylor residence.\n\t\tI refer to my amnesty application.  I have applied for amnesty in respect of Item 13, referred to in bundle A1, page 8, referred to as \"Grenade Attack on School Principal Leaf's House\", which occurred on the 8th of April 1986.\n\t\tI was arrested for this incident and was to have been a State witness.  However, since both Vincent James and Kevin Curtis pleaded guilty, no evidence was taken from me.  I have not been indemnified for this act, nor have I as yet been charged for it.\n\t\tA day or two before the 8th of April 1986, Vincent trained me in the use of handgrenades.  This was theoretical training.  On the day in question and ...(indistinct) 9.30pm, Vincent James, Kevin Curtis and I left the Allan Taylor residence to go to Mr Leaf's house.  I knew Mr Leaf as a member of the Labour Party and also as a police reservist.\n\t\tTwo handgrenades were used.  I carried one and Vincent James carried the other.  We approached Mr Leaf's house from the back and threw the handgrenades to the front of the house.  There were no injuries and minimal damage to his property.\n\t\tI confirm comrade Robert's submissions on this operation.  We were at that stage concerned the Labour Party supported a State of emergency and cross-border raids.  We understood Mr Leaf as a legitimate target.\"\nThank you.",

Ms Kooverjee has therefore represented Mr Allan Pearce.\n\tNow insofar as the remaining persons we represent are concerned, Janet Apelgren who Ms Kooverjee represents, is in Australia.  You heard from Ms Narkedien that she's not here.  Then we've got Derek McBride, who has handed us a statement which Ms Kooverjee intends to read.  We were hoping to do that at the end so that it facilitates the terminal end.   \n\tMr Lecordier is here, unfortunately as we all know, he's been in custody.  We've had some difficulties in finalising, I've had difficulties in finalising his statement, principally because we have difficulties in accessing him at prison.  When I got there on various occasions we met with him briefly, but the prison authorities have given us lots of problems, too numerous to mention.\n\tI'm hoping that I'd have this weekend to finalise his statement.  We have a broad statement, it's multi-paged but I would like to sit with him properly and canvass that so that we don't have any problems when I lead him.  That's really the last witness, apart from everybody else.  \n\tAnd on Antonio du Preez, Ms Kooverjee has a statement to read out, like with Derek McBride, but that would be very brief.  \n\tWith Gordon Webster, I will address you later at the end, but I'm making certain endeavours to contact him again.  He's been in touch with me, but unfortunately he's got no funds to be here.  His friends have been phoning me from time to time.  He would have liked to have been here, but I'm now out of touch with him.  I've tried to raise him, I failed to.  I don't know where he is anymore, but I'm hoping that I can raise him this weekend, I've sent messages to him.  And that's where we stand.",
