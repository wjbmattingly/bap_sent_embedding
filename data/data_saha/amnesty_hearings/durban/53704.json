What would be the relevance of even alluding to third force activity in an attempt to show us that what the applicants did, they were doing for a particular political objective?  The objective of furthering the interest of the ANC, that they had a conflict as members of the ANC and supporters of that organisation with members and supporters of another political organisation being the SACP.  I just want to find out what would be the import of alluding to third force activity because in my opinion I don't think it has any bearing nor relevance at all?",
