<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  Mr Mgidlana.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Thank you Judge.  I will lead the evidence of Mr Mafu.  May he be sworn in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">BASIL DUMISANE MAFU:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR MGIDLANA:</span> Mr Mafu could you give us your full names?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> My full names are Basil Kanye Dumisane Mafu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Where and when were you born?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> I was born in Roelofvale in the erstwhile Transkei on the 11th of September 1957.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> You are here to move an application for the granting of amnesty in respect of certain incidents.  Which political organisation did you belong to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> I belonged to and still belong to the African National Congress.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> When did you join the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> I joined the ANC around 1978 and joined its military wing in 1981, 1980.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Did you receive any military training?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> I underwent military training in Angola and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Having undergone military training, where were you deployed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> I first served in the military camp of the ANC in Angola.  Later on I served in the front, that is inside South Africa, as a Regional Commander for the Transkei.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Do you recall the year in which you served in the Transkei?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> I think I was infiltrated into the country at the beginning of 1986, or late 1985.  I can't recall the dates exactly, but I operated in the Transkei between the years 1986 and 1987, that is being physically inside the country, in the Transkei.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> When you say you operated in the Transkei, what kind of operations were you involved in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> I was involved mainly in covert operations of the nature of assault on police stations, ...(indistinct).  I think mainly those were the operations.  I'm also saying when I was physically inside the Transkei, because even if I was still outside the Transkei, having retreated to a neighbouring country, I still held the responsibility of Regional Commander for that area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> I gather that you were a Regional Commander, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> When did you become the Regional Commander?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> I was the Regional Commander from, as I'm saying, from the beginning of 1986 up until I would say 1988, if I'm not mistaken.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> As a Regional Commander, what duties did you have to shoulder?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> I had to shoulder the responsibility of advancing the struggle in the area I was deployed in.  This involved both political and conducting military operations, so I had a number of units under me, deployed in the area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> In your application for amnesty you have almost about three incidents.  Can you tell us which one happened first?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mgidlana, he's mentioned four, together with one that seems to be a blanket application, being (e).</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Let me rephrase the question.  You have mentioned about three incidents in which you were directly involved, by directly, physically involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> The fourth one being the one that took place in Mzamba.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Now in respect of those that you were directly involved, are you able to tell us which one happened first, so that we start with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> If I may remember well, I think the Borris Sedawu bombing was the first one, if I still recall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Which one did you say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> The Borris Sedawu bombing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Do you recall in which year did it take place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> I think it was 1986.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Are you able to tell us with whom were you personally involved by the way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> Together with Maziz Makadeza.  We discussed this operation with Setselo Manki, they are unfortunately both deceased now.  Setselo Manki then was working as a clerk at the Borris Sedawu building.  We therefore organised a limpet mine which we primed and handed over to Setselo Manki to go and place, if I remember well I think it was the registry section of the Borris Sedawu building, which he did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who is that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> Setselo Manki.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He was the one that was working at ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The three of you discussed this matter and in terms of the plan Manki would go place that bomb in what you say was the registry section.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> That's right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Was he a clerk in that section?</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> I beg your pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Was he a clerk in that section or where was he working?</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> I'm not sure whether he was in that section, but he was working within that department.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> That department?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Do you know which department that was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> I can't be sure whether it was the Department of Interior or whatever.  I'm not sure of the department exactly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well anyway, it doesn't really matter.  He had access to the building.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Now, are you able to tell the Committee as to why did you chose Borris Sedawu building?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> This was more of a political statement, because I remember at the time, I think it was at the time of the death of King Sebata, so there was a lot of arrogance on the part of the then Transkei Government.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So who was head of it then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> Pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who was the head of the Transkei?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> It was Matanzima, then as I'm saying ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Whose death are you talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> King ...(indistinct) Sebata.  So there was a lot of arrogance on the part of the Transkei Government pertaining to that and there was a lot of ill feeling within the communities in general, so this was in relation to that, it was a political statement on the part of the African National Congress.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Tell me more about this arrogance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> About the?</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> About the arrogance on the part of the then Transkei authority.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> King Sebata, Dalingyebo had been persecuted out of the Transkei and he went into exile.  He was exiled to Lusaka, Zambia.  I think that's where he passed away, so during his passing away, there was a lot of adverse publicity on the part of the Transkei Government.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Against?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> Against Sebata and the ANC, so we wanted to respond to that arrogance in a way which could be seen by everybody, that the ANC is opposed to what the Matanzima Government was saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sebata was a known supporter of the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> I beg your pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sebata.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> He was by then a member of the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> According to your plan, having chosen Borris Sedawu building as a target, what time did you want this bomb to go off?</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> We timed the bomb to go off before people got to work, because we didn't intend injuring any ...(indistinct), as I'm saying, this was just meant to be a political statement, so we wanted it to go off before 8 o'clock when everybody reports for work.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Are you aware as to when did it actually go off?</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> If I may recall, I'm subject to correction, I think it went off around that time, before 8 o'clock in the morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> As planned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> As planned, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Did you get to hear as to whether or not were there any people that were injured?</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> According to newspaper reports, I think there was a person who suffered some injuries.  I think it was somebody working in the Department, those who come earlier than 8 o'clock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You say someone, or some people were injured?</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> I think it was someone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> We now know that it was Mr Ndzobole, is that the person that was reported to have been injured even then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> I can't recall the name at the time, this happened a long time ago.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mgidlana, who do you say it was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Ndzobole, according to the bundle, N-D-Z-O-B-O-L-E.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mafu, are you prepared to accept that it was Mr Ndzobole who was injured?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> I've got no problem with accepting that, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Was it just one limpet mine, or were there many?</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> No, it was one limpet mine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Now with that having happened, where you say there were no other people except for this lone person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> As far as I know, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Was there any damage to the building caused?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> There must have been damage caused to the building.  I don't ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you prepared to accept that there was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> I'm prepared to accept, I mean because, when a limpet mine explodes, there's bound to be some damage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Alright.  Which was then - let's go on, which was the second incident to take place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> The Madeira Street Police Station was the second attempt of the sequence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Could you tell us as to who was involved in the planning as well as the execution of that particular operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> In the planning of the operation it was myself, Maziz Makadeza, Mbule Longono, Solly ...(indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> So you were all involved in the planning as well as the execution?</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> We were not all involved in the execution.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just hold it, I just need to write down all these names.  It seems that all your colleagues who acted with you, are now deceased.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> That's my dilemma.  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> So who was actually involved then in the execution of the operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> In the execution of the operation it was Mbule Longono, Solly Talagumeni and Siphiwe Mazwaye.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just repeat that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> Mbule Longono, Solly Talagumeni and Siphiwe Mazwaye.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Were you also involved in the execution?</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> No, I was not involved in the execution but in the planning as a Senior Commander.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Okay.  Thanks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> What was used in the execution of that particular operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> In the execution of the operation was used hand grenades, AK47's and pistols.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Who had supplied those who were to be involved in the execution with such armoury?</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> I supplied the armoury.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> What was the reason for choosing to attack Madeira Police Station?</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> Madeira Police Station was the main police station in Umtata, the capital of the Transkei.  One could safely say that it was the centre of oppression where police brutality was metered from to the people around the Transkei, so in a way it was the symbol of the Transkei Police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> According to the planning, when was this operation planned to be effected?</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> It was planned to be effected towards 10 o'clock at night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Was there any specific reason for choosing that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> The specific reason was that 10 o'clock was the curfew time in the Transkei, so we didn't want to attract attention by moving after 10 o'clock, but we thought that if it was closer to 10 o'clock, a lot of people would have left the charge office by then, that is the civilians, having applied for their curfew permits and it was also opportune because the attackers would approach the police station as if they were to come and apply for curfew permits.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When did curfew begin?</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> You mean in terms of the time of the day?  At 10 o'clock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> 10 o'clock?</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> This 10 o'clock is 10 o'clock in the evening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> So were these three going to be joined by some other people in the execution of this task, or were they just going to execute it by themselves, the three of them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> No, they were enough being three.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> As far as you are aware, were any people injured or killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> Yes, I'm aware that a number of policemen were killed and I think there were some civilians who were hit in the cross-fire.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Do you know the names of those that were killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> I'm not familiar with the names.</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> What about those that were injured, do you know them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> Also those who were injured, I'm not familiar.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Was any damage caused to the building?</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> I reckon there must have been some damage, since there were some hand grenades which exploded.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you prepared to accept that there was in fact some damage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> I'm prepared, ja.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> With that operation having been executed, are you aware of any people that were - those who went to execute that particular operation, were they arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> No, they were not arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> And you knew where they were staying, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> I knew, yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Then let's come to the third operation, then ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE POTGIETER:</span> Mr Mgidlana, what is the date of this one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> I beg your pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE POTGIETER:</span> What is the date of this attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> I can't remember the date.</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE POTGIETER:</span> Is it ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> 29 July.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE POTGIETER:</span> Is it 29th of July, is that - there's a note in our papers that it happened on the 29th of July.</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> I wouldn't dispute that date.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE POTGIETER:</span> ;   You would accept that's the date?</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> I accept it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE POTGIETER:</span> Thank you.  Yes, sorry Mr Mgidlana.</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Thank you Judge.  Then with that - what was the third operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> It was the ...(indistinct) shoot-out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Are you able to recall as to when did it take place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> I think it must have been towards the end of January in 1987.</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Was that still during the era of the Matanzimas in the Transkei as the rulers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Were you personally involved in that particular operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> Yes, I was personally involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Could you briefly tell the Committee as to what had happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> We were hiding out in a shop in the Logwaiso area, near Dwessa, so this is not an operation which was planned by us but apparently the Security Forces had got wind of where we were.  On the day in question, unfortunately two of us had gone out on another mission, so when they raided the place, they found one cadres, that is Mbule Longono, who was at the residence at the time.  We only came back the following morning, not aware that the place had been raided.  When we became aware, because we had started in another area when we got this information that the place had been raided, so we went to the place which was raided because we thought that he might still be lingering around, to try and salvage.  That was the following day after the raid.</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a>	Unfortunately we had an engagement with the Security Services before we could reach the place where he was, that is the shop in Logwaiso.  I'm not aware of any injury or death in that incident.  We were not out to assault, but we were mainly disengaging from the Security Services, because as I'm saying, it was early in the morning, at about, I think if I'm not mistaken it was between 8 and 10 in the morning, so we didn't fight with the purpose maybe to inflict injuries or casualties, but we were mainly disengaging, so that we can retreat in safety and that's what we did.  That was myself and Makadeza.  We later established communication and contact with Mbule Longono who also managed to get out of that situation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a>	I am aware that one police officer, if I'm not mistaken, might have got injured in the ensuing battle, but I'm not aware of any fatalities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> When you say in the ensuing battle, at the time that you were already there, or before you arrived?</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> I'm not sure, I suspect that it might have been when they raided the place, that is when Mbule Longono was there, but I won't dispute if it's said he got injured in the second encounter, that is with ourselves and Makadeza.</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I'm not too clear on this one.  You say your unit was hiding out at Mr Japhta's house and at some time it was necessary for two of you to leave that house for some other reason.  While you were away, you were informed that the police had raided that house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> On our way back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ja, but you weren't at the house yet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> Pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You were not at the house yet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> We were not at the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now, you then decided to go to that house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> We went to the house because one of us we had left there the previous day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> It was Mbule Longono.</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE POTGIETER:</span> Was he also called Kaya, you said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> Kaya Sizabane.</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE POTGIETER:</span> Was that his combat name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> I beg your pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE POTGIETER:</span> Was that his combat name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> That's his combat name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, now you left Longono there and then you wanted to go see what - why did you go there now?  You say you left him there the previous day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> We left him there the previous day and the house was raided when we were not there, so when we came back, we got information that there had been a raid and it was our moral and military responsibility to go and establish exactly what happened and rescue him out of that situation because our concern was that he was alone and we were two who had left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> On your way there, you encountered the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And there was a firearm engagement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> That's right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ja.</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> As I'm saying, I'm not aware of any fatalities in that ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> There was shooting across.</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> There was shooting across, they also brought in a helicopter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now, do you know how your colleague Longono got injured?</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> I beg your pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How did he get injured?</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> No, he was not injured in that situation.  He got out of that situation, as we later joined with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So his injury had nothing to do with this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> No, no, no, it was somewhere - he didn't die in that situation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, but did he get injured?</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did he get injured in a separate matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> The injury I was talking about, I was saying I think there might have been a policeman who got injured in that situation, not Mbule.</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> When you met with these Security Forces, how far were you from the or to the Japhta shop?</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> Well as we were approaching the Japhta shop, there is a hill.  As we were coming over the hill, that's when we saw the police officers and they were travelling in a Golf, then they pursued us from there, so we were almost next to the - I think we were less than a kilometre from the Japhta shop.</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> When you say you later met up with Longono, where were you?  Were you still at Logwaiso or somewhere else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> No, no, we were not in Logwaiso.  After the shoot-out we manoeuvred to Butterworth and he had taken the route to Umtata, so we established communication and joined up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Alright.  Then did you assist Longono then to escape out of the Transkei, or did he remain inside the Transkei area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> No, we left Transkei after some two weeks or so into Lesotho.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was he in police custody when you returned, or planning to return to that safehouse?</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> To the?</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Safehouse.</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> No, he was not arrested.  He managed to escape.</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, that's what I'm trying to get at.  During the raid, was he found at that house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> Yes, he was in the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So he was arrested there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> He was not arrested, he out-manoeuvred the police.  They had surrounded the homestead, but he managed to get out of the homestead.</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So your engagement with the police, had nothing to do with his freedom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> We didn't know by then that he had managed to get out of the house, because this had happened overnight and we were returning in the morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I know that, but now that you know what the facts are, I'm just confirming with you that his freedom was not the result of your engagement with the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Then in your application you also mention the Mzamba incident.  How were you involved in respect of that incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> I was involved in the Mzamba incident in terms of supplying weaponry to Mayapi and Zamela, who were in my unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Did you help with the planning at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> Pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Did you help with the planning of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> Well I would say it was preliminary planning in the sense of just identifying the target, not specifically where the limpet mine would be placed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And did you give approval for that operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> I did give approval for the operation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And what was the object?</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> The object was the Wild Coast Casino.</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Yes, I know.  What was the objective of the attack there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> The objective of the attack was to make a political statement in the area and in terms of taking the war to everybody.</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> When you say everybody, what do you mean?</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> Everybody, even those fraternised the casinos.</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You say you supplied the firearms, or the ammunition.</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> I supplied the limpet mines as well as the firearms, but there were no firearms used, it was only placing of the limpet mine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> So in respect of all these incidents, except for the Logwaiso one where you did not supply the weaponry, did you supply any weapons to Longono?</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> Yes, I did supply weapons to him because he was falling under my unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> So in respect of all these incidents, you had supplied weaponry when you - were these licensed firearms and explosives, did you have any authority to possess this weaponry?</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> No, they were not licensed firearms.  They were weapons of Eastern origin.  These weapons we brought into the country for purposes of pursuing the armed struggle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just get this thing straight there with me, I'm not too clear on it.  You say this Mzamba holiday resort was in actual fact a resort which included a Casino.</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was it targeted, the resort targeted because it had a casino?</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> Not necessarily the Casino, because it had a Casino.  As I'm saying the purpose then was to take war to everybody, there was an escalation of armed struggle.  If I remember well then the clarion call by the ANC then was to take war even to the white suburbs, if I remember, so this was in that light.</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But wasn't the call and I'm not sure of my dates now, 8th of January 87 I think, was in fact that call, but wasn't it a qualified call to take it to State institutions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> I may not be sure of the exact dates and maybe in terms of the briefings that filtered to ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, let us not talk about the dates then, but that particular call to take it even to the white suburbs, was that not a qualified call to take it to the white suburbs, but to attack State institutions, like police stations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> Well at the time, and may be Casino was all, the one ...(indistinct) was also owned mainly by the Transkei Government, that might have qualified as a State institution.  I'm not referring to the people inside because care had been taken in that operation not to place it maybe in the machines where the people ...(indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You say care was taken to minimise any casualties.</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> I don't understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You said care was taken to minimise any casualties.</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you planned this and approved of this attack, was that the reasoning that the Casino should be targeted because it was owned by the then Transkei government and therefore qualified as a State institution?</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> Yes.  Yes, Judge, because in our understanding it was that it was generated income for the Transkei Government and therefore supported that regime.</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can I just be absolutely clear, this Casino you're talking about is what's known as the Wild Coast Sun.</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> That's right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> In your application you also make some kind of a general application in the sense that you claim responsibility ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Before you go to there Mr Mgidlana, is he entitled to make such an application?</p>

<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well isn't that a legal matter that you must advise your client on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> In fact I just wanted him to comment on it, be very difficult for him to say what specific incidents.</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well I will accept that you cleared it with him and he was unable to do so and that's the end of the matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> As it pleases.</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But I'm not going to stop you, if you really want him to give that answer, then proceed, but it's not going to make much difference.</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> Yes, thank you Chair.  Are there any other incidents that probably you now recall?</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well it's a bit too late, the date has gone by.</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Well, they may have been covered under that general application.  He will then be recalling them now Judge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You would be in the same position whether he recalls it now or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> There's another issue that has been brought up regarding an incident that took place in the Maclear ...area regarding policemen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did he make application for that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> He hasn't Judge, but it's just that it came up from the TRC evidence analyst, so I just want him to comment on it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But in his application, he doesn't make mention of it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> He doesn't make mention, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is the purpose of you raising that incident?  For him to apply for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> No, Judge, I just wanted him to clear us out, whether he was involved or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Thank you Judge.  Involving policemen that were shot.  You may have heard about it from the evidence analyst from the TRC, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> Yes, I heard about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Were you in any manner involved?</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> I was not involved, but I know of the incident since it was involving members of the unit under me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> I didn't hear your answer, members of?</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> Of my unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Of your unit, sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> So you were not involved in the planning and even the execution thereof?</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> It was not a planned operation, I think it was just a meeting engagement between two members of the unit and the police patrol van.</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> So you are not seeking any amnesty in respect of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> That is the evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now Mr Mgidlana, can you give us an indication in respect of each incident, what he actually applied for?  Let us take the incident, the Borris Sedawu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> In respect of the Borris Sedawu incident Judge, he's seeking amnesty in respect of the possession and supplying of unlicensed firearms, unlawful and unlicensed explosives and explosive devices in this form of the limpet mine, as well as malicious damage to property.  It could be viewed as attempted murder or assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm in respect of the person that was injured, as well as what could be generally called conspiracy to commit an offence, which if he were to be charged, it could be said to be unknown to the State in respect of his involvement in the planning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Does he remember precisely what kind of limpet mine it was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> No, I can't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Was it a standard used ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> Standard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...subject to what you've got to say, is it not, is this matter not a question of an application for amnesty in respect of sabotage in the attacking that building?  What you've mentioned is all competent verdicts that arise out of that incident and if we were to grant him amnesty, it would be in fact for sabotage of that building.</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> I agree with that Judge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, okay.  Let's get onto the second.</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> In respect of the second incident which is Madeira police station.</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ja.</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Again it will be sabotage in respect of that incident.  Murder, because we now know that there were people who were killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How many people died there?  Seven?</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Excuse me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How many people died?</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> It seems there are about eight Judge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Eight?</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> About eight yes, even though I don't know whether they died there and then, or subsequent to that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Five people were injured?</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Yes, it could be in respect of them attempted murder as well as alternative loss of ...(indistinct)  Excuse me Judge?</p>

<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Malicious injury to property as well. Possession and supplying of explosives and firearms and ammunition.</p>

<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> In the Logwaiso incident it will be possession of unlicensed firearms as well as ammunition, which they used to ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(indistinct - mike not on)</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Yes, that was our incident as well as, if anyone was injured, attempted murder or assault, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(indistinct - mike not on)</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Yes, that could be attempted ...  We are not so sure as to whether any police vehicles were damaged, but in the event that they were, Judge, we will be also seeking amnesty in respect of malicious injury to property.</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(indistinct - mike not on)</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Yes. In respect of that one, it is the supply ... yes, yes, as well as the possession of the explosives and firearms and ammunition that he supplied those operatives with.  Again understanding that there was murder and some people who were injured in that incident, in the event that it could be said that he could have been charged under the common purpose doctrine, we would apply for amnesty in respect of that murder as well as alternatively attempted murder and assault.  Mali-cious damage to property as well in respect of that one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Anything else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Over and above, there's these offences I mentioned of conspiracy to commit an offence unknown to the State.  That will be all.  I may as well indicate that I'm also certain, I'm just subject to being given guidance by the Committee, insofar as his failure to report to the police that the people who committed these various offences are so and so and so when he knew them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I know that that is a technical point that the academics normally raise, but I can think, for the life of me, that a person who commits a crime has any intention of walking into a police station and saying:  "Look, I committed this."  The fact that he committed a crime means he doesn't want anybody to find out, so he would want to go there.  I don't know even if there's a duty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">MIKE TURNED OFF:</span> ...to explore.  Is there anything else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> I think then on that note Judge, that is all.  Again of course unless there are others that the Panel ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MGIDLANA</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Nontenja.</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">MR NONTENJA:</span> At this point, Judge, I'd ask for a short adjournment so that I can take proper and further instructions from my client in respect of the application made by the applicant and the revelations which were not to our knowledge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How long will you need?</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">MR NONTENJA:</span> I don't think it's going to be too long Judge, it could be less than 10 minutes.</p>

<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>

<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">MR NONTENJA:</span> Thank you Judge.  Judge, we have just a few questions to the applicant according to my instructions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR NONTENJA:</span> Mr Mafu, in respect of the Borris Sedawu incident, you're saying the timing of the bomb was intended to explode before 8 o'clock, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> Correct, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">MR NONTENJA:</span> Why was it so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> It was timed to explode before 8 o'clock, because after 8 o'clock there are people who are working in Borris Sedawu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MR NONTENJA:</span> Okay.  If I understand you well, it was your intention not to injure ordinary citizens in your operation, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> Correct, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">MR NONTENJA:</span> Now in respect of the Madeira incident, your timing was 10 p.m., is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> Correct, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">MR NONTENJA:</span> And I take it that you are aware that at 10 o'clock, 10 p.m., people were in great numbers, rushing for the curfew permits at the charge office, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> Our experience was that towards 10 o'clock, at about quarter to, police start chasing people away to say it's almost curfew time, go now.  So we were under the impression that by 10 o'clock, at least it's already cleared with people who had come to request permits.</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">MR NONTENJA:</span> I take it that you are aware that at the time of the arrival of the members, of your members, members of your unit, they could clearly see before commencing their attack, that there was quite a number of people inside the charge office before attacking.</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> I may not be sure of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">MR NONTENJA:</span> But now, according to the statistics and in terms of the bundle of papers, the number of victims consists of ordinary citizens, instead of police officers, is that not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> I'm not sure about the statistics.</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">MR NONTENJA:</span> You didn't peruse the bundle of papers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> I beg your pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MR NONTENJA:</span> Did you peruse the bundle of papers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">MR NONTENJA:</span> First page, to the second page.  Let me rephrase my question.  The number of people who died is more the police officers who were at work at that point in time.  Are you aware of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> I'm not aware Sir.  I see some are referred to in their police denominations, others are not.  I'm not sure who's a civilian, who's not a civilian, in the list as it stands.</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">MR NONTENJA:</span> Now are you aware that one of the victims was attacked far away from the Madeira Police Station during your operation at that point in time?  At Sprigg Street, to be precise.</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, will you repeat that name for us please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">MR NONTENJA:</span> The victim?</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> The name of the street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">MR NONTENJA:</span> Sprigg Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Spruit Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">MR NONTENJA:</span> S-P-R-I-G-G.</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sprigg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">MR NONTENJA:</span> Yes and her name was Mama.  Are you aware of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> I'm not aware Sir, but I wouldn't say that would be impossible.  I don't know what must have happened.  There might have been some hiccup or misunderstanding in the heat of the moment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What does that mean?</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> As I'm saying Judge, I'm not sure of what happened.  There might have been some obstruction which might have been misinterpreted by people in that emotional situation, I mean from members from my unit.  As I'm saying, I'm not sure exactly of what happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And Mr Nontenja, you're saying that the person you refer to as the deceased, was killed as a result of the attack for which Mr Mafu makes application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">MR NONTENJA:</span> Exactly, exactly, Judge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Have you got more details as to how that happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">MR NONTENJA:</span> Those at the instructions from my client.</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, but surely when you consulted, you must have got details?</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">MR NONTENJA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So let's hear those details, put it to the witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">MR NONTENJA:</span> Thank you.  Immediately after the attack at the Madeira police station, a street on the other street, which is named Sprigg street, ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you know where is Sprigg Street in Umtata?</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> ...(indistinct - mike not on)</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you know where is Sprigg Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> Yes, I know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can the witness get one of these things?</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> English is on Channel 2.</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you know where Sprigg Street is in Umtata?</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> Yes, I know Judge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It's apparently off Madeira Street, or near Madeira Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> It's a street parallel to Madeira Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now it's been put to you that something occurred in Sprigg Street immediately after the attack on the police station at Madeira, am I correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a><span class="speaker">MR NONTENJA:</span> That is correct, thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now can you tell the witness what exactly you're referring to, what happened and where?</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">MR NONTENJA:</span> In fact are you aware of that incident which occurred immediately after ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He said it might have happened, it doesn't know.  Have you got details for him to try to remember or to deal with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a><span class="speaker">MR NONTENJA:</span> My Lord, I just - I wanted to ask him, in fact, as he indicated right from the beginning that he was not personally  involved in that operation, I just wanted to find out from him whether he was aware of this incident which occurred at Sprigg Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you aware of an incident that occurred in Sprigg Street immediately after?</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> No, I was not aware of anything that happened in Sprigg Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You see, I appreciate what your position is because it's not been put to you in any detail.  We talk about the incident.  We must now assume it was a violent incident related to your unit's activities, that's why I asked Mr Nontenja, you know, give us some details so that we could connect it.  It may be some other incident, like a knife stabbing or something that had nothing to do with your unit.  We don't know and that's why I think it's better to clearly put it to the witness, maybe he can say:  "Look, I know" or "I don't know".</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a><span class="speaker">MR NONTENJA:</span> Thank you Judge.  Mr Mafu, it is alleged that immediately after the commission of the operation at Madeira Street the members of your unit attacked person in Sprigg Street.  Are you aware of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> I'm not aware of that incident, Mr Nontenja.  What I know is that during the commission of the operation there was another member of the unit who was deployed outside the police station, because there were some policemen coming in, so I know there was shooting and outside the police station.  I'm not aware of Madeira Street.</p>

<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> Of Sprigg Street, I'm sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a><span class="speaker">MR NONTENJA:</span> My Lord, I don't have any further questions.</p>

<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS THABETHE:</span> Mr Mafu, I also don't have any questions with regard to the incidents you've applied for, except just to clarify the issue of dates and maybe one other aspect.  On page 27 of the bundle there's a newspaper article, do you have sight of it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Okay.  In the third column towards the end, there's a line which says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a>"Following a bomb attack at Mzamba One Stage hotel on April 18 1986..."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a>then it goes on.   Would you concede that this is the date?  Do you have any problem with that, that this is the date on which this incident happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> As I'm saying Ma'am, I might not be sure of the sequence of events.  I'm not sure.  I can't dispute that that was the date.</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Okay.  Also on page 27 of the bundle, the second column now, further up, there's a paragraph starting with</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a>"After details of shoot-out ..."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a>Do you have sight of that paragraph?</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> It makes mention of Zolile Nklati as the Commander of the ANC's military machinery in Transkei.  Do you have any knowledge of this person?  Was this person the military Commander?</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> Well as you are aware Ma'am, this was not written by me, it must have come from somewhere else.  I know that we went under very different names.  At some stage, Makadeza was Zolile, he had gone under different names.  I don't know who Zolile Nklati is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Thank you Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS THABETHE</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a><span class="speaker">RE-EXAMINATION BY MR MGIDLANA:</span> Thank you Judge.  Just a follow up Mr Mafu on this Zolile Nklati.  You'll see that it appears there that there were four people involved in this incident, as mentioned in that report.  How many people were involved in that particular operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> In the operation we were three.  As I've mentioned, it was Kaya, Maziz, Makadeza and myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Sorry you were saying that people were going under different names.  Did I get you as mentioning Makadeza as one of the persons commonly known as Zolile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> Yes, I'm saying that at one stage he went under the name Zolile.</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> So shall we take it therefore that that could be a repetition, one and the same person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> Maybe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> But otherwise you are certain that there was no other person by that name involved in that particular incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MGIDLANA</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Mr Mafu, you'll accept if one looks again at page 27 in the first column towards the bottom there's an underlined portion which refers to the shoot-out as having occurred on the 21st and 22nd.  From that we will infer that your involvement was on the 22nd.</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAFU:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> It just helps us peg the date clearly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mgidlana, have you got any argument.  Before that, have you got any other witnesses?</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> No, there's no other witnesses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Nontenja, have you got any witnesses?</p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a><span class="speaker">MR NONTENJA:</span> No witness to call.</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> No witnesses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Have you got any submissions to make?</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Yes, very few Judge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA IN ARGUMENT:</span> My submission is that from the evidence of the applicant, it is clear that he committed these particular offences as a member of an identifiable political organisation, namely the African National Congress as well as being a member of the Military Wing of the ANC, namely Umkhonto weSizwe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a>	Furthermore it is clear that the targets were targets that were associated with the political order in existence in the area called Transkei.  They were indeed Government installations, even in respect of Mzamba, we have heard that the Transkei Government was owning the portion of whatever share holding was there and as such deriving some funds for the operation of that Government.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a>	There is no evidence suggesting that the applicant committed these offences in furtherance of his own ambition, personal ambition.  He was involved in all these incidents in furtherance of the struggle, he being on the side of the liberation movement, fighting against an oppressive government that we all know was in existence in that area and as such he did not derive any benefit.  There hasn't been any suggestion made to the effect that he has not made any full disclosure and as such my submission is that his evidence has just been so clear and is in compliance with the promotion of Reconciliation Act and as such he has made full disclosure and it is my submission that he qualifies to be granted amnesty and I therefore apply that such amnesty be granted in the favour of the applicant.   That is all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a><span class="speaker">MR NONTENJA:</span> Thank you.  Thank you Judge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a><span class="speaker">MR NONTENJA IN ARGUMENT:</span> According to the instructions of my clients, although they are not opposed to the granting of the application, but they do not have the final detail to that effect, it is therefore in the hands of this Honourable Committee to make a finding accordingly.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> I have no objections to amnesty being granted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a>NO ARGUMENT BY MS THABETHE</p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you.  We will reserve our decision in this matter and it will be delivered in due course.</p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a><span class="speaker">MR MGIDLANA:</span> Thank you Judge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ms Thabethe, what is the position at the moment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Mr Chair, the position is that I had set down three matters for today.  The Mafu matter, Mahambane matter and the Pilay matter.  I haven't seen Mr Pilay yet.  Mr Mahambane is here.  I had requested the legal representatives to be here at 2, the representatives in the matter of Mahambane, but I did telephone them and requested them to come earlier.  The lawyer for the victims is present, I've seen her.  Ms Loonat is on her way.  She said she'd be here by half past 12, so I would request an indulgence of maybe five to ten minutes and I'll let the Committee know as soon as they are here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, so be it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Thank you.</p>
