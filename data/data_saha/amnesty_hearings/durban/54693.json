            "As I have explained in previous incidents, I got instructions from Chief Mathaba who was a member of the IFP Central Committee, and at that time was a member of the Kwazulu Legislator.  He gave me an instruction that there was an nduna amongst many of his ndunas whom he required that I and my group kill urgently.  He informed me that this nduna is very problematic to the IFP.  Because firstly he is mobilising a campaign against the carrying of traditional weapons.\n\tI think the Commission knows that traditional weapons were associated with the IFP, because the IFP is mainly built on Zulu cultures.  Therefore a person who was against people who are members of the public, particularly Zulus, for them to practice their culture, carrying of traditional weapons, that person was assumed to be against the Zulu culture and also against the IFP as an organisation that was mainly practising this culture.\n\tHe said this nduna was so problematic that he was mobilising people not to attend meetings that were organised by him.  Such meetings that he would call as the Inkozi of the area or meetings that he would call as a central committee member of the IFP.  This nduna was encouraging people not to attend these meetings organised by Chief Mathaba.\n\tHe also mentioned that this nduna is a certain leader within the ANC, but not in his own area.  I was confused as to if he resides in the chief's area and is not a leader in that area, who is leader?  In which area is he a leader from?  But I couldn't ask such questions at that time because you have to respect Inkozi and not ask too many questions.  This is in line with the way that we are brought up.  So I did not ask that kind of questions.  But he pointed out that this nduna should be killed immediately.",

            "We then went to Chief Mathaba.  We knocked on the door.  He opened it and as planned at Mrs Mbuyazi, he let us in.  The Chief then asked one of his ndunas who was also his praise singer, Manxele - his surname is Manxele, I don't know his first name.  Because we didn't know where this nduna that we were supposed to kill, resided.\n\tWe then left the VW Golf that we had been travelling in and got into another car, Chief Mathaba's car, the Toyota Cressida.  We got into the car.  We were armed and Manxele showed us a place, a sugarcane field where we parked the car.  We went through the sugarcane field on foot with Manxele.\n\tHe then pointed out the house to us where this nduna stayed.  His name was Mzimela.  We asked about the situation in the nduna's house and he showed us the room or the hut where he slept.  Manxele had information that the nduna slept alone in his hut and indeed, we found him alone.  The house that the nduna slept in was a two-roomed hut.  And there were other huts around it.\n\tWe knocked on the door and the nduna responded from inside and inquired as to who we were.  We told him that we are police and we want to search the hut.  He refused to open the door for us because the situation wasn't safe and we asked him why is it not safe, and he told us that there is a rumour, a bad rumour around the place and he wouldn't open the door; we should come back the following morning.\n\tWe begged the nduna - myself doing that - assuring him that I was a policeman; we just wanted to search the hut because we had information that he had weapons in the hut.  He then looked through the window.  He wanted us to show our appointment certificates that we are indeed policemen.  I had agreed to do this.\n\tHe opened the curtain to really ascertain that we were indeed policemen.  As he was doing this, Zwele's brother fired a shot.  The shots missed the nduna but it hit on the edge of the window.  When Zwele hit the edge of the window, he hit a wooden edge of the window which caught fire and the curtain also caught fire.\n\tWe realized that the people in the other huts would identify us and were then forced to kick the door open; and we did this.\n\tThere could be something that I'm forgetting.  We had been informed that the nduna had guns in his hut, and we did believe that he had them, although we didn't see the guns.  Because when he was refusing to open the door, we heard a noise inside and we thought that he was readying his guns.  And when he wanted to see our certificates, there was a noise like a gun being loaded.  But when we got inside the hut we didn't have time to check if there were really guns inside the hut.\n\tBecause when we kicked the door open Zwele's brother stepped inside first.  He was carrying a shotgun, carrying it at the ready.  As he entered the nduna grabbed the shotgun and they struggled, and we couldn't get any closer because it had become dark.  The fire had turned out.\n\tWe didn't know how to get any closer because they were fighting, both grabbing the gun and we didn't know if one of them was going to squeeze the trigger at any time.  So we didn't know what to do.\n\tAs they were fighting, Israil Fangwane went down on all fours, crawling towards them.  And he went behind the chief and shot him in the head at close range.  The nduna fell down and then Zwele Dlamini's brother and Israil fired several shots at him.\n\tAfter that we didn't look for the guns which were supposedly in a trunk.  We just fled.\n\tIn that pandemonium a shot was fired and Israil thought that he had been hit on the knee.  It appeared later that he wasn't really hit, but his jean was.  When we left the scene we were carrying him to go to the car because we thought he had been hit.\n\tWhen we got into the car, we sped off.  When we arrived at Chief Mathaba's house and there was light, we realized that he was not hit.\n\tWe then told the Inkozi that we had done our job well and we got into Jerry's car and we left quickly because we were afraid that the police might be called at any time.",

            "I was patrolling the area as a policeman.  I was near J2 and I heard gunshots from H2.  I was with W/O  Mhlango in the car.  Using a ZP886.  When we heard gunshots from the H2 section we proceeded there.  As we were approaching the main road near Esikhawini Training College we came towards the Gondana bus stop.  As we approached there we saw two vans parked there, and there was a crowd of people.\n\tThere were people who were apparently arrested and we enquired about what was going on.  The unit that was patrolling around that area was headed by Sgt Bethuebjele.  And he explained to us that they had caught this group of people who had weapons, guns.\n\tWe enquired as to who these people were and nobody seemed to know.  And these people also didn't want to say who they were.\n\tAs we heard gunshots it appeared that these people had been trying to run away from the police, but the police pursued them and caught them.  Although I don't remember quite well how many they were; there could have been three or four.\n\tI grabbed one of them and asked him who they were and where they were from; they should talk quickly so that there was a tense political situation in the area.  If they don't talk, they might be in trouble.  I managed to convince this person and eventually he told me that as they were there, they were not residents but they were from Johannesburg.  And that they had come to Mrs Mbuyazi's house from Johannesburg.  And their purpose for being there - I enquired why they were carrying guns and he told me that they were with some other boy.\n\tI asked if they had been going to attack some place and he denied that.  I then called W/O Mhlambo to the site as well as Sgt Vyela.  And we discussed that if they were coming from Mrs Mbuyazi's house, they must be IFP members.  So we couldn't arrest them.\n\tMhlambo and Vyela agreed with me, although they were not very active IFP members.  We agreed that because there were a lot of police in the area, we couldn't trust the police who were there.  We agreed with these two men, Vyela and Mhlambo that we will take the guns and the people and pretend that we are going to the police station to arrest them or to charge them.  And Sgt Vyela will take the other group of policemen and continue patrolling H2 section.\n\tThis we did.  We proceeded to J1.  We passed Mrs Mbuyazi's house and we dropped them off at a bottle store somewhere near there and we took the guns and we went back to Mrs Mbuyazi's house and we enquired about this matter.  And she was very shocked.  We asked her if she knew these people and she said yes.\n\tAnd she told us that these people had been brought by Themba Khoza from Johannesburg.  So I asked her why she didn't inform me about this matter.  Because these people will just carry out operations and they may be attacked by us or they may indeed attack us by mistake.\n\tSo she apologized for this and enquired where they were at the moment.  So we told her that we had released them, although we had kept their guns with us.  I fetched the guns from the car and I gave them to her.  I told her that those people were on their way.\n\tI think I'm confusing this a bit.  I think the guns were given to Sgt Vyela who was supposed to bring them later.  I'm not really sure.  But what I do know is that eventually the guns were given to Mrs Mbuyazi.  I'm not sure whether I brought them or Sgt Vyela brought them.\n\tBut we discussed this matter with Mrs Mbuyazi at that time, and she confirmed that Themba Khoza had brought these people.  Because when there was an IFP rally at Esikhawini and the ANC attacked this rally, one person died.  And this person who had died was not from Natal, but from Johannesburg and he was one of the people who had been from Johannesburg.\n\tSo these people from Johannesburg were very angry and wanted to retaliate to the ANC for killing one of their members.  That was their mission.  But we and my group didn't know about it until I spoke Mrs Mbuyazi about it.\n\tThe reason I have mentioned this is because it was a crime.  It was illegal for us to release these people because we were defeating the ends of justice.  Because it could be that the police that we found at the scene could have arrested those people.  And the guns should have been returned to the Government, but this didn't happen.  Nobody was prosecuted and I don't remember reporting this crime to anyone.",

And I also got hold of several bullets.\n\tAnd some of the weapons, like hand grenades, I also still remember that there was something at Esikhawini at the time because there was Mr Khumalo who was in assistance of Inkatha.  He too sent me to fetch some of the hand grenades at the camp.  And some arms came with Joyful Mthethwa.  I am not quite sure where he got these arms, but I must also state that I indicated yesterday that at the time when we were forming this hit squad Joyful Mthethwa was one of the people to whom I was referred for assistance.  So that arms and guns such as Scorpions came with him from Nseleni.\n\tThere is one particular gun, an AK rifle that was collected by Romeo from Mrs Mbuyazi, and it too became part of the arms cache that we had.\n\tWe also raided homes, some of which we already knew that they had guns.  We would not arrest those people during the raids; we would simply take the guns so that they could be used by the syndicate.\n\tWe really confiscated several guns, including shotguns.  And the guns that we received later on were the ones that were taken by Romeo and Constable Mthethwa.   And these guns came from J1; two pistols and one AK.

            "Mr Chairperson, shortly this might be one of the most serious sacrifices, but I am just happy that it gave me an opportunity to clear my conscience.  But I am very hurt because I see myself as a fool who failed to do proper calculations timeously.  I could have used my energy to do something else.  Maybe I would be having lots of money today; maybe I'll be someone prominent within the community, but not the criminal as I am being referred to by the IFP today.  I struggled because of the IFP beliefs.  And I recruited other people into the same struggle; people like Romeo.  People whom I recruited from the police force where they were honestly working.\n\tI struggled so that people could be freed from the white man's oppression.  This was a wrong way of struggling because the people with whom I was struggling, following their instructions in particular, are not anywhere near me today.  And they never were since I landed in trouble and these very same poor souls that I recruited into the problem.  And they never kept their promises.\n\tEverybody who was engaged in the struggle in this country, are proud of having engaged in their struggle.  For example, look at the PAC and the ANC.  They are proud about the fact that they were engaged in the struggle that liberated their country.  In my case many people died and I cannot take pride in that kind of a struggle.  And I am very shameful and I am also shameful thinking about my children.  I am shameful about that.\n\tAnd I was deserted, and they denied knowing me.   And I smelled as I am smelling now.  It upset me to hear from the media what insults came from IFP leaders referring to us as having conducted our own criminal activities.  I swear here before the Commission that there is no personal benefit that was... [end of side 1]...have.  If I wanted a State car, I could get it any time.  Things like those.\n\tAnd my personal things.  For example, one day I wanted R2 300 to go and pay for my house at Dundee.  A house that I had just bought.  They easily gave me the money and I did not pay it back.  And it was not even indicated that I should pay it back.  Things like that.\n\tYes, I received certain help.  If I wanted to move furniture or things from one place to another they could easily provide State trucks to my disposal.  Those are the kind of things that I can claim as having gained.  And those are the sorts of things that motivated me to continue with the kind of struggle in which I was engaged.\n\tBut there is nothing that I can indicate as having profited from.  It is therefore very sad that a person can be engaged in this sort of a struggle.  The IFP leaders are denying knowledge of us.  They don't know us.\n\tI find it very strange that I went to Caprivi.  How did I know about Caprivi?  Where did I get finance to go to Caprivi for training?\n\tThey are also refusing or denying the training that was going on at Caprivi.  Point to me any chief around here whose bodyguards are using rocket launches.  I know not of any.  But we were using all these sorts of things; explosives, cortex, fuses and all sorts of things; beehives.  And we were trained so that we could guard the chiefs and heads.  Explosives were used in the training so that we could guard these people.\n\tI swear that during my training we used all sorts of weapons except for any legal South African made rifle.  We were using Eastern Block weapons.  God knows all about that.  Maybe one day the truth will surface.\n\tWhat I can say here, I have committed and dedicated myself, be it any probe or form.  I am dedicated to say exactly what I am saying here.  I know what I am saying, that this places me in danger.  Because I am still going to talk.  This is as good as sacrificing my life after having killed so many people.\n\tI know that I am still going to talk, even if there is any investigation that will come later, regardless of who is going to be affected or arrested.  I want the truth to out that I am not a criminal.  I am prepared to testify.\n\tI am not therefore saying that I would like to see justice being done.  I would actually like to see justice being done in the country to cleanse my name, and these gentlemen with whom I am arrested and everybody who is in the same predicament as myself.  So that finally the community should know that we were not criminals.  This is how we worked.\n\tThis is what I wish to say.",

            "Yes.  I can explain that.  After being sentenced and sent to Westville Prison there came the Colonel who was in charge of the prison, together with his Lieutenant.  He called me and Romeo Mbambo and Israil Fangwane saying there is a Minister who wanted to see us.  We were taken therefore from our cells and we went to Level 1.  We went down from Level 5 to Level 1 and we were driven in a van from Medium B going to the Commanding Officer's office, Mr De Beer.\n\tAnd on arrival there, there was Dr Sipho Mzimela, the Minister of Correctional Services who was with his wife and his bodyguards.  De Beer himself was present.  We exchanged greetings and we took our seats.\n\tI still remember that at that time with my co-accused we had made an application that we wanted to be sent to the Maritzburg Prison.  The first thing that we discussed with Dr Mzimela was why do we want to go to Maritzburg.  And we explained to him further.  And he ended up advising that it was not safe to go to Maritzburg because in the first place that jail is dominated by Popcru which is regarded as the police union which is shaking hands or rubbing shoulders with the ANC.  De Beer himself also indicated that Westville was fine for us, because they would make sure that we are protected.  It would not be the same as Maritzburg, because Maritzburg is a Popcru dominated area.\n\tSecondly we discussed the issue of visits.  The grading, such as D group and depending on one's behaviour, the grading would proceed that way.  But if a person is under a group, such a person would get better privileges.  And all of those things are things that we discussed.  And we promised that we would behave so that we can get better grades to get visits and better privileges.  Because a person would under normal circumstances not be allowed to have more than five visitors per month.\n\tAnd we finally agreed that we would not be transferred to Maritzburg; we would wait until Romeo came back from Nelspruit.  Because Romeo was supposed to go to Nelspruit; he was supposed to have left the previous day, but he did not go.  He was supposed to attend a certain trial at Nelspruit.  And it was indicated that a final decision as to the transfer to Maritzburg would be made as soon as Romeo came back and we agreed on this.\n\tDr Sipho Mzimela who is Minister of the Correctional Services, and he was an IFP minister at the time and also holding a high position as a Deputy General Secretary for Inkatha nationally, and he requested that the white officers excuse us so that we could discuss as a family and the four of us remained; Israil, Fangwane, Mzimela and so on.\n\tThe first thing that we discussed was finding a way of getting out of prison.  We wanted to know what the position was regarding that.  And secondly we discussed the TRC.\n\tWith reference to the TRC Dr Mzimela indicated where the IFP stood, and he did not mince his words.  He indicated that they were first of all not involved in the formation of the TRC and therefore they were not towing that line.  And he indicated that the TRC is nothing but the political ploy of the ANC to get their enemy.  And also that they knew that - that was '95 at the time; the TRC has not started yet, but it was known that the TRC was underway.  But it hadn't started working at the time.  And Dr Mzimela indicated that the TRC is just but an ANC wing which was to be used to undermine the integrity of all organisations they were opposed to; organisations like the IFP and therefore they were not in favour of the TRC idea.\n\tAnd it transpired that this would place us in a difficult position.  We started wondering as to whether we should submit our application to the TRC or not.  And Dr Mzimela started asking as to whether our names were included in the list of the IFP.  And he started to make a call.  We don't know who he was calling at the office, but he seemed to be speaking to his secretary.  And he wanted to establish through the computer as to whether our names were included in the list of the IFP for those people who were implicated in political activities.\n\tAnd apparently it transpired that our names were not included in the list, and therefore our names had to be included in the list.  Things such as our names, prison numbers, dates of sentences and so forth; charges for which we were sentenced.  And we gave him all this information and he gave this information in turn to the person with whom he was speaking on the phone.  And he instructed that files be made ready.   He was going to check them as soon as he got to his office.\n\tAnd he promised us that they were going to do something about our release.  And that was the last we saw of him.

And although other things were done covertly, the community know about them but they just couldn't talk about them at the time because of the situation.\n\tI indicated or spoke yesterday and tried to convey how committed I am to reconciliation with the members or next of kin of the people that I killed, and also with the community that I traumatised.\n\tI would like to say this before I go any further: that it should be well known that what is being alleged now, that I have joined the ANC is not true.  They should rather say that now I can see clearly.  They shouldn't say that I have joined the ANC.  Or maybe that what I am saying today is because I have joined the ANC or want to join the ANC.\n\tI and the other people that are here today, we know it very well that we have killed ANC members and we know how painful that is to the ANC.  We know that there are people who were hurt by what we did to their family members.  Therefore we think that what we are doing here, will enable them to forgive us at some point.\n\tOur main objective is to let them know what happened to their family members and for them to forgive us, and for us to reconcile.\n\tFinally I would like to say that mistakes such as these should not happen again in the future.  Our present government should not find itself in the same situation.  And the youth should also not fall into the same trap of being manipulated like myself and be used and exploited by people in positions of authority in the community.  This will help the youth not to fall into such a trap.  It will also help people to forgive us.\n\tI realize that if I say that I am sorry, or if I say that forgive me, it would be insufficient.  I am as good as having said nothing because that will not bring these people back.  I mentioned yesterday that there are orphans who grow without their fathers, because we are responsible for those people's death.  This is something we'll carry with us to the grave.\n\tI mentioned yesterday that my apology will not help the families of people like the Mkwana as a family.  It will not help them financially; it will not help them in their socio-economic situation.  We are very hurt and deeply sorry about this.\n\tWe are very committed to seeing justice done.  We are also committed to see that reconciliation takes place.  If it the duty of this Commission to effect reconciliation, we request that the Commission assist us in reconciling with the family members in a proper manner.\n\tWe request that the Commission tries means of contacting the members of the families so that we can speak with them.  We request that if this is possible, the Commission should assist us in doing so.\n\tIt could happen that maybe we have forgotten some things or maybe others we have expressed not in a correct manner, but what we have explained here is what we remember to the best of our ability.  We request the Commission to assist us in achieving reconciliation because I think one of the main objectives of this Commission is reconciliation.\n\tThank you.",

That is when I started to speak the truth as I knew it regarding the crimes that I was being sentenced for.\n\tThereafter I went with the Investigation Task Unit headed by Col Dobson.  I walked with him for quite a long time so that these issues could be investigated and cleared.  They have a full report about all these incidents that I have mentioned in these proceedings.\n\tI also from August 4 last year I appeared before a hearing at the Durban Christian Centre before the Violation of Human Rights Committee of the TRC.  We requested to appear before this committee and explain all these issues with the intention of reconciliation as I am here before this forum today.\n\tEven at prison I am in a committee together with Romeo Mbambo.  We represent IFP prisoners in reconciliation with ANC prisoners.  If I can just mention this: there are a lot of people who are in prison who are responsible for such actions as similar to ours.  But organisations today are not interested in those people.  They are speaking about peace processes, but are not concerned about the foot soldiers who carried out these activities.  They are involved at the top level in reconciliation.  They speak about this in the media but they don't say anything about families of the victims and about the perpetrators themselves.\n\tWe need counselling because this affects you mentally, psychologically.  Nobody has come forth to suggest how we can get this counselling, how the element of criminality can be rooted out; how we can become human again.  But instead they are speaking of peace packages that have nothing to do with us; the people who carried out these activities.  So there are a lot of prisoners who were involved in such activities.\n\tWe have committed ourselves to affect reconciliation with ANC prisoners with whom we had been fighting in the community.  We are trying to affect reconciliation between the foot soldiers so that we are not left behind.\n\tBecause if this happens, when we are released or if we are released and we are still people who perceive ourselves as enemies, therefore it is useless for politicians to reconcile whereas foot soldiers are still in a war situation.\n\tThese foot soldiers all need counselling.  They also need traditional rights.  The foot soldiers should also be able to reconcile, so we have created this committee of reconciliation with the ANC.\n\tWe have contacted Mr Hlengwam, an IFP leader and informed him of this procedure, of this process.  We plan to call the media so that we can make statements to the media.  And the ANC prisoners will do the same.\n\tThe ANC has planned to call Mr Willison Ncono to inform him of this process.  He has been to the prison quite a few times to speak to ANC prisoners.  Mr Hlangwa also visited us in prison with regards to this process.  Mr Dingele, another IFP leader has also visited us twice regarding this process of reconciliation with ANC prisoners.\n\tAlthough we had not reached a situation where we could call youth leaders as well, because we intend calling the youth president of the IFP and one of the ANC to address IFP and ANC prisoners alike.  And we also want to send them to the youth of the two organisations to affect reconciliation and to affect an awareness campaign.

I was not only referring to the IFP as a movement.  What I said yesterday was that these political movements in their different areas and sections, they had a tendency to collect moneys from the community.\n\tNot only the IFP.  This was a common practice, to collect money from the communities so that for example within the IFP they would refer to the people collecting the money as \"utheleweni\".  They would actually refer to themselves as the ones who protect the community.  The moneys would therefore be used to buy arms, ammunitions and some traditional herbs for protection.\n\tI did not say that these moneys were used to sustain the Caprivians because they were protecting people.

Because to the family there is no way we find that the assassination was politically motivated.  It was just a misunderstanding between the police in the execution of their functions.  They were not trusting one another and as such they decided to assassinate one another in case there was any suspicion.\n\tIn that regard we would like to have all implicated parties be subpoenaed.  That is Brig Mzimela, Maj Langeni, Mrs Mbuyazi and the rest.\n\tAnd the other thing we would like to have, to allow the law to take its course as far as the docket that was opened is concerned.  It must be re-opened and as such to allow these people who avail themself to fall in, so that we see and challenge the evidence within that.\n\tAnd there is no way that as the bereaved members will believe that assassination taking place between the members of the police which is supposed to be serving its own nation at that time betrayed one another.  And killing, even in the Bible or by God is totally condemned.  And prosecution of all implicated, plus yourself, Mr Khize and your colleagues has not taken place where the docket was opened.\n\tWe want to see justice or the law taking its course accordingly in this matter.  The deceased, that is Sgt Khumalo, did not give us any opportunity to give us a mandate as to what to say here and not to say here.\n\tYou are lucky Mr Mkhize that you are alive and you can lead evidence the way it suits you.   But our brother is not available here on earth to put his case forward as you have done.\n\tAt the funeral of our brother the members of the Kwazulu police concerned participated unbelievably.  They were all showing their interest, showing their sympathy; their empathy with the whole family.  Even Brig Mzimela was one of the people who actually contributed a goat.  According to our culture Mr Chairman, when somebody has died there is a lot of slaughtering that takes place just to get people to get meat and the rest of the eating that has to take place.  So he was the first one to contribute that.  But today he is the same person who is implicated by Mr Mkhize.\n\tAnd the rest of the members participated in that funeral.  They wanted us to believe that the killers were not among the hit squad within their operation.  And today it is clearly showing that our brother was assassinated by his colleagues.
