The comrade, Carl Niehaus was from the National Executive, there was Bheki Cele who was a Deputy Secretary in the province at the time.\n\tThere was Sanso Nxunu who was the First Secretary of the ANC.  There was a mass meeting of all the ANC comrades in church hall in the prison.  That is when I first heard about the cases where comrades were involved, almost half of them, and the complaints that the comrades had, we heard about them on that particular day.\n\tAs usual the MK members in prison, Lucky Sithole would be the one who would represent all the MK cadres in prison.  Their living conditions and the ANC activities, he would talk about those, and he would even talk about the integration after they are released and about their pensions.

Not in the caucus, but he stated that specifically in that mass meeting he was open about it, and then he said after coming from the exile, they were given instructions by the Commanders to commit crimes like robbery in order to help the organisation.\n\tBut the very same organisation now is in power and is doing nothing to help them get amnesty.   The responses came from comrades like Carl Niehaus, who said the ANC had given itself time to change all the laws, concerning indemnity.  Early in 1996 they promised that a TRC body would be established.  Everybody who was in prison for politically motivated crimes, they should use the opportunity to apply for amnesty, and these people should reveal everything that they know.\n\tThat was the only first forum that was established by the ANC government, it was this TRC.",

I was in prison at the time.  The manner in which things were happening, was very disorganised.  There was no formal structure like the TRC.  I am one of the people who applied.  The prison warder would fill in the form for you, if you would try and show that you know something about politics, at least you would get a form, but there would be additional statements that had to be done by the prison warders and in their own handwriting.\n\tI actually think that the ANC did not like this process of indemnity, nationally.  That is why there was a problem in 1992 in September.   The indemnity did not make any move to release the ANC prisoners, because this was just a cover up to save the National Party prisoners, the ANC submitted a list of about 1500 people who were in prison, but only 40 people were released, and those people were criminals.  The people who were arrested for political activities, were still in jail.\n\tThat is why this TRC body was established, this was the only platform where all the people who were arrested for political reasons, would be released.  As far as I am concerned, this indemnity was not such a good process at all.\n\tIncluding the Indemnity Act of 1992, was not a good process.",

The ANC  President, the current President was the one who had been to the ANC, to the TRC, for submissions, submissions that were covering each and every activity of the ANC.\n\tIf the TRC is considering Mr Sithole's application, they would use those that were covered in the submission.  I would also like to request the TRC to take a note, this is not for the first time for me to come here to the TRC, long before the establishment of this TRC, Lucky Sithole had mentioned something like instructions.  I remember at some stage he was very, very angry, he staged a walkout.  It is not for the first time that he speaks here about the instructions that were given to him by the ANC, he started talking about that as early as 1995.\n\tI would further request that the TRC when considering his application, should take note of those issues.  As a person who was a former Chairperson of the ANC in prison, all these applications were in my hands, all the members of the ANC who were in prison in KwaZulu Natal, were in my hand.  I started working with them while I was in prison.  When I was released in this year in March, the ANC gave me a portfolio of going ahead with these applications, up until the last date of the TRC.\n\tI am so used to communicating with the TRC office in Cape Town.  There are problems that sometimes I would be told that a person did not get amnesty, but the same person would be called again, because of some problems.  I am not sure whether there is a communication breakdown or not.  The example of Dannyboy, I received a letter that Dannyboy, his application was turned down, but yesterday he was here to appear before the TRC.  I think that I know more about Sithole and the others' applications.  I am not hearing about them for the first time here.",

And then Mr Chairman, what had happened is, based on that affidavits, the TRC then said to, actually by means of a letter, to both these applicants that it seems as if they had applied unilaterally, one application, and the necessary applications will then have to be made to a Committee who hears the matter.\n\tThe TRC then confirmed that they didn't have any written application before them.  So what has happened is, when the matter came before the Committee on a previous occasion, I think it was in March this year, the Committee was then appraised of the situation and the two applicants at that stage were not represented.  It was at that stage, after that adjournment, that we became involved in the matter, upon receiving instructions from Mr Shandu and Mr Malevu.\n\tThey said to us that the contents of this affidavit was put to them, because by that stage we had received the previous bundle that was prepared in this matter.  They said to us that these affidavits incorrectly represent the position, in that there was a misunderstanding at some level, between themselves and the Investigators who took down these affidavits.\n\tThey then said to me that they wrote out their applications, it was sent to prison authorities and they had each done this on their individual forms.   The High Court papers which were then submitted to the NPD were then drawn on the same lines.",

Now, I don't know whether it is necessary, but I would wish them to come if possible, and state the correct position because all of them are Zulu speakers and I am not sure whether there is a suggestion that maybe there was a misunderstanding, in terms of language, but because it is clearly stated what they said.\n\tI think it would be necessary to call the people who also took the statement.",
