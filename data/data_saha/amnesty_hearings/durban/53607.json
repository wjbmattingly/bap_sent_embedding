            "It's in fact not terribly much, Mr Chairman, it's about 30 pages.\n\tMr Chairman, coming then to the issues before you now, we have the situation where Vorster tells you and we know is common cause, that one of the most important aspects of the quest in the conflicts of the past was the question of information.  He's referred to the circular in his amnesty application, where the need to recruit informers was specifically mentioned.  We know that one of the reasons why the Security Forces were as successful as they were during the conflict of the past, was primarily because of their ability to recruit informers of all sorts and shapes and were able to take pre-emptive action or proactive action and thereby sustain the government of the day.\n\tMr Chairman, it was no different in the present case, except for one factor and that is that according to the evidence of Mr Vorster, he had received an indication from his informer, Goodwill Sikhakane, that this particular victim, Mr Cele, was interested or was willing to become an informer.  As Mr Botha said, well that made it an extra incentive then to approach Mr Cele.  The way in which they did it, Mr Chairman, and this we have seen also in the case of Ndwandwe, was where the person was outside the borders of the country he would abducted and attempts would be made to recruit that person to become an informer.  \n\tThe process, Mr Chairman, of that recruitment has been discussed in previous amnesty applications.  We saw fit not to do so again, but in essence it's a matter of common sense.  When you recruit a person you have to inform him of contact points, contact persons etc., and in a sense you lay bare your own information network to that person.  That in turn implies that before you do so you have to have complete faith as far as it is humanly possible, that the person is genuine when he indicates that he will work with the Security Police, in order not as it were, to blow your own cover.  \n\tIn the case of Cele this did not happen except to the limited extent of Goodwill.  His cover was clearly blown the moment he enticed Cele to get into the kombi and thereafter was abducted and Goodwill was left behind in Swaziland.  Clearly if the operation, the attempts to recruit Cele would be unsuccessful, Goodwill's situation would clearly be compromised if Mr Cele would have been released thereafter.  Which in turn formed one of the options which was considered at the end of the day by Vorster and Taylor and perhaps to a lesser extent by Wasserman, although he said he associated himself therewith, in deciding that Cele had to be eliminated.\n\tNow Mr Chairman, I'm not going to repeat the evidence, you heard the evidence.  What we would like to submit to you is that there appears to be no material conflicts on the evidence, the real question here would turn around perhaps proportionality.  As far as the political background in concerned, Mr Chairman, we submit that there can also be very little doubt that these policemen didn't do so because they had nothing else to do, but they did so in order to do their duties, perform their duties as they saw it as policemen, in order to sustain the government.\n\tOne can argue about the merits or demerits of the method of wanting to recruit an informer and then going about it in the way in which the applicants did, namely entering Swaziland and abducting that person.  Well Mr Chairman, of course in those times people were killed on both sides of the line and you have heard evidence time and time and again on many occasions, of the risky position in which informers found themselves.  \n\tMs Thabethe suggested why instead of abducting him, that is Mr Cele, didn't you simply send Goodwill to go and talk to him and ask him whether he's prepared to work with the police.  Well that would have been a crazy suggestion, Mr Chairman, because if Mr Cele - if he had misread Mr Cele, he would have signed his own death warrant by doing so, because he would have exposed himself.\n\tIt is also clear, Mr Chairman, that members of the Security Police couldn't go into Swaziland and attempt to recruit him there, they would be off their normal domestic ground, they would not know what situations they would encounter there and by far the safest would be to bring them back to the Republic of South Africa.\n\tThis in turn, Mr Chairman, brings up this whole question of the accord which was entered into between the South African Government and the Swazi Government.  We hear about this accord, Mr Chairman, but frankly, speaking from our side, we have never heard any evidence presented at any of these hearings that the Swazi Government allowed a free hand to the South African Security Forces in Swaziland.",

            "MR VISSER",
            "Yes.  Yes, that certainly is our impression.  We may be right, we may be wrong, but it accords with your impression.  Certainly from an interstateal agreement point of view there is no evidence which we are aware of that suggests that members of the Security Forces of this country could enter Swaziland and act unhindered, one rather gets the impression as you've just pointed out, that perhaps in government as you've pointed out, but certainly in the Police Force in Swaziland, there were certain people placed in certain positions that were sympathetic to the cause.\n\tAnd if one had to speculate, Mr Chairman, and I don't want to go too far off the beaten track, but if one had to speculate, one would imagine that if the Swazi Government had a real problem with a person who is incidentally also the enemy of the South African Government, they would have turned a blind eye to any action taken against such person in Swaziland.\t\n\tBut for all practical purposes, Mr Chairman, it's quite clear that the applicants in the present case went into Swaziland.  Although they entered legally through the border gate, what they did in Swaziland they did stealthily.  It wasn't as if there was a normal arrest, a taking to a police station, a booking of Mr Cele etc., nothing of the kind, he was abducted, it was done stealthily.\n\tNow Mr Chairman, Mr Cele is now taken out of Swaziland and as Vorster said to everyone's surprise, he was not amenable to work with the South African Police.  In fact, Vorster says that he thought that he had been misled by Goodwill.  Be that as it may, the fact of the matter is that there was - as was exactly the case with Portia Ndwandwe, suddenly a dilemma.  The dilemma was twofold in regard to releasing him, and that is the position of Goodwill.  \n\tAnd of course here the Security Branch had a man who was a high-ranking official by all accounts in MK, and which they would not be able to release because the whole point of the war was to eliminate, and I use that in the broader sense of the word, not necessarily killing, but to eliminate people in key positions in order to bring disarray in the organisation of the opposing enemy.\n\tSo Mr Chairman, at Amsterdam it doesn't work, Vorster says that the intention was if he would be amenable to be recruited, he would be replaced in Swaziland as soon as possible for him to start operating.  Clearly, that makes good sense as well because once a person stays away fro any length of time, some people might start asking for explanations and for reasons.  So one can't find fault with that intention expressed by Vorster.\n\tNow at Amsterdam the plan does not come to fruition, he's taken down to Pietermaritzburg, he is by all accounts for the better part of the day, further interrogated and attempts were made to recruit him at the farm near Elandskop without success, Taylor then speaks to Vorster and Wasserman and says \"We've got a problem and it seems to me that we're going to have to eliminate this gentleman because he doesn't want to co-operate.  We can't release him, we can't charge him and this seems to be the only way out\".  And that is what then came to pass.  We don't need to go into the details, Chairperson, but you heard the somewhat emotional evidence of Mr Wasserman, of how exactly it came about and what happened thereafter.\n\tMr Chairman, we submit with respect, that bearing in mind the bigger picture of the conflict, the political conflict of the past, and bearing in mind what Mr Cele stood for, not in the sense of his person, but in the sense of his organisation and particularly the fact that it was an MK member, that the act was proportional to the objective that was sought to be achieved, and that was first of all to eliminate him as a key person in the MK machinery and secondly, to protect the identity of Goodwill Sikhakane.\n\tNow Mr Chairman, we are in possession now of certain decisions that have come down.  I referred to them earlier.  Mr Chairman very briefly, referring to the decision in the Jack Cronje application, 2773/96, we would rely on particularly what was stated from pages 1 to page 4.  The original Amnesty Committee of which you are the Chairman, dealt with many of the aspects, Chairperson, which place the actions of members of the Security Forces in perspective.  And we don't need to read it to you again, Chairperson, you're very well aware of the decision, having been part of it, other than to say that we rely on - actually it's page 1 to 6, and we would ask you to incorporate the decision there taken also in - as far as the principles are concerned, in our application presently before you.\n\tNow Mr Chairman, there was at one stage some argument before another Amnesty Committee as to the binding effect or otherwise of amnesty decisions which had been handed down.  We were the first and we still are the first to concede that a Commission of Inquiry and also this particular Amnesty Committee is not a Court of law, where its judgments have precedence and have to be followed unless clearly wrong.  But Mr Chairman, and I'm certain I don't have to convince you of this point, one would expect that in the interests of reasonable administrative action, one would expect - and of course also from a point of view of certainty, one would expect other Amnesty Committees to follow what was stated in decisions of previous decisions.\n\tMr Chairman, in that vein we refer you to the Khotso House incident amnesty decision for one reason only.  You will recall that until very recently we grappled with the problem of the wording of Section 20(2)(b), because on the plain wording it would seem to indicate that the legislature had in mind with its authorisation which it specifies in that sub-section, that the act, omission or offence had to be authorised before it could be stated that it fell within the express or implied mandate of the security member who acted.  And you will recall, Mr Chairman, that for a long time in our argument when we addressed this sub-section, we referred you to what appeared to us to be an inherent paradox, because the paradox being that amnesty may only be granted for acts and omissions which are also offences.  And certainly as you put it in the Kondile case to General Erasmus, no act existed at the time which authorised any policemen to kill Mr Kondile.  \tNow in the matter of the Khotso House bombing, Mr Chairman, there is a part of the judgment which deals very specifically for the first time, with the wording of sub-section 20(2)(b).  I might just tell you how it came about, Mr Chairman.  We appeared a week or two before the judgment came out, or perhaps even longer, before this judgment came out, in Johannesburg in other amnesty applications before a Panel of the Amnesty Committee, which inter alia included Adv de Jager and Adv Gcabashe.  During that hearing the merits of, and the interpretation of (b) of Section 20(2) was argued, I may add, quite hotly so, and we then asked for permission, for time to prepare a proper argument and we did so and that argument was presented to that Committee.  As it turns out, Mr Chairman, it would appear that in the Khotso House matter this argument that was presented in another matter, as I've just explained to you, was included in this decision probably because two of the Commissioners, two of the four Commissioners in the Khotso House incident, were Adv de Jager and Adv Gcabashe.  \n\tSo Mr Chairman, what we submit to you is that from page 5 of that decision, which you no doubt have, we submit you will find a correct interpretation of sub-section 20(2)(b), starting with authorities such as MKHIZE vs MARTINS in 1914AD referring to British law and running up to 1945AD in FELDMAN'S case, which appeared to us, with respect Mr Chairman, still the existing law in our country.  We are not going to repeat it, Chairperson, we merely wish to direct your attention to the fact that we believe that there is now a correct interpretation of that sub-section before you and we would ask you with respect, to follow that interpretation as presented in the Khotso House matter.\nIf you don't have a copy of the Khotso House decision, Chairperson, we can make one available.",

And the relevant part, Mr Chairman, runs from page 5 - sorry - yes from page 5 to page 8.\n\tMr Chairman, perhaps lastly, we were struck by some similarities between the present case, the facts of the present case and that of the one which you presided in concerning Mr Kondile.  You will recall, Mr Chairman, that in Kondile's case he was first arrested when he came across the Swazi border.  There was some suggestion under false pretences.  He was arrested by the Security Branch in Bloemfontein and then he was placed over to Port Elizabeth.  At Port Elizabeth he was assaulted and eventually he ostensibly agreed to become an informer.  Du Plessis was the person who dealt with him.  And he told you at the time that Mr Kondile indicated that he would become an informer and he, that is du Plessis, believed him, believed that he was genuine and started exposing some contact persons to him and some information routes, after which, on a particular day when du Plessis went to visit Kondile, he sat on his bed and he found a note which was written by Kondile and which was obviously intended to be smuggled out of the prison, in which he informed the ANC that he was assaulted and compelled to agree to become an informer, but that he wasn't going to become such an informer and that he would report to them the moment he is released.\n\tYou will recall, Mr Chairman, that a decision was then taken together the then Brig van Rensburg and Gen Erasmus, and it was decided that in the circumstances they couldn't release him, they couldn't charge him and therefore they eliminated him.  And that decision, Chairperson, has also come to hand, it is under AC/99/0037, where you as I said before, were the Chairperson and where you were assisted by Judge Pillay and Adv Gcabashe and Adv de Jager.\n\tAnd we submit, Mr Chairman, that your decision in the Kondile matter finds application to a great extent in the present case, the only difference being that in this case Mr Cele did not indicate that he was prepared to become an informer after he was abducted, but apart from that and apart from the degree of the assault, Mr Chairman, there appears to be very little difference between the two matters.  And we would ask you in the light of the decision in Kondile's case, to favourably consider granting the amnesty as prayed for also in the present case.\n\tWhat was impressive, if I may say so Mr Chairman, about the decision in the Kondile case, is that it showed the insight of the Amnesty Committee in placing the assaults on Mr Kondile in proper perspective vis-a-vis his killing.  And that we found very interesting, Mr Chairman.  And again we say with respect, that we ask you with respect, to deal with the assault in this case albeit it of a far minor nature, in the same sense, Mr Chairman.

The Act in fact does give indications that that must be so.  The Act speaks of \"committed inside or outside the country\" etc. \n\tNow clearly, if you granted amnesty in the present case and these applicants went to Swaziland for a weekend to celebrate, they might find themselves being arrested and they won't be able to rely on your amnesty which you granted them.  But that must not be held to stand in the way of you doing your duty in terms of the Act, as we submitted before and as we now submit again.\n\tIn what we will give Commissioner Bosman tomorrow, there is towards the end a little heading dealing with that issue as well, Mr Chairman.  Suffice is it to submit to you that the fact that an incident took place partly within the country and partly outside the country is no - now I'm looking for a word, there's no bar to you granting amnesty.  Actually I was hoping Commissioner Bosman was going to give me the latin word.",

The victims were listening.\n\tThirdly, Mr Chair, they've raised a concern that the applicants don't show any remorse, they believe that they didn't show that they were sorry.
