<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> There was violence in Eshowe between the IFP and the ANC.  I then got into contact with the IFP leader in the location, Mr Dlulane.  At that time, I ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can you just give us the name of this person again, Mr who?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Mr Dlulane Nyawuza.  He is the driver of uMntwana Gideon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Why did you get in touch with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> We planned that we had to attack the ANC  supporters who intended to disrupt the election in the location Eshowe.  We then agreed to do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You talked about doing what to ANC members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> We had to shoot them because they were also shooting the IFP members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry I didn't get the interpreter.  You talked about doing what to the ANC members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> ...(inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Stamping out?</p>

<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> We started attacking them.  Mr Nyawuza would drive me in his Mazda, and leave me at a certain place, where I would shoot people.  I was with another boys from Enseleni, namely Vusi Myeza and Phazimani ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you arrived where?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> When we arrived at Nyanini, we destroyed there because they had killed Mbeshe Mahaye.  He was killed near the bottle store.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Mr Myeza I just want to take you back to your joining of the IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I joined the IFP when we were paying for the cards.  That was long ago.  In the beginning of the 90's we were given another card written Inkatha Freedom Party.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> What was your reason for initially joining the IFP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I joined the IFP because the people in the area where I was living belonged to the same party.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> When you grew up did you grow up in the traditional Zulu way or did you grow up in a western style?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Traditional way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Did you also comply with the Zulu customs for example slaughtering animals and having the traditional ceremonies?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> The first incident that you apply for amnesty for is the killing of Mr Zikhali. Can you give us the detail of how that happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes.  Mr Dlulane who was the leader of the IFP in the location took us to the Security Branch policeman, Thusi's house.  I was with Vusi Myeza ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think that rather that we have a sequential account, so if possible put your questions in such a way that you go step by step. I have an idea we are getting a somewhat disjointed explanation.  Let's just talk about when was the decision taken to attack Zikhali, who took that decision, how was it taken, and then proceed as to precisely what was done. Very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Yes Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Will you please do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> The decision to kill Mr Zikhali was taken when we had a meeting.  We had to plan how we were going to shoot him because he was eluding us.  We had been looking for him for some time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just hold on. I want you to understand that what you are saying has to be translated to us in English so you have to talk in such a way that you give the translator time to translate what you are saying. Do you understand?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And I think that the translator, she finds or he finds that his evidence is being given too fast he or she should remind the speaker to slow down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Mr Myeza when you had this meeting ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He said: "We took a decision to kill him."  I think that you should ask him now who is we.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Indeed Mr Chairman that is exactly my question now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a>	When you took this decision who was at that meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Mr Nyawuza was chairing the meeting.  The people who were present were Vusi Myeza, Sbu Zuma and myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> And who was the person leading this meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Just before you get there ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Mr Nyawuza was given instructions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> And what was decided at this meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Just before you get to the decision, who were these people, who was Dlulane?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Sorry?</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Who is this Mr Nyawuza Dlulane?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> He is the driver of uMntwana Gideon.  He was the leader of the IFP in Gezinsila location.  I reported to him when I came to the location and the IFP members whose houses had been burnt were accommodated by him in his scrap yard.  He was also providing them with food.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And who was Sbu Zuma?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Zuma was just an IFP member.  He was staying at Mandini.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Very well take it from there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a>	Why was the decision taken that Mr Zikhali had to die, what was the reason for that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Mr Zikhali was the ANC member.  People from Nyanini who were ANC members could no longer enter the location at that time, but Mr Zikhali used to drive his car, fetch the people from Nyanini and bring them in the location.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> And when he came into your area what did he do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> After bringing these boys in the location, IFP members would than be killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just explain this to me, because the deceased would come into your area which is an IFP area people would die. What does that mean, how would people die just because a man came there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Mr Zikhali was not the one who was doing the shooting.  This was done by the people he brought in the location from Nyanini.  At 10 pm, Mr Zikhali used to go fetch the Kentucky/Chicken Licken staff members from their place of the employment in town.  He would then visit his girlfriend who stayed at Ntuli cottages.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> And did you have information stating that or is it just a suspicion that you had?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What did you see it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Or did you see that happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> This was not just a suspicion.  He used to bring people in the location.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Did you see that happen or did you get information from somewhere else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I once saw him doing it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Okay and what was the decision taken at ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Sorry just before you. What did you see happening, him bringing people into the area or killing people in the area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> On the first day, on Saturday, a Ndlovu boy was shot and killed in the scrap yard.  This happened after Zikhali has brought the ANC boys, like Schoolboy, in the location.  The Eshowe police came there and instead of making arrests, they just continued shooting.  Mr Zikhali thereafter drove off and left the scene.  Nobody was arrested there.  This happened during the day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Regarding the killing of this boy ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Were you there, did you see this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes, I was present.  I saw it happening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just stop there.  When this man came into the area with other people was there a fight between his people and the people in the area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes, a fight would ensue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And was it as a result of that fight that this Ndlovu boy died?</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes, he died during that fight.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were there other people that were involved in that fight?</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> From which party?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You have to have two groups of people if there has to be a fight isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> It was the IFP and ANC members fighting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes and were you part of the IFP that took part in the fight on that day when Ndlovu died?</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> These boys were brought on that day and they alighted near Mr Nyawuza's scrap yard.  I was from the shop on that day and I saw this car driving past.  These boys were ten.  They walked toward the scrap yard and I then heard gunshots being fired by these boys who alighted from Zikhali's car.  Zikhali then drove off.  This IFP boy was left there.  The police arrived and intervened.  One of the ANC boys died at the scene was found by the heard boy the following day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you were not involved in that fight?</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> No, I was not personally involved on that day because I did not have a firearm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Alright, now it as a result of this fight that Ndlovu boy died that you people took a decision about Zikhali?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Sorry Mr Alberts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a>	Could I just take you back.  What time of day did this happen on that Saturday?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> It was during the day, in full view of the public.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And you said that the body was discovered only the next day, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did you run away yourself when you heard the shots?</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes, I also ran away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did you see the shooting or did you just hear the shots?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I saw where the firing was taking place.  Not that I heard.  I ran away after Ntokozo Ndlovu of the IFP was shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You can't run away because the Ndlovu boy died because you did not know the Ndlovu boy, his body was only discovered the following day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> No, I did not say the body of Ndlovu was found the following day, I said the body of one of the ANC boys, who was shot when the police arrived there, was found the following day.  Ndlovu boy's body was taken by the police on the same day he was shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Just to get this clear, did you see the body of the Ndlovu boy on that same day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Was that only after you went back to see what has happened after the shooting had ended?</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> When I came back after the police have arrived, it was after all the shooting had ceased.  I then saw the police removing the body of this Ndlovu boy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Was it because of the shooting that you initially ran away?</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes, I ran away because of the shooting.  It was also because I knew that they were also looking for me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> When you saw this kombi did you also see Mr Zikhali at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> The car was driven by him on that day, not by his driver.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Okay let's go back to the meeting that you had.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Let me just get a bit more of the picture, the background. You say you knew they were looking for you, why were they at that stage looking for you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> It was because I was an IFP member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But there are millions of IFP members, they weren't looking for all the IFP members were they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> That is true.  I was a person well known in the location because I was vocal.  I used to approach people and tell them to stop what they were doing because they might find themselves in trouble in future.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Had you in the past attacked ANC people and that is why they were looking for you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Before that, we became involved in skirmishes with the ANC people.  This happened during the day and it was after the ANC members had killed a lot of people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you say we I am talking about you. I am talking about you, did you yourself ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I was involved, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you were known to them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I knew that they were looking for me because there were other people who came from Pietermaritzburg on that day.  I was a known person then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And so you think that on that day they may have been looking for you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> They did not say but I could see by their actions that they were looking for me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> They didn't tell you that we are looking for you, you just assumed that they were looking for you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> This scrap yard that was attacked is where a lot of IFP members were staying.  Their houses had been burnt at Nyanini and Mr Nyawuza had given them a shelter there.  He built shacks for them there.  This is the place then, that was always attacked by the ANC members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But you couldn't have seen from their actions because when the shooting took place you were away from them. There was a shooting and you hid and you looked at it. So how could you see that they were looking for you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I knew that they were looking for me because they had shot at me before.  This happened a day after I was chased by people with firearms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The question was relating to you.  I am talking about you, how did you know that they were looking for you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I knew because they shot at me before.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Alright, carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> The shooting incidents that you mentioned between you and the ANC before this incident of the Ndlovu boy, where did that take place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> It happened in the location near Nsibande's house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Is that in the IFP area or in the ANC area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> This was an IFP area.  There is also an ANC area in the location but is far.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> And how did you become involved in those shootings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I was involved with Mr Dlulane because I was a resident in the location.  One could not stay in the location if one was not an IFP member.  You had to move out of the area.  I stayed there because I am a boy from KwaZulu.  I had to look for myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> What I am trying to get at, when this previous shootings took place who was doing the attacking?</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> ANC members were the ones who was doing the attacking.</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> And were you shooting at them in defence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I was shot because I was defending myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Okay let's go back to the meeting regarding Mr Zikhali, was only Mr Zikhali discussed at that meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Because of what Mr Zikhali did, we sat down and planned what we were going to do about him.  He could move in and out of both areas whilst we could not do that.  We realised that he was no longer involved with taxis as a taxis operator, but was now involved in politics.  We planned how we were going to attack him.  We were four when we planned, but there were only three of us who attacked him.  We then went to ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Just hold on a second.  Was it a decision that was made between the four of you or was there somebody taking the lead and in fact eventually giving an order?</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> The person who was taking decisions was not there when we went to do this.  After dropping us at a certain place, he drove to his house and waited there for us to phone him.  That is Mr Dlulane.</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> And when was it decided that this killing were to take place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I think he was supposed to be killed in January 1993.  This, however, did not happen as we planned.  On this day then, we knew that his car had gone to the casino and we saw him being dropped somewhere by his driver.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When was this decision taken, when?</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Mr Chairman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When was this decision taken?</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Yes when was the decision taken to have Mr Zikhali killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I cannot remember, but I remember that he was finally shot on a Sunday at about 8pm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> I see the date of death as indicated on the inquest document is the 21st of November of 1993, how long before the incident did you come to this decision?</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> It took a long time.  We started planning to kill him in 1992 and he was killed in 1993.  We could not get him at that time, and violence intensified in 1993 in the location and IFP members were killed without any reason, and I was also shot.  I do not know why they were being attacked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr Myeza, - Sorry Mr Alberts, I am just trying to get an idea when he was killed in relation to the decision taken.  We have the dates, end of 1993 he was killed and you say in 1992 the decision was taken, can we try and approach this differently?</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> When you took the decision to kill Zikhali what did you do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> We were still deciding whether to kill him or talk to him so that he could stop what he was doing.  I then said to Mr Nyawuza ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> No.  Sorry for interrupting.  Let's accept that you have now taken the decision, after the discussion he was to be killed, that decision was now taken, what did you then do to implement the decision?</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> There is nothing else we did other than to kill him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You waited nearly a year to do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes, because we could not get hold of him.  We only managed to get him when we heard that he had a girlfriend staying in Ntuli's cottages in the location.</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> How did this girlfriend assist you in killing him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Before we got hold of Mr Zikhali, our intention was to kill a Security Branch policeman.  When we went to his house, we were disturbed by a dog, and that policeman came out of his house with an R4 rifle.  We then ran away.  As we were running away, we saw Mr Zikhali accompanied by his girlfriend.  She was taking him to the bus stop where he was going to wait for his kombi to pick him up.  Vusi Myeza, without asking him anything, then shot him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Can I just go back to my previous question, did the girlfriend actually assist you in killing or is it just the fact that you saw him with his girlfriend that assisted you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> No, his girlfriend did not assist us in anyway.  She left him at the bus stop and went back into her house.  We then got a chance to shoot him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Was it just by chance that you now saw him somewhere where you could get to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes, because he was walking on foot and not in his car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Okay tell us in detail what happened after you saw him going to the bus stop or rather to the taxi rank?</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> We followed him because we were on the road.  We then saw his girlfriend leaving him alone, and we then used the opportunity to attack him.  Myeza then shot him once in his chest.  We then left.  These boys ran to the scrap yard and I went to Mr Nyawuza's house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay before we go to the details about where you went after the shooting, just give me some details about who was the person that did the shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Vusi Myeza.</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you also armed with a gun?</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes, I had a firearm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You didn't fire?</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I did not shoot on that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So after he was shot what happened to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> After he was shot, we ran away.  I went to Nyawuza's house while these other boys went to Regina Gcabashe.  I did not tell Mr Nyawuza of what we had done.  Regina Gcabashe then phoned Mr Nyawuza and informed him that the boys had told her that they had been attacked.  Mr Nyawuza and myself then got into his car to go and fetch these boys.  Mr Nyawuza handed his shot gun to me ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think that this is becoming a little confusing.  Do you understand what is being said, are you getting a comprehensive picture of what he is saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Mr Chairman, no not quite.</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well now why are you allowing it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Yes Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Please I want you to understand that I would like this step by step.  You have told us that after the shooting your friend Myeza and his companion went to somebody else's house, they went to that scrap yard and they went to somebody else's house.  You went to Mr Dludlani and you reported to him that this man Zikhali had been killed, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Oh I thought you said: "I went and reported to Dludlani?</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> No, I did not tell him.  A short time after my arrival the phone rang.</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Alright so you went to Mr Dludlani's house and what did you do there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I kept quiet because there was females around.  We did not want them to know what we were doing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Alright I don't want an explanation. What was the next thing that happened while you were at Mr Dludlani's house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Regina Gcabashe who stay near the scrap yard then phoned and asked Mr Nyawuza to go and fetch the boys because they were being attacked.  Mr Nyawuza then took his shotgun and gave it to me, and we went there.  We found Vusi and Sbu Zuma and took them away.  As we were driving past the place where we had shot Mr Zikhali, we saw the police taking his body away.  We stopped our car to take a look, and Mr Nyawuza praised us for a job well done.</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Could you just please slow down a little so we can follow it?  Would you tell us again, you went in the car to fetch Vuzi Myeza and Zuma?</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And then you said something about the police taking the body?</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Let's put it this way, where did you go to after you picked Vuzi Myeza and Zuma up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> We were on our way back to Mr Nyawuza's house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And what happened there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> We went to sit at Mr Nyawuza's house, just to see whom did the police suspect.  We realised that the police were not suspecting anyone of us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> My question was not all that, not what you suspected, my question was when you went to Nyawuza's place what happened if anything?</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Nothing else happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were the police there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> There were no police at Nyawuza's house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were the police in the vicinity of Nyawuza's place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> The police came and took Mr Zikhali's body.</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You saw them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> They picked up the body of Zikhali?</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> There was no further shooting on that day in that area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> No, there was no further shooting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Nothing further happened on that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Nothing happened until the following morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Right then that is the end of that chapter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Yes Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Sorry could I just get one follow up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a>	You said there was a telephone call from Regina Gcabashe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You went to fetch Vusi and Zuma, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You went to Mr Nyawuza's place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Is his place close to the scrap yard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> It is not that close to the scrap yard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So did you not go and investigate the attack that Mrs Gcabashe phoned about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> We had gone to fetch the boys, not that we went to investigate the attack.  We knew what had happened there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Were the boys at Mrs Gcabashe's place, Vusi and Zuma?</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> They went into the scrap yard but thereafter went to report to Regina Gcabashe.  She was also helping at the scrap yard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Were they attacked at the scrap yard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> No, they were not being attacked.  This is the trick we use if something has happened in the location.</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> What did you see there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Nothing, we just went to fetch the boys.</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Look here just understand, after the shooting incident when Zikhali was killed you received a telephone call whilst you were at this house from Mrs Gcabashe that there was an attack so you take your friends Vusi Myeza and the other friend of yours and you go there, was there an attack that the telephone call was all about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> No, there was no attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> There was no attack. So on that day there was just this one incident when Zikhali was killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> There was no fighting in the location on that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes can we move on to the next incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Okay the next incident that you applied for amnesty for is that of the killing of a person by the name of Botha, is that the same person as Vusimuzi Mbokazi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Botha was staying in the Ubambiswano School teacher's quarters.  He was just a school attending boy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, just the question is, is he the same person?  Is his full name Vusimuzi Muntukaziboni Mbukazi Botha, is that one person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I do not know his surname.  I know him as Botha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that the only name by which you know him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes do carry on about talking about this killing of Botha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Okay was a decision made to kill this Botha person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes, we took a decision to kill Botha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Who was present when this decision was taken?</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> It was Mr Dlulane, Vusi Myeza and myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> The three of you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> And that is the same three persons that were involved in the meeting regarding Mr Zikhali, is that right?  That is the same people you mentioned when you spoke regarding Zikhali?</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> We were four when we decided to kill Mr Zikhali.</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Yes but that is the same people, three of those people that were mentioned there are the three people you are mentioning now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When was this decision taken?</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I cannot remember the date when Botha was killed, but it was a Saturday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Where was this meeting held?</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> We were at Mr Dlulane's house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> And why was it decided that Botha was to be killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Mr Botha came to Mr Dlulane one day, after it was known that he was friendly to some ANC members.  At that time, IFP supporters were no longer allowed to attend classes at Ubambiswano School.  We were of the opinion that whenever Botha visited Mr Nyawuza's house in our absence, he would gather information and see whether Mr Nyawuza's house was guarded or not.  We then decided, the three of us, that we must do something to him.  We decided to shoot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Okay was this suspicion that you had regarding him being, let's call it a spy, is that something you saw or that you heard or is it just a mere suspicion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> We were not just suspecting.  We knew that when he went to Mr Nyawuza's house when we were not there, he wanted to get some information from the boys who were also staying there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Okay but can you tell me how do you know that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> He was also in the company of the ANC boys, and was not attending IFP meetings in the location.</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> If you say he was extracting information, how did he go about doing that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> He was asking the boys when we were going to a meeting and where.  The boys would then report to us.  Usually, after getting this information, our bus would then be ambushed on the way.  That is how we knew that he was passing information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So what did he do when he gathered this information about where meetings were going to be held, what did he do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> He was telling the ANC people that information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Are you trying to say that is why the bus or how the bus was attacked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> You also spoke about school kids not allowed to go to school, what was this Mr Botha's involvement in that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> He was involved in hitting the IFP youth members, especially the girls.  He was in the forefront.  He used to do this with other boys like Schoolboy and others.</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> What do you mean he was in the forefront, did he do something physically?</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> They used to carry firearms and use to stab schoolgirls on their buttocks.  They were doing this because these children were IFP members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Let's just get this clear, I get a very confused picture from you.  You say he would stop children from going to school, how would he stop children from going to school?</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> The children were attending school at Ubambiswano High School.  When this violence started, they attacked these children and chased them away from the school.  These children could no longer attend school.</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So are you saying that he, this Botha and others would go to school and attack the children and the teachers at school?</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I had warned Botha several times that they should not attack the children because they were just attending school.  I told him that I did not like it.  His reply was that it is because we were "klovas" (derogatory word referring to IFP members).</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you see this happening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you at the school when this happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes, I saw it with my own eyes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So when you see this happening did you not go up to him and ask him why he is attacking the children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I approached him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you were on talking terms with Mr Botha?</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes, we were on talking terms with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What did he say when you asked him not to interfere with the children's schooling, what did he say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> He used to tell me that there was nothing I could do and that I was speaking on their behalf because we were all IFP members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Mr Myeza did he come out clear that he was an ANC member?</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes.  He told me that he was an ANC member and nobody would change him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> So when initially you said it was known that he was an ANC sympathizer, that could not be correct then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I would not know whether he had an ANC membership card, but the were wearing ANC T-shirts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Was this in the location?</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When he went and prevented children at school, he and his friends prevented children from studying at school you saw it, every other Inkatha member in that area, IFP member in the area would see him doing this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes, other people saw them doing it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And they did nothing about it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> The community could do nothing because it was afraid of the ANC children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Schoolboy, their secretary would be present with other boys.</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> The question if I understood it correctly was: did the community, the Inkatha community in the location do nothing when Botha attacked the children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Who came with Botha to tell these children not to go to school, was he on his own?</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Schoolboy, their secretary would be present with other boys.</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Were they from the locatio, the other youths?</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes, they were from the location.</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> This is the youths with Botha who were ...(inaudible) - just leave that till I have finished. Please leave the microphone till I have finished the question because you won't be able to hear me if you switch on yours.  The people who stopped the children from going to school, they were people that Botha was part of, were the others some of the school children or were they coming from outside the location?</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Some of them were also attending school there, and were staying in the location.  Some of them had fled the location and were staying in Nyanini.</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So these were people who came in from the Njanini, they weren't people from your area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> This is one area under the one iNgoso.  It was a location and a missionary that is rural.</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you Mr Alberts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> These people when they came to the school did they just talk to the children or what did they do to chase children out of the school?</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> They would go to this school when children are on the break.  The car would then drop them there and when the children go to the shops to buy, they would then approach them and attack them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Okay and at this meeting you later held what was the decision that you came to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> We decided that he should be shot dead because he did not want peace in the location.  Mr Nyawuza then took out the rounds from ammunition from the firearm we got from another policeman stationed at Eshowe town.  He gave those rounds to Vusi Myeza.  I am the one who knew where this boy was staying and I then led them there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Just before we go onto that.  Was that a decision that was taken unanimously by the three of you or was there an order given?</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> We were just followers of the IFP.  The person in charge was Mr Dlulane.</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Was an order given?</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> How long after this incident was Botha eventually murdered?</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> We did not take a long time, we planned during the day and he was shot that evening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Okay you said you were to point out the house of Botha, when you left the meeting ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes, I went to point where he was staying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> What happened after you left the meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> When we arrived there, we got into the house.  I was with Vusi Myeza.  We talked to him and asked him to show us the room that was to be let.  He did not know the person who was with me.  He then showed us that room that was unoccupied.  He had a candle and Vusi then shot him twice.</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Where was he shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Vusi fired twice.  I think he shot him on the head because Vusi was following him as he was going to show him this room.  We thereafter ran to Mr Nyawuza's house.  We reported this matter to him and he confirmed that he had heard a gunshot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> After a shot was fired what did you then do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Nothing happened after we shot him.  What I remember is that his body was only found by the police the following day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> And did you report to your superiors that the shooting was in fact done?</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Which superiors?</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> This Dludlani.</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes, we told Mr Nyawuza that we had shot him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In point of time when was this killing, do you know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Mr Chairman I see on the inquest it looks like 21/11 or 21/10/93 the person Mbukazi as far as I can gather.</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> 21/11 Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where does that appear Mr Brink?</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Page 47 of the papers about, after identification the deceased: adult male 27 years there is: 21/11/93.</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> If that is in fact the person named Botha. As far as we can gather that is the inquest ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So if that is correct then this happened the day after Zikhali was killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> As far as I can remember Botha is the first person to be killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Did the two incidents happen within a day of each other?</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I cannot say, but I think we killed Botha first, then Zikhali.</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where is the date?</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> I see the date given on the two inquest documents are both 21/11/93.</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a>	What time of the day was Botha killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Botha was killed at about 8:30 pm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Was he alone at his home?</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes, he was staying alone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How old was this person Botha?</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Botha was a little older than me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Can we proceed to the next incident?  The next incident would be the killing of ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Sorry just before you proceed, just this one last question.  Can you remember that Botha and Zikhali, that you killed them on the same day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I cannot remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Can you remember whether you killed them within a week or was it a year apart, what does your memory tell you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> It was the same year, either 1992/93.</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Are you sure that it wasn't on the same day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I am sure it was not on the same day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You see the court papers record that they were both shot, they give you the date of death as being the 21st of November 1993.</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> That is not true, they were not killed on the same day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well since you don't have a recollection of whether they were killed within the same month or within the same year your evidence is not very helpful.</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> It was the same year but not the same day.  It could be the same month but definitely not the same day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Very well there is nothing we can do about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a>	Yes will you move on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> The third incident that you are asking for amnesty is Bonginkosi Khanyile. Can you tell us who</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a>Bonginkosi Khanyile was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I was told that Bonginkosi Khanyile was from Vuma area.  I did not know him.  He was accidentally killed.  We were from the conference at Ensingweni.</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Who was this Mr Kanyele, was he an ANC member at the ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No just, just don't put it like that. He says it was done by mistake. Let's just get some more details about where this was done, how it was done?</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a>	You said that you were coming from a meeting, where was this meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> The meeting was Ensingweni where our IFP president was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And what happened when you were coming from this meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> It was about 4 pm  when we came back.  We were in the bus and they through bottles at our bus.  I then pursued him and asked him why they threw bottles at our bus.  I then stabbed him with a knife.  Muhle Mthethwa then came there and shot him with pellets on his eye.  I am the one who stabbed him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just give me that name again, Muhle who?</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Muhle Mthethwa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Did you see Mr Kanyele at the shops?</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I saw him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> And with who was he or who was with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> They were four, sitting near the bottle store, drinking some beer.  The other three managed to run away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Did they first throw bottles at your vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> They threw bottles at a bus. They did not throw stones.  They had beer bottles.</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The bus they threw bottles and stones at a bus.</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> They threw them at a bus.</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> And where were the bottles thrown at or what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> (... no English translation)</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> What bus are we talking about now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> The bus was carrying IFP supporters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> And where were you at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I was there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Do you know why stones were thrown at the bus, bottles?</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes, I know why they were throwing bottles at our bus.</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Why is that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> It is because many IFP supporters were not in the area.  They had attended this conference we were coming from.  Because they are ANC members, they attack our bus.</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So because they didn't attend the rally you regarded them as ANC members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> He could not have sat there with ANC members if he was not a member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, but then there were four of them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I did not know them, but I knew one of them as a resident in the location.</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You don't even know them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> We did not think that they were ANC supporters.  We knew they were.  The only person we did not know was the deceased because he was sitting with them, we thought he was also one of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And because they didn't attend the rally you took it for granted that they were all ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> They were wearing ANC T-shirts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Apart from them being with ANC members and not attending the rally, is there anything else that gave you the impression that he was an ANC member?</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> They were wearing ANC T-shirts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> On that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> And who started throwing the bottles?</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Khanyile started throwing stones.</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> And did you people get off the bus?</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Did you get off while the bottles were being thrown or only afterwards?</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> We got off at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> May we hear the interpreters?</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What did he say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Yes and what did you do when you got off the bus?</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> We got off, I grabbed him and stabbed him.  Muhle then came there and shot him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> When you got off the bus and stabbed him what was Mr Khanyile doing at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> He was running away but one could see he still wanted to come back and fulfil what he wanted to do.  I then stabbed him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> So do I understand you correctly there was no planning done before this incident, it happened on the spur of the moment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> And what is the reason for killing or stabbing Mr Khanyile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> The reason why I stabbed him is because he was throwing stones at our bus.  I then pursued them when they were running away and I managed to catch him and then stabbed him on his shoulder with a knife.  He tried to run away again ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Were you with this other person who eventually shot Mr Khanyile at the time when he was shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Many people followed me when I got off the bus, but the person who shot him was Muhle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> You also mentioned in a statement ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Just before you proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a>	Did you leave the body of Mr Khanyile there?  Did any of the other members go to the body?</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> There were KwaZulu Police on that day.  Mr Khanyile's body was then taken to the mortuary by the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did this attack on Khanyile happen in the presence of the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Were you arrested there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Nobody was arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did the police just allow you to leave?</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes, that is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And you say they saw the killing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes, they did see when he was shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> When you started to give evidence on this incident you referred to the four people sitting on the stoep or sitting at the shops with their case of beer drinking beer and you said you did not know any of them. You also then already said it was a mistake, but when you were questioned you said you knew three of them.  Do you have the names of the other three for us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I know the first person as Peter Dludla.  The other one is Dube, I do not know his first name.  He was a special constable in the Police Service.</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And the third one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> The third one was Mvana Biyela.</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did you know them to be ANC members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Even the man who was a special constable, Dube?</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes, he is a special constable in the police service.</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I thought that special constables were taken and picked on amongst the Inkatha supporters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> It is true that the special constables were IFP supporters.  Dube joined before this happened.  After he was appointed as such, he then showed his true colours that he was an ANC supporter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Was he on duty that afternoon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> He was sitting at his house.  He was from Ulundi, I think.</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did he wear a uniform?</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> No, he was not wearing a uniform.</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> I see in your initial application you give the name of Ngoso Dludla and Bonginkosi Khanyile as being the same person, is that correct? Is that the same person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> You mean Dludla.</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where are you reading from, just read it please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Page 2 of your application form.</p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes what does it say there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> At number 4, third person Ngoso Dludla also known as Bonginkosi Khanyile.</p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a>	Is that the same person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Let him have a look at that application form please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Mr Dludla is someone else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Why I am asking the question is, in your statement that was added to your application for amnesty you also make mention of an incident where Ngoso Dludla was killed while you were out of town.</p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I have not mentioned Ngoso Dludla yet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> That application form that you have before you is that your handwriting, did you fill that in or who did it for you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> This is not my handwriting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Whose handwriting is it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> It is the handwriting of the policeman who came to take statements.</p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And all the information was given to him by you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes, I can read.  He wrote what was said by me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well now if you look at that page on page 2 where the names are written - just let him have it again please, did you give him the first name, Vusi Muzi Mundungazi Gaziboni Mbokazi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I do not know this name Vusimuzi Mbokazi.  There are people who were shot in the house that I did not know.  I was told these names by the policeman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now then in the second line it also said also known as Botha do you see that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I cannot dispute that Botha is also Vusimuzi Mbokazi because I did not know his real names.</p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now what is the second name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> (... no English translation)</p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is his name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> (...no English translation)</p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Read the third name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes I can read, that third name is his.  His name is Ngoso Dludla.  I cannot dispute that his other name is Bonginkosi Khanyile.  I only know him as Ngoso Dludla.</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It says Ngoso?</p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I cannot dispute that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Also known as Bonginkosi Khanyile.</p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I do not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So in respect of all these incidents in which you took part in killing you were not arrested nor were you charged?</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes, that is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I know what caused all that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I would like to know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> The reason why we were never arrested is because many police officers in Eshowe police station were IFP members.  They were also providing us with information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, do complete your questioning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Okay the person you know as Khanyile and Ngoso Dludla is that the same person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I will admit that that is the same person because that is how it is written down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> What I am trying to find out, you gave us an explanation of how you stabbed one Bonginkosi Khanyile and he was later shot, is that the same person as Ngoso Dludla?</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> The person who was stabbed and shot was not Ngoso Dludla.  Dludla's story is still a long one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> You were not present when Ngoso Dludla was shot, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I was present when Ngoso Dludla was killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Was a decision taken to have ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Hold it, "I was present" where?  What happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> What was your question Mr Alberts, was he present where?</p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I was present when a decision was taken that he should be killed.  I was also present when he was killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Who else was present when the plan was made to kill him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Thandazani Linda, Mr Nyawuza, Muhle Mthethwa and myself were there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Who is Thandazani Linda?</p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Thandazani Linda came from eNseleni.  He was the guard in Mr Nyawuza's house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Muhle Mthethwa who was he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Muhle Mthethwa was an IFP member from Mandini.</p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Why was it decided that Mr Dludla had to be murdered?</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I cannot say why Mr Ngoso Dludla was killed because this was not done by my hand.  What I know is that Mr Nywwuza was not in good terms with Dludla because of the attack on his wife.  Mr Nyawuza's wife was shot in 1993 ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just give us the name of the person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I do not know Mr Dlulane's name.  His familiar name in the location is Nyawuza.</p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Is that the same person you have been referring to in your previous testimony?</p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Alright so now I am not fast, I didn't take down.  I want you to tell me now why do you think that Ngoso Dludla was killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> The reason why Ngoso Dludla was killed is because Mr Nyawuza's house was one day attacked, and his wife was shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> What is the name of the wife of Dlulane Nyawusa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Fakazile Gumede.</p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Was it suspected that Dludla had something to do with the killing of this lady?</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> He was suspected.  They in fact said he should be the first person to be killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> But you didn't know it, you just accepted the word of the other people at this meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> And what was then decided regarding Mr Dludla?</p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> It was decided that he should be fatally shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> How long was the plan to have him killed implemented?</p>
<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> It took a long time for Mr Ngoso Dludla to be killed because his parents had taken him away from the area and he was now attending school at Gqikazi in Nongoma area, where he was with Nyawuza's children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Just to come back regarding one aspect of this meeting, was it decided between the people at the meeting that he should be killed or was an order given?</p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is meant by: "an order given" when they are all agreeing among themselves that he should be killed? Who issues orders then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Mr Chairman I am just trying to establish was it decided between themselves or was it somebody who made the decision on their behalf.</p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> We, as supporters, were just told what we were supposed to do.  We would then follow that order.</p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> From who did you receive this instruction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Mr Nyawuza.</p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> When did this meeting take place, can you remember the date?</p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I think we decided about Dludla in 1992.</p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> And how long after this meeting was Mr Dludla in fact murdered?</p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> He was killed in Easter in 1993.</p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Can you tell us how it happened that he was killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> On that day, the Thursday, I was supposed to leave for Newcastle.  However, I did not leave because the ANC was going to hold a meeting in Nyanini.  I then saw Mr Dludla leaving the place he was staying and he went to a shebeen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Were you waiting for him at that time?  Did you know that he was going to pass by there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line546"><a name="pos546"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I was visiting at Khuzwayo's house when I saw him walking past.</p>
<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where was this ANC rally to be held?</p>
<p class="line" id="line548"><a name="pos548"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> It was going to in Nyanini.  It was not a rally, but a meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Oh I thought you said it was a rally, maybe it is the translation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Just to come back to my question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Hold it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a>	Dludla was on his way to an ANC meeting at Nyanini, and then what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> He went to a shebeen, and stayed there until late in the evening.  The people who were ordered to kill him namely Muhle Mthethwa from Mandini and Thandazani Linda were there.  When he came out, they then shot him.  They carried him after he died and put him in the passage near his house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just tell us who shot him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Muhle Mthethwa is the one who fired a shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Were you present when he was shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I was present and saw everything</p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> After the body was dumped what ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry did anybody else take part in the shooting besides Muhle Mthethwa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Nobody else shot him.  After that, Thandazani and Muhle carried him and dumped his body in the passage near his house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> After the body ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Please just hold it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a>	What passage are you talking about? You say the body was dumped next to the passage, what passage was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> This is a thoroughfare used by pedestrians in the location when they go to other sections in the location.</p>
<p class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> And after the body was dumped what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line566"><a name="pos566"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I heard them saying that some of his body parts should be removed because a certain invanga wanted them.  I did not want to be involved in removing some of his body parts because we had done what Mr Nyawuza had ordered us to, that is to kill him.  They removed some of his parts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Were you present when that happened, when the body was mutilated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line568"><a name="pos568"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I was not present when his body was mutilated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> And where did you go to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line570"><a name="pos570"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I went to Khuzwayo's house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Did you report this incident to anybody?</p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I did not tell anybody.</p>
<p class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Just to take you back to one aspect, did you know why the wife of Dludlani was killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> No, Mr Nyawuza's wife was not killed, she was shot and her hip was injured.</p>
<p class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Sorry but did you know why that was done, why it happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> His house was attacked because he was an IFP leader.</p>
<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He won't know, he just thinks so it doesn't take the matter very much further.   We will take the short adjournment at this stage and resume in 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Mr Chairman there are two incidents mentioned in a statement by the applicant that is attached to his application that happened before the cut-off date but it is not mentioned in his form 1, the application itself.  I don't know whether I will have permission to proceed in leading evidence in that regard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where are they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> It is on page 24 and 25, middle paragraph on page 24 and the first paragraph on page 25.</p>
<p class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr Alberts, are you referring to the Mahaye incident and the son of Nthuli?</p>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line585"><a name="pos585"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> This is in the form of an affidavit.  This statement is in fact an affidavit isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line586"><a name="pos586"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> That is correct, its heading says affidavit but it was however not deposed as an affidavit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well it does appear to be, page 27.</p>
<p class="line" id="line588"><a name="pos588"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> In fact Mr Chairman the typewritten document appears to be a transcript of the handwritten document which appears from page 8 to page 20 and it appears on page 20 that in fact the applicant affixed his thumb print and the Commissioner of Oaths certified it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line589"><a name="pos589"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And is it his desire to apply for amnesty in respect of these matters?</p>
<p class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr Alberts, may I also refer you to page 26 at the top there, the reference to two school boys, are you not including that as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line593"><a name="pos593"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> I apologise, yes that should also be included.</p>
<p class="line" id="line594"><a name="pos594"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You may proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Brink may not this be, may produce some difficulties in the sense that parties who may have an interest in this matter are not here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line596"><a name="pos596"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> That is absolutely correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line597"><a name="pos597"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And there is no way of finding out whether they may not have a view that might affect the facts that are set out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line598"><a name="pos598"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Indeed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line599"><a name="pos599"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In these paragraphs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line600"><a name="pos600"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Indeed. I think with great respect Mr Chairman, it would be inadvisable to proceed with this aspect of the application at this stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line601"><a name="pos601"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Unless we hear his evidence and then you take it upon yourself to obtain affidavits from the affected parties only to the extent that they may have a view of the fact that are different and then you obtain those affidavits to place their version of the facts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line602"><a name="pos602"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Yes, that could be done.</p>
<p class="line" id="line603"><a name="pos603"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And we may postpone taking a decision on the matter and you and Mr Alberts can go through those facts to find out whether there is any difficulty between the two of you, otherwise it might mean postponing this application and then sitting again on another day when the three of us may not be sitting together for a long time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line604"><a name="pos604"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Yes, I see the problem.</p>
<p class="line" id="line605"><a name="pos605"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What do you say to that?  Yes I think that it is only proper that we will not make a decision on this matter until the dependants and the relatives have had an opportunity to express their views concerning them, concerning the matters that affect them.  In the meanwhile we will allow and we will accept his application in respect of these matters so you may start, you may proceed with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line606"><a name="pos606"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line607"><a name="pos607"></a>	You also made mention in your affidavit of an attack of the Msomi kraal.  Was there a meeting held to decide on this aspect?</p>
<p class="line" id="line608"><a name="pos608"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> We were still talking about Ngoso.</p>
<p class="line" id="line609"><a name="pos609"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Mr Chairman. I don't know if anybody else has something further about Ngoso or the previous incident that we dealt with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line610"><a name="pos610"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well for the time being we haven't but we may ask him questions if the need arises.</p>
<p class="line" id="line611"><a name="pos611"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line612"><a name="pos612"></a>	Okay we moving onto the attack on the kraal of Msomi now, was a meeting held?</p>
<p class="line" id="line613"><a name="pos613"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, start off with, instead of whether a meeting was held, start off with what was done, what did these people do before you talk to him about what the meeting was about isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line614"><a name="pos614"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line615"><a name="pos615"></a>	Do you know why the kraal of Msomi was attacked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line616"><a name="pos616"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line617"><a name="pos617"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> What was the reason?</p>
<p class="line" id="line618"><a name="pos618"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> The reason why Msomi's kraal was attacked is because another boy, namely Mbeshe Mahaye was killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line619"><a name="pos619"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Do you know by whom he was killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line620"><a name="pos620"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I do not know why Mbeshe was killed, I only received a message that he was killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line621"><a name="pos621"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Did you suspect anybody?</p>
<p class="line" id="line622"><a name="pos622"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well they just received a message that he had been killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line623"><a name="pos623"></a> Did you know this man Mahaye?</p>
<p class="line" id="line624"><a name="pos624"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes, I knew him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line625"><a name="pos625"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When was he killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line626"><a name="pos626"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> It was in 1993/94, as far as I can remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line627"><a name="pos627"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where was this man from, Mr Mahaye?</p>
<p class="line" id="line628"><a name="pos628"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Mahye was from Mkhukhuze, in Nyanini.  It is in Exhowe area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line629"><a name="pos629"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You received a message that he had been killed, what happened after that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line630"><a name="pos630"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> We came together, we IFP boys.  A KwaZulu policeman was also present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line631"><a name="pos631"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just give me the names of the people who gathered?</p>
<p class="line" id="line632"><a name="pos632"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> The KwaZulu policeman was Ngema, I have forgotten his first name.  Another person was Thokozani Ntuli.  He was not a KwaZulu police but an IFP member.  Mbeshe Mahaye's brothers, namely Mso and Kusakusa were also present.  Kusakusa is still a KwaZulu policeman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line633"><a name="pos633"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How do you spell that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line634"><a name="pos634"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> K U S A K U S A.</p>
<p class="line" id="line635"><a name="pos635"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> B-U-S-A?  Yes do carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line636"><a name="pos636"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I do not know the other people because there was many.  Thulani Myeza, Thokozani Ntuli, Kusakusa Mahaye and myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line637"><a name="pos637"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> There was yourself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line638"><a name="pos638"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line639"><a name="pos639"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes. Where did you gather?</p>
<p class="line" id="line640"><a name="pos640"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> We met in the scrap yard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line641"><a name="pos641"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> What was decided at this meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line642"><a name="pos642"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> We decided that we must destroy these boys houses because they had killed another boy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line643"><a name="pos643"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Why was the kraal of Mr Msomi chosen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line644"><a name="pos644"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> The message we received ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line645"><a name="pos645"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> What was the message?</p>
<p class="line" id="line646"><a name="pos646"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> The message was that the people who killed Mbeshe were staying at Msomi's place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line647"><a name="pos647"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Yes but what does that have to do with Mr Msomi, why was he chosen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line648"><a name="pos648"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> The reason why Msomi's house should be attacked is because the boys who murdered Mbeshe stayed there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line649"><a name="pos649"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> And how did you know the identity of the attackers or that they were there at Msomi's place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line650"><a name="pos650"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> That is the message we got, that these boys were at Msomi's kraal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line651"><a name="pos651"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> And what was decided at this meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line652"><a name="pos652"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> We decided to go and destroy Msomi's house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line653"><a name="pos653"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Was that a decision taking by everybody together or was it one person that made the decision?</p>
<p class="line" id="line654"><a name="pos654"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> This was a decision from all of us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line655"><a name="pos655"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Did you immediately after this meeting proceed to the kraal of Mr Msomi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line656"><a name="pos656"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> We first sent the KwaZulu police to this house, so that these people would think the police were the ones who were coming there.  We then followed the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line657"><a name="pos657"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Was that on the Sunday?</p>
<p class="line" id="line658"><a name="pos658"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line659"><a name="pos659"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Okay you now follow the KwaZulu Police to the kraal, what happened at the kraal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line660"><a name="pos660"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> We went in and destroyed the whole kraal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line661"><a name="pos661"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> How many people were you at that time when you attacked the kraal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line662"><a name="pos662"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> We were more then twenty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line663"><a name="pos663"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Were you armed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line664"><a name="pos664"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes, we were armed.  I had a firearm and other people had homemade firearms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line665"><a name="pos665"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> If you say you destroyed the kraal, what did you do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line666"><a name="pos666"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> When we arrived there, we dosed the kraal with petrol that we had, and we set it alight.</p>
<p class="line" id="line667"><a name="pos667"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Did anybody die on that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line668"><a name="pos668"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> The police did tell me that some of the people were killed there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line669"><a name="pos669"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Do you know how these people died?</p>
<p class="line" id="line670"><a name="pos670"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> They were burnt in the house.  There was also a girl from Durban who was visiting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line671"><a name="pos671"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> How did they die?</p>
<p class="line" id="line672"><a name="pos672"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Before the kraal was set alight, a shot was fired while we were outside there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line673"><a name="pos673"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Apart from the burning of the huts, were shots fired, was anybody physically assaulted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line674"><a name="pos674"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> ...[no English translation]</p>
<p class="line" id="line675"><a name="pos675"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> And after these houses were set alight what did you do then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line676"><a name="pos676"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> We then left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line677"><a name="pos677"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Yes where did you go to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line678"><a name="pos678"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> We went to other kraals in that Nyanini area.  We did the same to those kraals, and we thereafter left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line679"><a name="pos679"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Do you know who the other people are whose kraals were attacked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line680"><a name="pos680"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I do not know the owners of that other kraals in Nyanini.</p>
<p class="line" id="line681"><a name="pos681"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Apart from the Msomi household, can you give us any other names of people whose kraals were attacked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line682"><a name="pos682"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Mr Chairman, I am sorry to interrupt but this aspect of the matter is not covered by the affidavit.  I don't think it with respect be included in this application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line683"><a name="pos683"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is this talking about the Msomi house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line684"><a name="pos684"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line685"><a name="pos685"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Alright now before you attacked the Msomi house did you satisfy yourself that there were people living in the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line686"><a name="pos686"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> We did not ascertain whether there were any people in the house, we just attacked without knocking.</p>
<p class="line" id="line687"><a name="pos687"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What time of the day was this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line688"><a name="pos688"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> It was during the night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line689"><a name="pos689"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But were you expecting people to be there in the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line690"><a name="pos690"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> We knew there were people living in those kraals.</p>
<p class="line" id="line691"><a name="pos691"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What did the police do that went ahead of you, what did the police do at this place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line692"><a name="pos692"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> The police did not enter Msomi's kraal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line693"><a name="pos693"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What did they do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line694"><a name="pos694"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> They walked past and went to wait at Mbeshe Mahaye's kraal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line695"><a name="pos695"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where who had been stabbed, Mbeshe Mahaye?</p>
<p class="line" id="line696"><a name="pos696"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line697"><a name="pos697"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, do carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line698"><a name="pos698"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Can you remember the date of this attack on the kraal of Msomi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line699"><a name="pos699"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I think it was in 1994/95.</p>
<p class="line" id="line700"><a name="pos700"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> I see in your statement you state it was in 1994 before the elections, is that more or less correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line701"><a name="pos701"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line702"><a name="pos702"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Sorry Mr Alberts this is rather crucial, it's not a question of more or less correct.  If it is after the elections then there is no application, so could you try and establish whether he has any recollection as to the relative date relating to the elections?</p>
<p class="line" id="line703"><a name="pos703"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Have you got any idea, do you know if it was before the election or after the election?</p>
<p class="line" id="line704"><a name="pos704"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I cannot remember because this happened long ago, I think it was in 1994, before the election.</p>
<p class="line" id="line705"><a name="pos705"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> You gave us two times, initially you said 1993/1994 or 1993 beginning of 1994 and now later you say 1994/1995, which is now correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line706"><a name="pos706"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I think it was before the election.</p>
<p class="line" id="line707"><a name="pos707"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, do carry on.</p>

<p class="line" id="line714"><a name="pos714"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> And after the attacks on these houses, did you all go back, where did you go to then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line715"><a name="pos715"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Sorry Mr Alberts, the answer was that he was killed simply because he was a member of the IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line716"><a name="pos716"></a>	Was he a youth leader in the IFP? </p>
<p class="line" id="line717"><a name="pos717"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> He was the leader of the youth.</p>

<p class="line" id="line724"><a name="pos724"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> When you were asked in the beginning whether you know Mbeshe Mahaye your response as it came over through the interpretation service was: "I know him very well."</p>
<p class="line" id="line725"><a name="pos725"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line726"><a name="pos726"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Was he ever part of your group that went attacking ANC's?</p>

<p class="line" id="line733"><a name="pos733"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Did he have any position in the ANC, any specific reason why?</p>

<p class="line" id="line736"><a name="pos736"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> The person who decided that he should be killed is Nyawuza.</p>

<p class="line" id="line746"><a name="pos746"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> What reason did he give?</p>
<p class="line" id="line747"><a name="pos747"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Mr Nyawuza and him once argued to the extent they drew firearms and wanted to shoot each other.</p>

<p class="line" id="line755"><a name="pos755"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> The person who ordered that Mgodini's son should be killed is Mr Nyawuza because he is the one who had an argument with him.</p>

<p class="line" id="line830"><a name="pos830"></a>	Did you fire any shots?</p>
<p class="line" id="line831"><a name="pos831"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> We did not shoot further because nobody came out of the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line832"><a name="pos832"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> When Dlamini got into the Hippo, where did you go to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line833"><a name="pos833"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> We went back to Nyawuza's house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line834"><a name="pos834"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Did you report this to anybody?</p>
<p class="line" id="line835"><a name="pos835"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> We reported to Mr Nyawuza Dlulane.</p>
<p class="line" id="line836"><a name="pos836"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> You also mentioned in your statement the matter where two school boys were killed by Sibonga Dlamini.</p>
<p class="line" id="line837"><a name="pos837"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> This is now page 26?</p>
<p class="line" id="line838"><a name="pos838"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line839"><a name="pos839"></a>	Do you know why these two school boys were shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line840"><a name="pos840"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How many school boys?</p>
<p class="line" id="line841"><a name="pos841"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Two school boys.</p>
<p class="line" id="line842"><a name="pos842"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Who killed them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line843"><a name="pos843"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> I am referring to two school boys according to your statement who was killed by Sibonga Dlamini.</p>
<p class="line" id="line844"><a name="pos844"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> That is another story.</p>
<p class="line" id="line845"><a name="pos845"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you know anything?</p>
<p class="line" id="line846"><a name="pos846"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes, I was not there, but I was present when the decision was taken that they should be killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line847"><a name="pos847"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I don't think that he was involved in the matter if you read that paragraph was he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line848"><a name="pos848"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> ... (no English translation)</p>
<p class="line" id="line849"><a name="pos849"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Do you know why ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line850"><a name="pos850"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You didn't take part in the killing? Because he wasn't even there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line851"><a name="pos851"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I did not kill anybody there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line852"><a name="pos852"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He committed no offence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line853"><a name="pos853"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> I will then move on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line854"><a name="pos854"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That is it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line855"><a name="pos855"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> It seems from your evidence that there were a lot of shootings between the two parties, what would you describe the condition in the area between the parties at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line856"><a name="pos856"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> There was a no good relationship between the IFP and ANC in the Eshowe area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line857"><a name="pos857"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Can you give us an idea why all this fighting took place, what was the reason for the fighting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line858"><a name="pos858"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> What caused the friction in Eshowe is the affiliation to the two parties.  The ANC started this by conducting meetings in the location and ordering everybody to become an ANC member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line859"><a name="pos859"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> What did you try to achieve by these killings that you were involved in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line860"><a name="pos860"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> We were doing this as we were also trained as SPU's, because we were getting money.  We were given money, but later this stopped.  Mr Nyawuza would bring the firearms and tell that we were supposed to kill co many.</p>
<p class="line" id="line861"><a name="pos861"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> How did you think at the time your actions would help the IFP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line862"><a name="pos862"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I was told that if the ANC still had leaders my party would not prosper.</p>
<p class="line" id="line863"><a name="pos863"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> And did you attack these opposition party members then to get them out of the area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line864"><a name="pos864"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line865"><a name="pos865"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> You mentioned being trained as an SPU member, when did this training take place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line866"><a name="pos866"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> The training took place in 1993, before election.</p>
<p class="line" id="line867"><a name="pos867"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> By whom were you trained?</p>
<p class="line" id="line868"><a name="pos868"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> We were trained at eMandleni.</p>
<p class="line" id="line869"><a name="pos869"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> And how would you consider or describe your role in this whole conflict, what would you say your role was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line870"><a name="pos870"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> The role I played in all this is that I was being called to go and kill people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line871"><a name="pos871"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So a killer is called a facilitator?</p>
<p class="line" id="line872"><a name="pos872"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Wouldn't a better word be something like a hit-man?</p>
<p class="line" id="line873"><a name="pos873"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well he was a facilitator. That is what he means.</p>
<p class="line" id="line874"><a name="pos874"></a>	If one kills somebody the killer is a facilitator, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line875"><a name="pos875"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> (Explanation)</p>
<p class="line" id="line876"><a name="pos876"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line877"><a name="pos877"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> And how do you feel about all these people that died by your hand or with your cooperation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line878"><a name="pos878"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I am not boasting, I feel very sorry about what happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line879"><a name="pos879"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> And is there something you want to say to the family of the victims of these actions of yours?</p>
<p class="line" id="line880"><a name="pos880"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes.  To the families of the people I killed, I ask them to forgive me.  I did not intend doing this.  It happened when violence was still very rife in Eshowe area.  I was also used to commit these murders because those people who were sending me to do this provided me with everything like firearms, etc.  I was doing this for the location of Gezinsila.  Today, My Nyawuza is happily living in the area now.  Many families lost their breadwinners because those breadwinners did not see eye to eye with Mr Nyawuza.  I ask those people to forgive me, not because I want to be freed from gaol.  It is not for me to say what they should do, but just to say that I am guilty.  I am really sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line881"><a name="pos881"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line882"><a name="pos882"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> That is all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line883"><a name="pos883"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> The matter for which you are apparently serving a sentence is not one of the matters you did apply for amnesty for, you know that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line884"><a name="pos884"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes, I did ask for amnesty for these two cases I am serving sentences for.</p>
<p class="line" id="line885"><a name="pos885"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> You however realise that those matters fall after the cut-off date of amnesty and that you are not going to get amnesty on those.</p>
<p class="line" id="line886"><a name="pos886"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I applied before closing date.</p>
<p class="line" id="line887"><a name="pos887"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Just one last aspect, what made you become what you call a facilitator, what made you go to this Dludlani and say to him: "Let me help you"?  What prompted you to do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line888"><a name="pos888"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> The reason why I realised that I was being used, is because the promises made to me were now not being fulfilled.</p>
<p class="line" id="line889"><a name="pos889"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman nothing from my side.</p>
<p class="line" id="line890"><a name="pos890"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR ALBERTS</p>
<p class="line" id="line891"><a name="pos891"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who made these promises to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line892"><a name="pos892"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Mr Dlulane.</p>
<p class="line" id="line893"><a name="pos893"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What were these promises?</p>
<p class="line" id="line894"><a name="pos894"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> He promised me that I would be employed as a member of the KwaZulu police because people who were doing as I was doing were the ones that were sought.</p>
<p class="line" id="line895"><a name="pos895"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What sort of work have you been doing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line896"><a name="pos896"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I never worked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line897"><a name="pos897"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And Mr Nyawuza what work does he do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line898"><a name="pos898"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Mr Nyawuza is working, he is a driver of uMntwana Gideon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line899"><a name="pos899"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Oh yes sorry, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line900"><a name="pos900"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Nothing further from my side.</p>
<p class="line" id="line901"><a name="pos901"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Brink any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line902"><a name="pos902"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR BRINK:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman. I just want to deal firstly with the murder of Mr Ntuli's son.  Did you in your evidence say that that took place in 1995?</p>
<p class="line" id="line903"><a name="pos903"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes, I remember it happened in 1995, I had just been released from prison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line904"><a name="pos904"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> When were you released from prison?</p>
<p class="line" id="line905"><a name="pos905"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I was released on 2 July 1994, it was a Tuesday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line906"><a name="pos906"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> So the murder of Ntuli's son took place after that date in July 1994, is that what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line907"><a name="pos907"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> It was long after I was released from prison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line908"><a name="pos908"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> But certainly after July 1994?</p>
<p class="line" id="line909"><a name="pos909"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes he said that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line910"><a name="pos910"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Ja.</p>
<p class="line" id="line911"><a name="pos911"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line912"><a name="pos912"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Now I want to deal with Mr Zikhali.  In your evidence I think you said that you saw Mr Zikhali waiting at the bus stop or the rank waiting for transport, you approached him, he was shot and you then left but that the shooting was done by Vusi Myeza?</p>
<p class="line" id="line913"><a name="pos913"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes, that is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line914"><a name="pos914"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Now when you made your affidavit, that is the supplementary affidavit to your application on the prescribed form - I refer to page 24 Mr Chairman, this is what you said regarding Mr Zikhali</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line915"><a name="pos915"></a>"Concerning the killing of Mr Zikhali who is an ANC member, the instruction came from Mr Dlulane also known as Nyawusa to go and kill Zikhali in Gensinsile location where he had visited his girlfriend at a cottage"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line916"><a name="pos916"></a>Do you remember saying that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line917"><a name="pos917"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line918"><a name="pos918"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> You went on</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line919"><a name="pos919"></a>"I and Mr Dludlani who was the driver to Gideon Zulu conveyed Sbu Zuma and Vusi Myeza to near the Bonamuva School where Fana Ntuli's cottages are situated."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line920"><a name="pos920"></a>Do you remember saying that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line921"><a name="pos921"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line922"><a name="pos922"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> What you said was</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line923"><a name="pos923"></a>"I and Mr Dludlani who was the driver to Gideon Zulu conveyed Sbu Zuma and Vusi Myeza to near the Bonamuva School where Fana Ntuli's cottages are situated."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line924"><a name="pos924"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Will you repeat what you said about Fana Ntuli?</p>
<p class="line" id="line925"><a name="pos925"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line926"><a name="pos926"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> You then went on</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line927"><a name="pos927"></a>"Vusi Myeza was armed with a .38 special revolver and Sbu Zuma had a 9mm pistol."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line928"><a name="pos928"></a>Did you say that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line929"><a name="pos929"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes, that is what I said to the detectives, but I did not put it that way here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line930"><a name="pos930"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> I am talking about the affidavit which is put up in support of your application for amnesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line931"><a name="pos931"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Let him have a look at it if he has a doubt Mr Brink, please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line932"><a name="pos932"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Sorry I thought he had one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line933"><a name="pos933"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No his handwriting, is that in his handwriting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line934"><a name="pos934"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> I very much doubt it because he puts his thumb print to the affidavit.  So ...(indistinct) is illiterate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line935"><a name="pos935"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ask him if he can read.</p>
<p class="line" id="line936"><a name="pos936"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Are you able to read English?</p>
<p class="line" id="line937"><a name="pos937"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I will be able to read it if it is written in Zulu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line938"><a name="pos938"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Alright well let me take it slowly. I will read to you what is here and it will be interpreted into Zulu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line939"><a name="pos939"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You don't have to read what you have already read.</p>
<p class="line" id="line940"><a name="pos940"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> No.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line941"><a name="pos941"></a>"After thirty minutes we fetched them at the scrap yard near Nkanyezi Magistrate's Court as arranged."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line942"><a name="pos942"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line943"><a name="pos943"></a>MR BRINK</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line944"><a name="pos944"></a>"Before we could fetch them they telephoned to say that they had killed him.  Sbu Zuma killed him."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line945"><a name="pos945"></a>What do you say to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line946"><a name="pos946"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> No, I did not put it that way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line947"><a name="pos947"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Was this document read back to you or not? I will leave it Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line948"><a name="pos948"></a>	Now I am going to deal briefly with Mr Ngoso Dludla.  I think you said in your evidence that after he was killed there was some attempt at mutilation of his body. </p>
<p class="line" id="line949"><a name="pos949"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line950"><a name="pos950"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Well you see the postmortem report seems to indicate - I am referring to page 41 Mr Chair and members of the Committee., indicates that in regard to the body of Bonginkosi Khanyile who you in your application on more than one occasion referred to as being the same person as Ngoso Dludla, it was the body of Mr Khanyile which appeared to be mutilated, that half his face was moved as a result of having been cut away by a sharp blade and something was pushed, I can't read, something was pushed through the left eye.  Now what do you say to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line951"><a name="pos951"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> That is a mistake.</p>
<p class="line" id="line952"><a name="pos952"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> But this relates to the body of Mr Khanyile, is that not the same person as Mr Ngoso Dludla?</p>
<p class="line" id="line953"><a name="pos953"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I will agree with how you put it, but I know him as Ngoso Dludla.</p>
<p class="line" id="line954"><a name="pos954"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Alright so we can accept that Mr Ngoso Dludla is the same person as Mr Khanyile.</p>
<p class="line" id="line955"><a name="pos955"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> That is possible, I cannot dispute it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line956"><a name="pos956"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Mr Chairman I am now referring to page 25 of the affidavit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line957"><a name="pos957"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr Brink, just before you proceed, is it not possible that there is a mistaken identity of the individual that was killed at the occasion where the beer bottles were thrown at the bus?</p>
<p class="line" id="line958"><a name="pos958"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Yes, one can't exclude that possibility.</p>
<p class="line" id="line959"><a name="pos959"></a>	But in any event you say that you were present when Mr Ngoso Dludla - please leave your microphone until I finish the question, when I finish the question and it has been interpreted to you then you can put your microphone on because every time you press your button it cuts me off. Going back to Mr Dludla. You say you were present when he was killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line960"><a name="pos960"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes, I was present when Ngoso Dludla was killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line961"><a name="pos961"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> You see again in your affidavit, that is the affidavit in support of your application for amnesty, you indicated that</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line962"><a name="pos962"></a>"I left on a Thursday afternoon for Newcastle before our plot, the plot to kill Mr Dludla was carried out.  On my return on Sunday I was informed by those who were present that Ngoso Dludla was shot dead by Togozani Ntuli, Thandazani Linda and Pazman."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line963"><a name="pos963"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where are you reading from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line964"><a name="pos964"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Page 25, middle paragraph.</p>
<p class="line" id="line965"><a name="pos965"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> No, the person who took down the statement made a mistake.</p>
<p class="line" id="line966"><a name="pos966"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Was the statement read back to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line967"><a name="pos967"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line968"><a name="pos968"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Who do you say killed Dludla?</p>
<p class="line" id="line969"><a name="pos969"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> The person who shot Ngoso Dludla is Muhle Mthethwa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line970"><a name="pos970"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Now finally, had you not been offered some sort of promise of employment by Mr Nyawuza, would you have embarked upon these various acts of murder or been party to them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line971"><a name="pos971"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> There would be no other reason for me to kill people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line972"><a name="pos972"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> No, no I am not asking about instructions. My question was in the light of your evidence that Nyahusa had promised you should you require it, employment, would you have carried out these killings had he not made such an offer to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line973"><a name="pos973"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I would not have killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line974"><a name="pos974"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> So was your motivation in carrying out these killings and being party to them, your motivation's one of a possible gain by permanent employment which you haven't had before that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line975"><a name="pos975"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes, that is what I say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line976"><a name="pos976"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line977"><a name="pos977"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR BRINK</p>
<p class="line" id="line978"><a name="pos978"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> May I just follow up on that. I want to be as fair as possible to you Mr Myeza.  For one I am not sure that you really fully understand the process and why you are here.  You can only get amnesty if you tell the truth.  You can only get amnesty for crimes that you committed.  This is not a court that will find you guilty or not guilty, we have to find out whether we are satisfied that you are telling us everything that happened, inclusive of all your guilt, all your participation.  Now frankly the difficulty is that we have different versions in your amnesty application, in your additional statement that you say you gave to the investigators and in your evidence today and you are simply saying to us that it wasn't your handwriting, you didn't say it, it wasn't read back to you but my question is, and I am coming back to the issue of Mr Dludla's death, you say expressly to whoever took this statement</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line979"><a name="pos979"></a>"I left on the Thursday afternoon for Newcastle before our plot was carried out. On my return on a Sunday I was informed that Dludla was shot dead."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line980"><a name="pos980"></a>Now where would the investigator get this information from if you did not tell him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line981"><a name="pos981"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> He is not telling the truth.  I did not say that to the person who was taking my statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line982"><a name="pos982"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Let me ask you just a very simple question, are you satisfied, because it is in your own interest, that you have told us everything and that you have been truthful because we have to make that finding before we can seriously consider granting you amnesty.  Are you satisfied that you have been open, truthful and told us everything?  Is there anything more you want to tell us or to set the record straight on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line983"><a name="pos983"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> About Ngoso Dludla, and this is what I told the people who were taking down my statement, is that many people knew that I would be going to Newcastle.  I did not go because he was killed on Thursday night before Good Friday.  I do not make a mistake about what I said in my statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line984"><a name="pos984"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Let's talk about Mr Nyawuza.  He is the gentleman who is the driver of Mr Zulu.  When did Mr Nyawuza make this promise to you that you would get employment in the KZN Police, what year?  You might not remember the date, you might not remember the month but when was this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line985"><a name="pos985"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I remember that it was in 1993.</p>
<p class="line" id="line986"><a name="pos986"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where were you when he made this statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line987"><a name="pos987"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> We first went for training.  It was in C section in Ulandi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line988"><a name="pos988"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you alone when he made this promise to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line989"><a name="pos989"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I was with Xolani Ngema.</p>
<p class="line" id="line990"><a name="pos990"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What were you expected to do in return?</p>
<p class="line" id="line991"><a name="pos991"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> He said before we became permanent force members, Inkatha should first win the election in KwaZulu Natal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line992"><a name="pos992"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, my question is what were you expected to do in return for this promise?</p>
<p class="line" id="line993"><a name="pos993"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I was expected to kill ANC members, the people who were a trouble and were not in good relationship with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line994"><a name="pos994"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Have I understood you to say that had he not made this promise to you, you would not have done what you have done?</p>
<p class="line" id="line995"><a name="pos995"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> No, we could not have killed people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line996"><a name="pos996"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you receive any gifts or presents from him for doing things for him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line997"><a name="pos997"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> There is nothing else except the government firearms that were given to us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line998"><a name="pos998"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And who was supporting and maintaining you in the meanwhile, giving you food and clothing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line999"><a name="pos999"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Mr Dlulane used to bring food and clothing for us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1000"><a name="pos1000"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Throughout the period 1993/1994?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1001"><a name="pos1001"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1002"><a name="pos1002"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> As far as money was concerned, did you receive any money from him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1003"><a name="pos1003"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> He was not giving us money.  We were getting money from Ulundi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1004"><a name="pos1004"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You used to fetch money from who?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1005"><a name="pos1005"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> We were being paid as SPU members.  We received it from a certain person in Ulundi who was in charge of finances there.  I cannot recall his name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1006"><a name="pos1006"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was that every month or every week, how often was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1007"><a name="pos1007"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> After every two months.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1008"><a name="pos1008"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is SPU, what does it mean?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1009"><a name="pos1009"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> (Explanation of Self Protection Unit)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1010"><a name="pos1010"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1011"><a name="pos1011"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So this was full time as far as you are concerned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1012"><a name="pos1012"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1013"><a name="pos1013"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And as member of the SPU who did you take orders from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1014"><a name="pos1014"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> We got some orders from Phillip Powell when we were still in training.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1015"><a name="pos1015"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Would he come there to where you were and give instructions or were these instructions conveyed to you in some other way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1016"><a name="pos1016"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> At Umfolozi where we received training, we had commanders who were working under him.  We had commanders like "Somatekisi" and others that I cannot recall their surnames.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1017"><a name="pos1017"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But that was only during the time that you have for training but you were only for training for a short period?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1018"><a name="pos1018"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes, ...[indistinct] six months.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1019"><a name="pos1019"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> After the training was over who did you get instructions from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1020"><a name="pos1020"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> The person who organised training for us was Mr Nyawuza.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1021"><a name="pos1021"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Can you just tell us this Mr Philip Powell, have you met him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1022"><a name="pos1022"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1023"><a name="pos1023"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Where did you meet him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1024"><a name="pos1024"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> At Umfolozi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1025"><a name="pos1025"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did you see him daily?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1026"><a name="pos1026"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> He came once in a fortnight for six months.  He is the one who also brought us the certificates to show that we had passed our training.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1027"><a name="pos1027"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> What was that training called, what were you told what were you being trained for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1028"><a name="pos1028"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> We were trained to protect the IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1029"><a name="pos1029"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Now just a question as to the structure of the SPU, after your training did you have to report to anyone?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1030"><a name="pos1030"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> We, as the region of Eshowe were reporting to Nyawuza after performing our duties, another person was Sipho Mbambo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1031"><a name="pos1031"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did you have meetings of the SPU in Eshowe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1032"><a name="pos1032"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> There were no meetings that were held at Eshowe.  We held our meetings in Empangeni, where all the SPU's would come together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1033"><a name="pos1033"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did you then have regular meetings there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1034"><a name="pos1034"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> We used to have meetings there were some of us would be picked to join the army at Mtubatuba.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1035"><a name="pos1035"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Who was the head of the unit in that region, was it Nwyawza or was it Mr Mbambo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1036"><a name="pos1036"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> The person who was very helpful and we regarded as our commander was Mr Mbambo, Sipho Mbambo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1037"><a name="pos1037"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Was Mr Nyawuza also an SPU?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1038"><a name="pos1038"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> No he was just a driver and the bodyguard of uMntwana Gideon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1039"><a name="pos1039"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Why did you have to report on SPU matters to Nuyawuza?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1040"><a name="pos1040"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> The reason why we reported to him is because he is the one who facilitated that we had a contact with this white man who was in charge of the SPU's</p>
<p class="line" id="line1041"><a name="pos1041"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1042"><a name="pos1042"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Mr Myeza before you were trained were you an IFP member in the in the district of Eshowe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1043"><a name="pos1043"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I was a card-carrying member of the IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1044"><a name="pos1044"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Did you believe in the IFP policies because I understand you to say to us that the card was taken out on your behalf, am I right in so understanding you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1045"><a name="pos1045"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I believed in the policies of the IFP because my family was also IFP members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1046"><a name="pos1046"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Had there not been promises of a police job, would you have gone for the training?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1047"><a name="pos1047"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I would not have gone for training.  It would mean that I was not going to get a job after training.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1048"><a name="pos1048"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> But you realise that after the training you were instead a facilitator in perpetrating crimes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1049"><a name="pos1049"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes, that is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1050"><a name="pos1050"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Did you ask at some stage before perpetrating these crimes: "When am I getting the job I have been trained for"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1051"><a name="pos1051"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I thought the job we were doing was the reason why we had been trained because we would go to Ulundi and get paid for what we did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1052"><a name="pos1052"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> You say you earned a salary for some time but it stopped, didn't your mind question if is this a permanent job or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1053"><a name="pos1053"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I did not think of that because the reason why we could not get our money then, is because the person who was paying us was no longer at Ulundi.  He had run away.  When we went to Ulundi to protest about not getting our money, we found that this person had run away and there was a new person in his place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1054"><a name="pos1054"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Now the people who trained you could you describe them to us who are they?  We know that Philip Powell would from time to time show his face a day or after but did you know who trained you people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1055"><a name="pos1055"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> The person who was training us at Umfolozi was Somatekisi Mthembu.  That is how he was known.  There were many other commanders, but I did not know their names, another one was Madlinyoka.  What was happening there is that people were not giving their right names or surnames.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1056"><a name="pos1056"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> For instance Mr Mthembu whom you knew to be owning a taxi, did you know his rank or what position he held in whatever organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1057"><a name="pos1057"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Let me correct this first.  This man did not own taxis.  This name "Somatekisi" was just his pseudonym and that is how we called him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1058"><a name="pos1058"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Taxi man, now I understand you perfectly thank you very much.  Was he a member of any organisation, IFP for instance and what rank did he have when he trained you people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1059"><a name="pos1059"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> He was an IFP member.  He was the commander there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1060"><a name="pos1060"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> I take it, correct me if I am mistaken, that you were trained in handling firearms, how to kill, would I be right to say you're saying so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1061"><a name="pos1061"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes, we were told that we were trained for 1994 election, to kill.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1062"><a name="pos1062"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Could you just tell us more that you were trained for the 1994 elections to do what, to show people how to vote or to kill people not to vote?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1063"><a name="pos1063"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> To kill the ANC leadership.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1064"><a name="pos1064"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Did you know which leaders were you supposed to kill from the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1065"><a name="pos1065"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes, I know a few of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1066"><a name="pos1066"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Would you be kind enough to just give us the few you know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1067"><a name="pos1067"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> The first one was Bongani Msomi in eSikhawini.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1068"><a name="pos1068"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1069"><a name="pos1069"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> The second one was Bheki Ntuli in Mtubatuba.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1070"><a name="pos1070"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Can you remember only the two?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1071"><a name="pos1071"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Mr Nxumalo, here in Eshowe.  Given Mthethwa from Eshowe, Schoolboy from Eshowe, Mr Msweli in Mandini.  Those are the only people who were disturbing the election in KwaZulu Natal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1072"><a name="pos1072"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> I understood you to say to us that Eshowe was an IFP stronghold and I realised that for instance Nxmalo and Mthethwa are also from Eshowe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1073"><a name="pos1073"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> That is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1074"><a name="pos1074"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Now lastly, you mentioned that when you attacked you were accompanied by the KwaZulu Police ...(indistinct)?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1075"><a name="pos1075"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1076"><a name="pos1076"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> And prior to your attack you held a meeting, do you recall that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1077"><a name="pos1077"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1078"><a name="pos1078"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were the KwaZulu Police present in that meeting or if not when did they join you or how did they know that you planned this attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1079"><a name="pos1079"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> The KwaZulu Police would not be present when the decision is taken, but they would be told to go and raid the ANC members after we had taken a decision.  The KwaZulu Police would then be led be Nr Nyawuza where they were supposed to raid.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1080"><a name="pos1080"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Would we understand you correctly that the police, that is the KwaZulu Police, were your allies when you attacked the ANC members, would we understand you to say that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1081"><a name="pos1081"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1082"><a name="pos1082"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Thank you very much Mr Myeza, I have got no further questions.  Thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1083"><a name="pos1083"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well will take the short adjournment now. Mr Brink can we resume at two o'clock?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1084"><a name="pos1084"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1085"><a name="pos1085"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We adjourn now and resume at two o'clock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1086"><a name="pos1086"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line1087"><a name="pos1087"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line1088"><a name="pos1088"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(inaudible) put to this witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1089"><a name="pos1089"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> No thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1090"><a name="pos1090"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Any re-examination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1091"><a name="pos1091"></a><span class="speaker">RE-EXAMINATION BY MR ALBERTS:</span> Just one aspect thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1092"><a name="pos1092"></a>	Before you decided to join the SPU training were you already an IFP member by then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1093"><a name="pos1093"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1094"><a name="pos1094"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> And when you decided ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1095"><a name="pos1095"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I didn't hear him, sorry.  What is the answer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1096"><a name="pos1096"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> ...(inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1097"><a name="pos1097"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> And when you decided to join the SPU training what was your purpose for joining?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1098"><a name="pos1098"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> The reason why I joined the SPU is because I had already been told by Mr Nyawuza that for us to protect the IFP, we had to be trained so that we could carry firearms legally.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1099"><a name="pos1099"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> And these acts that you did commit, apart from thinking that you would get employment, is there any other reason that prompted you or that made you to do this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1100"><a name="pos1100"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> No, there were no other reasons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1101"><a name="pos1101"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman I have got nothing further.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1102"><a name="pos1102"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR ALBERTS</p>
<p class="line" id="line1103"><a name="pos1103"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Mr Myeza you were paid by this financial officer, did I hear you correctly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1104"><a name="pos1104"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1105"><a name="pos1105"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Where was he from, where did he belong to, IFP, SPU?   From where was this official who was paying you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1106"><a name="pos1106"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I do not know whether this person was a member of the IFP or the SPU's.  He was employed in Parliament at Ulundi.  I do not know what his position was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1107"><a name="pos1107"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> In other words you were paid by Ulundi, he was placed at Ulundi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1108"><a name="pos1108"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes, I thought we were paid by the KwaZulu Government.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1109"><a name="pos1109"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Thank you Chairperson I have got no further questions.   Thank you Mr Myeza.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1110"><a name="pos1110"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Just one question on the same subject, did you not regard that as employment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1111"><a name="pos1111"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I had an SPU card but I did not regard myself as someone who was permanently employed as a public servant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1112"><a name="pos1112"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> What was your monthly salary there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1113"><a name="pos1113"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I was paid about R2 800.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1114"><a name="pos1114"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> If you were not employed what did you think this R2 800 was for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1115"><a name="pos1115"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I thought this is the money that was paid to us because we were trained and we had carried the functions we were trained for.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1116"><a name="pos1116"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr Myeza what is employment, is employment not that you are expected to carry out some function?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1117"><a name="pos1117"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I was promised that I was going to be employed as a KwaZulu Police officer.  This did not happen, instead I was a mere SPU member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1118"><a name="pos1118"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Were you employed as a ZP officer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1119"><a name="pos1119"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I think I was being used by them to do their job.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1120"><a name="pos1120"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> What was your employment for and what did they pay you that salary for?  Sorry what did you understand they were thinking, the government was thinking when the government was paying you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1121"><a name="pos1121"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> There were slips to show how much we got whenever we went to Ulundi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1122"><a name="pos1122"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did you get a monthly slip with your salary?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1123"><a name="pos1123"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1124"><a name="pos1124"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you tell us that - sorry, carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1125"><a name="pos1125"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Just one question, was any tax deducted? Did they show deductions on your slips?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1126"><a name="pos1126"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> That is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1127"><a name="pos1127"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I thought I heard you say during your evidence that this money that you were getting from Ulundi stopped when a middle man disappeared or left. Can you clear that up first of all?   Who was the middle man and what do you mean by he disappeared or he left, what does that mean?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1128"><a name="pos1128"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I did not know the name of this middleman.  However, when all KwaZulu-Natal SPU members were called to Ulundi to get their monies, that was Friday, we went to camp at Emandleni.  The following Saturday, we went to the soccer field in E section in Ulundi, and we were told that this person had run away.  We barricaded the Parliament in protest of our salaries and demanded to talk to Mr Powell himself.  He came and told us that that person had run away.  He left Ulundi.  I did not know his name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1129"><a name="pos1129"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Mr Myeza was this man, the middle man white or black?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1130"><a name="pos1130"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> He was black.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1131"><a name="pos1131"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr Myeza, when were you arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1132"><a name="pos1132"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I was arrested in 1995.  These people no longer wanted to see me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1133"><a name="pos1133"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But in 1995 you were still paid when you were carrying out some of these orders as you told us in your evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1134"><a name="pos1134"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> It was in 1995 when the payments stopped.  I was then arrested when I came back from Ulundi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1135"><a name="pos1135"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Was it not because you were arrested that you couldn't go and collect your money?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1136"><a name="pos1136"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> I cannot say, but we had a stay-away the last time I went to Ulundi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1137"><a name="pos1137"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So it wasn't just your money, all the others who were with you also didn't get their money?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1138"><a name="pos1138"></a><span class="speaker">MR MYEZA:</span> Yes.  All of us did not get our money.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1139"><a name="pos1139"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you very much. You are excused. You can move off from there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1140"><a name="pos1140"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line1141"><a name="pos1141"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you thinking of calling any other witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1142"><a name="pos1142"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1143"><a name="pos1143"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Brink?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1144"><a name="pos1144"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> I am not calling witnesses Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1145"><a name="pos1145"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  Is there anything you wish to say to us in argument?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1146"><a name="pos1146"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS IN ARGUMENT:</span> Firstly the one incident where the evidence was that it happened in 1995.  In the statement given by the applicant he mentioned before the election 1994.  I would ask the Commission not to make a finding on that, whether it fell within or without the cut-off date before all the information was gathered by Mr Brink.  There were some inconsistencies in his evidence especially where dates and times etc., was not, could not be remembered but it is my submission it happened some time ago, at least four years, five years ago and it is a number of incidents and where he could not remember or he could not give exact details or where it seems he might have contradicted himself it might well have been as a result of the long time period and the number of incidents in which he was in fact involved, that some of the details got confused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1147"><a name="pos1147"></a>	It is my submission that the actions that he did perpetrate was according to his evidence for political motives.  He was instructed by this Nyawuza to commit certain acts on behalf of Nyawuza for Nyawuza's political gain and then to assist the IFP in winning the elections.  Also the evidence he gave later on regarding the SPU's etc, he had a bona fide belief that what was done was for the political gain of the IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1148"><a name="pos1148"></a>	It is my submission he did tell the truth, although sometimes he was not all that really clear as I have already stated.  He might well not remember everything as clearly because he is not a well-educated man it seems from the fact that he is not able to read English, his thumb print was annexed to his affidavit, etc.  Therefore I have requested the Commission to make a finding that he was truthful in what he did say to the Commission. </p>
<p class="line" id="line1149"><a name="pos1149"></a>	The one aspect that might cause a problem  is Section 23 (f) 1.  It is my submission that he was a member of the IFP even before he joined the SPU.  He did say that the only reason for his actions was to get employment and for the money. I don't know whether one can take this into Section 22(b) or (c), I'm sorry, (c) or (d) as being employed to do this. I will leave that in the hands of  ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1150"><a name="pos1150"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1151"><a name="pos1151"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> No, Section 23(f) deals with a personal gain.  Section 22(c) and (d) deals with a person that is employed by somebody committing certain acts on behalf of that party or government.   We do not know where the funding came from.  I will leave that aspect in the hands of the Commission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1152"><a name="pos1152"></a>	It is my submission that his amnesty should be considered.  Is there anything else that the Commission would like to hear me on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1153"><a name="pos1153"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It is quite clear that it can't be said that he acted on behalf of the KZN government?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1154"><a name="pos1154"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1155"><a name="pos1155"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And nor can it be said that he was acting on the instructions of the Inkatha Freedom Party?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1156"><a name="pos1156"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Yes Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1157"><a name="pos1157"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So he was carrying out the wishes of a man called Nyawuza?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1158"><a name="pos1158"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1159"><a name="pos1159"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  Mr Brink?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1160"><a name="pos1160"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK IN ARGUMENT:</span> Very briefly Mr Chairman, as far as the application relating to Ntuli is concerned and that is the one where in his sworn statement he indicated that that took place before the elections of 1994.  He made it quite clear that this murder was committed after he had been released from prison in July 1994 which clearly puts it beyond the cut-off date. While it is perfectly true that the man's memory was to some extent unreliable, likewise his sworn affidavit was unreliable so you can't place any value on what he said in that statement relating to when Ntuli's murder took place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1161"><a name="pos1161"></a>	The second point I wish to make is that he clearly was, as Mr Chairman has pointed out, not acting on behalf of the IFP as a political party or indeed on behalf of the KwaZulu government at that time.   It appears that he comes close to the personal gain matter which is referred to in Section 20 subsection (1). (a) I: Personal gain.  His evidence was that he would not have committed any of these offences had he not been made an offer of employment and of gainful employment that is.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1162"><a name="pos1162"></a>	My submission Mr Chairman, that can well be interpreted as having done these things for personal gain, promise of a job in the then KwaZulu Police. Those are my submissions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1163"><a name="pos1163"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr Alberts, this question really is to Mr Brink too, on the evidence he was indeed employed, he was paid at Ulundi at the government offices on a monthly basis, quite a sizeable salary of R2 800 a month.  Why should that not be construed as employment by the government?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1164"><a name="pos1164"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Well it may have been some kind of slush fund payment Mr Chairman.  There is no evidence that this was KwaZulu government money.  He said he didn't pay tax or tax wasn't deducted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1165"><a name="pos1165"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(inaudible) secret fund.  Yes, thank you very much.  The Committee will wait until we get clarity in respect of the attitude of the victims of those who were involved in the applications he made which are not referred to in his application form but which are referred to in his affidavit.  I trust in that counsel will sort out this among themselves before the necessary document is placed before us.  It might be in the form of an affidavit or affidavits from clients. You will show them to counsel ...(indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1166"><a name="pos1166"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Yes. Mr Chairman when I return to Cape Town I will give immediate instructions for investigations to be done in regard to tracing the next-of-kin victims and the like in respect of all those matters but the one reservation I have, if the Ntuli matter is excluded then it would be pointless.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1167"><a name="pos1167"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well I can understand that.  Yes I mean if it falls outside the cut-off date then the Committee has no discretion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1168"><a name="pos1168"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Ja. I don't know whether the Committee is in a position to make a ruling on that aspect of his application at this stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1169"><a name="pos1169"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, we don't make any rulings at this stage you know, but you know that on the evidence as it stands this was after the cut off date?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1170"><a name="pos1170"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1171"><a name="pos1171"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That is the end of the matter isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1172"><a name="pos1172"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1173"><a name="pos1173"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But without making a final ruling on the matter it seems that that seems to be the position.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1174"><a name="pos1174"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1175"><a name="pos1175"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Very well, the Committee will reserve its decision and give it after it has received such information as might be thought appropriate by counsel in this matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1176"><a name="pos1176"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Mr Chairman, may we then adjourn for a matter of two minutes so the representatives can be reconstituted and the new applicants brought in in the next matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1177"><a name="pos1177"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  We will step down for a few minutes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1178"><a name="pos1178"></a><span class="speaker">COMMITTEE ADJOURNS:</span> .</p>
