            "Mr Chairman, I really only began to become interested in  politics in 1980 while  I was at university in Bloemfontein.  That year there was a general election, and we as students were recruited to help with this election.  Former Minister Kobie Coetzee stood there for the National Party and I served in his team to work on voting day.  In fact he won that election and that was a great pleasure for all of us.\nAfter that I went to the defence force for my national service.  In 1983 there was a referendum.  We were in the defence force and we had a very restricted knowledge of what was going on outside.  On a particular morning we were told here's a referendum, you're are in the defence force, you vote for the Government so you must say \"Yes\".\nAnd so then I did vote yes without really knowing what was going on.  After the completion of my national service, I became increasingly involved in politics and particularly right-wing politics.  It became very clear to me that what the National Party had promised before the referendum of '83 had not been complied with or achieved.  On the contrary, certain things that they said, they had gone on to do precisely the opposite.  This upset me greatly and I listed increasingly to and became increasingly involved in the Conservative Party and in conservative politics.\nI joined them, and in the next election I worked for them.  I canvassed for them and went from house to house and I also acted as an electoral agent on various occasions.  In about 1987 I was approached by a friend who invited me to an AWB meeting.  I attended it and I found it most interesting.\nWhat was said there was very interesting, and it was precisely reflected my feelings and I became convinced that I should join the AWB and I did so.  I also progressed in the AWB.  At Kempton Park I even became the leader of the so-called Burgerraad.  In 1990 I moved from Witwatersrand to Richards Bay where I began my own business.\nI became acquainted with a person, and from our conversation it became clear that he was a member of the AWB and that is how he introduced himself to me.  A little while later he introduced me to Mr Botha as the local leader/Kommandant of the AWB.",

In other words I didn't want to be visible, but I would make myself available for anything which he had to do for me - had for me to do.\n\tWe thought this was a good idea, because at that stage the AWB had been so infiltrated by the security police that I thought there were more security police than others in the AWB.  I attended an AWB meeting in Richards Bay, incognito because I was a photographer and I went there without a uniform and I took photos and I looked like any other person attending.

You must understand that on that day, we were reacting to news reports on the media.\nThe first report I listened to that morning referred to members of the PAC breaking into a shop, stole knives and summarily attacked Whites.  In other words it's not that we -  hadn't heard that it was possible, or hoped that it might be so - this is what we believed happened and that was how the news was relayed to us.

We, in cleaning-up operations in Kempton Park area, we went to a shebeen and while we were raiding the shebeen we came to a squatter camp.  It was pretty well hidden, you couldn't see it from anywhere, it was only when we were on top of it that we noticed it, so I believe that very few people were aware of the place.\nThe local residents saw us approaching because we were in uniform and in military vehicles and so they fled.  We did a sweeping operation in the squatter camp and we found a number of items, things such as typewriters and various equipment - a tremendous amount of equipment.  At a particular stage I entered a shack.  I was alone.  There was a plastic sheet under the bed on the ground.  I picked it up and under that there was a bag - a plastic bag, and I found inside it an AK47 with magazines and ammunition.\nBecause I am quite a rifle enthusiast I wanted to keep this weapon to myself and I didn't want to tell anybody about it, and I took the rifle and I hid it in the grass outside, it was quite near the main road.  That afternoon we returned from the camp.  At that stage we could go home every second evening.  I went to my car and went to pick up the AK47 and I took it home.",

We also saw it as a direct consequence of the National Party Government's decision on the 2nd of February 1990, to unban the so-called liberation movements and to free the present President.\nWe believed that this would not only lead to the destruction of the Afrikaners, but that it would also cause violence and we would be literally obliterated.  At that stage we thought that what had happened after colonialisation, or after decolonisation in other African countries, Uhuru - that would happen here.  We got into the car and left for Durban.\nOn the way we decided amongst ourselves that we would have to identify a suitable target.

We followed it into a residential area, but the circumstances were not conducive to a successful attack, so we abandoned the plan.  \n\tWe turned round.

In a taxi there is a terribly high concentration of people sitting close to one another.  In a bus they are more widely dispersed, there's more space between the people.\nIf we wanted to kill more people we could have stopped there.
