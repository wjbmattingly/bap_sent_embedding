<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Today we are going to hear the application of Nyawose Ziphakamise aka Khumalo which is application AM6192/97.  Ms Thabethe and Mr Mlungisi, I hope we are now ready to proceed.  We should have commenced with this application at 9 o'clock.  Again our proceedings have been delayed for almost an hour.  I do not expect you to advance any reasons for the delay.  I however which to register our dissatisfaction with the manner in which these proceedings are going.  We hope and trust that we will always be time conscious because if we are not, we will not be in a position to conduct our proceedings in an equitable manner.  I expect counsels and lawyers to conduct themselves in a proper manner and that includes observing the time that we have mutually set as a Committee in consultation with counsel and lawyers.  I shall now give Mr Molohlanye an opportunity to commence with Mr Nyawose aka Khumalo's application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> Thank you Madame Chair.  I'd like to apologise for the delay and I would like to call the applicant in this matter Ziphakamise Nyawose aka Khumalo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Khumalo, will you please come forward?  Mr Khumalo, which is your correct surname?  Is it Khumalo or Nyawose?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYAWOSE:</span> Nyawose.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you also use Khumalo as a surname?</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYAWOSE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Which surname should we use?  Khumalo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYAWOSE:</span> Nyawose.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">ZIPHAKAMISE NYAWOSE:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Before you proceed, Mr Molohlanye, I note that you have now handed up another affidavit further to the affidavit that was handed up to the Committee on Monday which paragraphs are different from the ones that was handed to us on Monday.  Are you in a position to quickly point to us which paragraphs have been included or have been amended from the one that we had on Monday?</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> Thank you Chairperson.  There has been several changes in the affidavit as such.  We'll start at the first one, was in connection to paragraph 1 and the second one is paragraph 5 and paragraph 9, there was a change also there.  Paragraph 10 was also a change.  Paragraph 11 there was a change but I'm not in the position of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Paragraph 11 resembles the old paragraph 12.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> You've combined paragraphs 9 and 10?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a>	Also changes in paragraph 12.  According to the new affidavit it's paragraph 11 and paragraph 13 of the old affidavit which is now paragraph 12.  That's how far the changes have been.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Am I correct in saying that the essential paragraph for this application is paragraphs 11 and 12?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> That is correct, Honourable Member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You will recall that you were to apply for an amendment?  Could you please proceed to do so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> Thank you.  Before I do so, Madame Chair, I've noticed that after paragraph 19, paragraph 20 to 21 of this is missing in your affidavit.  Can I ask our logistical manager to make copies for you before we proceed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Sorry Madame Chair, if I may just intervene here for a moment?  Madame Chair, I've been given the amended affidavit as of now as well as the old affidavit as of now.  Madame Chair, in the circumstances would it not be advisable that my learned friend get the entire documentation in order so that I can be put in a position to follow what is happening because given the missing pages as my learned friend has indicated to Madame Chair that paragraph 21 of the amended affidavit is now not in it's place, I don't have that as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you will have it, I mean it is now going to be distributed to all the parties involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> Madame Chair, I'd like to proceed with my application for an amendment.  Madame Chair, I'd like to apply for an amendment in terms of the application by the applicant Mr Nyawose.  Mr Nyawose originally applied for amnesty for a murder, for the killing of Mr Bhukunda Cele only and apparently Mr Khumalo was convicted of murder, attempted murder and escaping from prison.  I therefore apply to this Committee that we include the attempted murder and escaping from prison because they form part of the same act.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> On what bases would you include the act of escape in your application for an amendment of this application?  We have no problem with regard to the act of attempted murder of Mr Ngcobo being included as an act which was omitted specifically as an act was omitted in his amnesty application because it arose out of the same incident to which he applied originally in his amnesty application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> I therefore withdraw the escaping from imprisonment, your Honour.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Your application for amnesty to include the act of attempted murder of Mr Ngcobo is granted.  The applicant will now lead evidence in respect ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Can we just hear whether there is an objection?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You are representing the interests of the victims?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> That is correct, Madame Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can we have your name on record?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> It's Mr Panday, P-A-N-D-A-Y.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Panday, an application has been made by Mr Molohlanye to include the act of attempted murder of Mr Ngcobo on whose interests we are now appearing today.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Your Worship, I represent the victim Goodman Ngcobo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, an application has been made to include the act of attempting to kill Mr Ngcobo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> No there is no objection ...(indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Your application is accordingly granted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> Thank you Honourable Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You may proceed to lead evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a>	Mr Khumalo, we have been given an affidavit.  This will be Exhibit A, page 21 has not yet reached my hands, I mean paragraph 20 to 21 has not yet reached our hands?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> Thank you Chairperson.  I think the logistical managers are making copies.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Has paragraph 20 and 21 been read to Mr Khumalo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> Yes they have been.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Khumalo, is this affidavit the affidavit that you have deposed to?  Mr Khumalo, did you depose to this affidavit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYAWOSE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you understand the contents of this affidavit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYAWOSE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Had you confirmed that they are true?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYAWOSE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We will then accept Mr Molohlanye this as Exhibit A.  You don't need to lead him on any aspect which is contained in this affidavit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> That is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MOLOHLANYE</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Panday, is there anything that you - are there any questions that you wish to put to Mr Khumalo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Madame Chair ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I am mindful of the fact that you don't have paragraph 20 and 21.  I think the crux of the matter really lies in what is contained from paragraph 10 or from paragraph 1 to approximately paragraph 12 which really gives an indication of what actually happened prior to the incident and what happened during the incident in question.  The other paragraphs relates to what happened after this incident which I think this Committee is least concerned with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Madame Chair, I accept what Madame Chair has said.  As I've mentioned, I don't have in my possession the original affidavit that was handed up to Madame Chair and the members.  Now at this stage I'm not in a position to comment on both the affidavits that have been handed up or direct any questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> There is only one affidavit that has been handed up and that's the affidavit that we have now accepted as Exhibit A.  Don't you have a copy of this affidavit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Madame Chair, I have parts of it, I'm just waiting for the completed affidavit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If you don't I will give you my copy.  Do you require time now to adjourn in order to have sight of this affidavit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Yes Madame Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Let's just get this straight.  Do you agree that the murder and the attempted murder applied for were acts related to the political struggle at the time in the vicinity?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> That point is accepted, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The only point of course that you raised with us in chambers is that of full disclosure and you would want to have sight of the affidavit to be able to be satisfied that the applicant has satisfied that requirement of full disclosure.  We'll grant you a two minute adjournment to enable you to go through the affidavit and to be able to come back and take instructions to see whether the full disclosure has been complied with by Mr Khumalo.  Will that be sufficient time for you to consult with Mr Ngcobo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Yes Madame Chair, that will be sufficient, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> As the Committee pleases.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We'll adjourn for two minutes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Panday, are you in a position to proceed Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Yes Madame Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Have you now taken instructions from Mr Ngcobo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Yes Madame Chair, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR PANDAY:</span> Yes Madame Chair, just a few.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a>	Mr Khumalo, in your affidavit handed up today, in paragraph 9 you say that you were approached by Tokozani who was the member of the ANC and informed you of the fighting that was taking place.  What position did Tokozani hold in the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYAWOSE:</span> He was an ANC member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I'm not getting any translation, are you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a>I think there's a problem with my set.  You may proceed Mr Panday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Mr Khumalo, I know that he was an ANC member.  I want to know what position he held in the ANC.  Was he a marshall, was - he held some higher position in the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYAWOSE:</span> He used to be a marshall sometimes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> And is he from the area that you lived in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYAWOSE:</span> Would you please repeat that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Tokozani, was he from the area that you lived in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYAWOSE:</span> They were still building a house there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was he from where you were staying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYAWOSE:</span> No they were from Mabaleni, that's where they were staying before and then they just came to the area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In other words he was in your area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYAWOSE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Mr Khumalo, you thereafter mention in paragraph 10 that you went to Sitombi's place with two other gentlemen to attack this place.  You say one of them was Duleng Cele, that's the one you can remember.  Do you know who brought the second gentleman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYAWOSE:</span> Yes I do know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Who brought him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYAWOSE:</span> They both came with Tokozani and I was the fourth one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> May I interpose Mr Panday?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a>	Were these people members of the ANC to your knowledge, the ones that Tokozani brought with them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYAWOSE:</span> Yes they were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you know the surname of Tokozani?</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYAWOSE:</span> Yes I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What's his surname?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYAWOSE:</span> Tokozani Mbele.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes and is Sitombe, that Mr Panday has questioned you about, the same person as Mr Ngcobo?  Is that Goodman Ngcobo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYAWOSE:</span> Yes, his name is Goodman Sitombe Ngcobo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  You may proceed Mr Panday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Mr Khumalo, I'm going to take you back to the time you gave a statement or a confession to a magistrate.  Do you remember that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYAWOSE:</span> Yes I do remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Right.  Would you be able to remember the statement you gave to the magistrate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYAWOSE:</span> Even though I cannot remember very well because when I made the statement I was not well, I was forced and also I was trying to run away from being found guilty or having committed the crime.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Mr Khumalo ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Oh, you lied in that statement, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYAWOSE:</span> Yes that is correct, in court.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Mr Khumalo, do you remember in court they were arguing to accept your statement or not accept your statement, do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Panday, where is this going to get us in terms of you being able to explore whether in his amnesty application he has made a full disclosure?  He has already admitted not to have been entirely true in that statement.  Is there a point to which you are getting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Yes Madame Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You obviously now have taken instructions and if there is anything in terms of what is contained before us in this affidavit, that would indicate that he is not telling the truth.  Wouldn't it actually expedite matters if you were to put those things that you do not entirely agree with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> As you please, Madame Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a>	Mr Khumalo, when you made the statement you mentioned that you had gone to Durban and fetched nine other men and come back to Sitombe's place, do you recall that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYAWOSE:</span> Yes I do remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What page is that, won't you tell us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> That's page 21 of the bundle of documents that was given to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes we have that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Seven lines down from the top, Madame Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a>	Now Mr Khumalo, why now in your paragraph in your affidavit you mention only two others accompanied you to Sitombe's place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYAWOSE:</span> I said there were nine from Durban before.  The truth is that we were four and out of these four I only knew one person.  The other one I didn't know and then I knew Tokozani and myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> So are you saying that you lied that there was nine of you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That's what he's saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Now Mr Khumalo, which are we to believe, nine or four?</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He is telling you he's now telling the truth, he lied in the statement he made before the magistrate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYAWOSE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Mr Khumalo, in paragraph 11 of your affidavit you mention you had hand grenades and AK-47s.  Where did you get the hand grenade from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYAWOSE:</span> Tokozani brought it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> And the AK-47s?</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYAWOSE:</span> Tokozani as well brought the AK-47.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did Tokozani give an indication from where he had obtained these weapons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYAWOSE:</span> No, he didn't give me any indication and also myself I didn't even ask him because I actually admired the fact that he had these weapons with him because I also needed weapons and what I had with me, I wasn't happy about it because it was a SP12.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes Mr Panday?</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> So Mr Khumalo, is it correct that the entire factions that took place was not as a result of your brother being killed by Sitombe and his friends, it is what Tokozani came and told you, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYAWOSE:</span> It was everything together.  Tokozani was being harassed by these people, also myself.  I decided that I should accompany Tokozani and if I were to die I was ready to do so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Thank you Madame Chair, nothing further.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR PANDAY</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Panday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS THABETHE:</span> Thank you Madame Chair, I have one question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a>	Mr Khumalo, why was Bhukunda Cele and Mr Ngcobo </p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a>killed?  Why was Bhukunda Cele killed and Mr Ngcobo injured?</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYAWOSE:</span> Ngcobo was our enemy, he used to attack the ANC organisation or members and my aim was not to kill Cele, my aim was to kill Ngcobo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> No further questions, Madame Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS THABETHE</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you say your aim was not to kill Cele but to kill Ngcobo, how was Mr Cele killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYAWOSE:</span> Cele was caught in a crossfire because he was at Ngcobo's place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you left that day to attack Mr Ngcobo's house did you know that Mr Ngcobo would not be the only occupant in the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYAWOSE:</span> No we didn't know that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What were your intentions when you left, were your intentions not to attack Mr Ngcobo's house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYAWOSE:</span> Yes, they were to attack Mr Ngcobo's house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes and by attacking Mr Ngcobo's house that would include attacking anyone who was also inside the house is it not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYAWOSE:</span> We thought that he was alone inside the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In your affidavit you've stated that your house had also previously been attacked, do you recall that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYAWOSE:</span> Yes I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And who had attacked your house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYAWOSE:</span> Dodo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who is Dodo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYAWOSE:</span> Dodo Mbambo and Mshlate, his brother and Tokozani.</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Tokozani Cele?</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYAWOSE:</span> Tokozani Blosi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And to which political organisation did these people belong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYAWOSE:</span> IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And then your house was attacked, was it an indiscriminate attack on your house or did they shoot at your house and the people who were inside the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYAWOSE:</span> No, they didn't shoot at the people, they came straight and they said they were looking for me and they were told that I wasn't there and they said they must tell me when I come back that they will come back for me and they will catch me and they left.  They met my sister on the street, they chased her away until she ran to my uncle's place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why was your sister actually chased away?</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYAWOSE:</span> I don't have any idea because she's a female.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you took a decision to attack Mr Ngcobo's house what objective did you seek to achieve by that attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYAWOSE:</span> Our objectives was to kill him so that the violence will deteriorate because at that time it had gone up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was it your intention to kill any person who would have been in the house and whom you thought was an IFP person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYAWOSE:</span> No, it wasn't my aim, my aim was to just kill Mr Ngcobo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you not fighting the IFP, were you not having continuous running battles as an ANC member with IFP people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYAWOSE:</span> No, we didn't want to have continuous fights with the IFP.  We didn't want to fight every single supporter of the IFP.  The only problem with Mr Ngcobo was that he was the one who used to attack us.  He shot at us and I think I know the reason why he shot us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why did he shoot at you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYAWOSE:</span> ANC supporters or members killed his mother but I wasn't part of those attackers who attacked and killed his mother.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When was that?  Was it also in 1993?</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYAWOSE:</span> I think it was 1990, I'm not sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Would I therefore be correct in assuming that there were continuous fights between members of the ANC and the IFP in your area from 1990 to 1993?</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYAWOSE:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And that the members of one political organisation were killing members of the other political organisations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYAWOSE:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And the organisations concerned were ANC and IFP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYAWOSE:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And that you personally were aggrieved by the fact that your own brother had been killed in this conflict between the two political organisations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYAWOSE:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And that you also intended to kill members of the IFP because of this political conflict that you had?</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYAWOSE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr Nyawose, referring to the first paragraph of your affidavit, the killing of the mother of Sitombe Ngcobo, do you know who attacked and killed her?  You said they were other members of the ANC, do you know any of them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYAWOSE:</span> Yes there are some people that I know that they were among the group who killed the mother.</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Can you mention some of those names that you can remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYAWOSE:</span> Yes I will mention the ones that I remember and unfortunately some of them they passed away.  Vusi Nglovo, Thabani Nglovo, they are brothers and the others I don't remember because there were quite a number of ANC supporters who came to visit to the area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Do you know or did you know a person Dan Cele?</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYAWOSE:</span> Yes I know Dan Cele.</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Was he involved in that attack to your knowledge?</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYAWOSE:</span> Yes, he was present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Was he one of the comrades, Dan Cele?</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYAWOSE:</span> Yes he was an ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Was he a youth leader in the youth league?</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYAWOSE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Were you a member of the youth league?</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYAWOSE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did you hold any position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYAWOSE:</span> No I didn't have a specific position but they would sometimes put me in any position wherever there was a vacancy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And Tokozani who accompanied you in this attack, was he a leader?</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYAWOSE:</span> Sometimes he would be a marshall since he was working and if he wasn't at work then he will be a marshall in the meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Molohlanye, I take it that you wouldn't be bold enough to wish to re-examine?</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> Yes there's only one question I want to ask to ask.</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you want to be bold?  Yes, I will allow you to re-examine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">RE-EXAMINATION BY MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a>	Mr Nyawose, now that you divulge all your participation in all these acts, how do you feel now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That is not re-examination.</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> My pardon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You can re-examine on anything that came out of Mr Panday's questioning, Ms Thabethe and the Committee's questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> No re-examination.</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You can apply to reopen your evidence in chief to ask Mr Khumalo that question.  You may apply to reopen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> Thank you your Worship, I therefore apply for opening of ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It's granted, you may put that question to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a>	Mr Nyawose, now that you've divulged all your participation and your role in the attacks during the killing of Mr Cele and the attempted murder of Mr Ngcobo, how do you feel now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYAWOSE:</span> I have great regrets and I realise the one thing that what I've done I've done it because I was heartbroken and it wasn't so necessary.  I regret whatever I've done and I feel remorse.</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> Mr Nyawose, have you met any of the victims which are involved in this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYAWOSE:</span> If you could please repeat that for me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> Have you met any of the victims involved in this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYAWOSE:</span> Yes I have.</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> How is your relationship or what did you say to them or how do you relate ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Molohlanye, you applied to reopen your evidence in chief and I granted you that indulgence.  It was for only one question.  You have exhausted that one question.  I don't think this Committee can really be burdened about the relation that he has with the victims.  It is common knowledge, it is known to all and sundry that this process is about reconciliation but pertinently we have to be satisfied with regard to whether the applicant in this case, Mr Khumalo, has made a full disclosure and whether the evidence complies with the requirements of Section 20, that is what we have to do.  If he wishes to speak to the victims which we will always encourage as a Committee, because we are about reconciliation, he is free to do so.  This can be facilitated by our logistics officer, Joe is here around, he can facilitate that, Melani is here, he can facilitate that, we always encourage that but that need not really form part of the record.</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> Thank you Chairperson, I'll withdraw my question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Malan would like to ask Mr Khumalo one</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a>question which might impinge on what you wanted to elicit from Mr Khumalo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr Nyawose, have you since met Goodman Ngcobo, Sitombe Ngcobo?</p>

<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Is he in the same prison with you?</p>

<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think that should conclude your re-examination, sorry your evidence-in-chief?</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you now in a position to address us on any issue with regard to Mr Khumalo's application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE IN ARGUMENT:</span> Yes, I am in a position to address, thank you Madame Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a>	I hereby make a submission in regard to the application of Mr Nyawose in that Mr Nyawose have met all the requirements in terms of the Act, especially Section 20 sub-section 2(a) where Mr Nyawose has divulged or disclosed all the relevant facts in the act in which he was associated with a political objective and Mr Nyawose was a member of a political organisation which was publicly known and his acts where a struggle waged against another political organisation which was publicly known and therefore in terms of Section 20 sub-section 2(f) this person, who was Mr Nyawose, was acting in the course or scope of his duties, within the duties or implied authority of the political organisation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Wouldn't he fall pertinently under paragraph (a) rather than (f)?  Wouldn't that be your argument that he falls squarely within the provisions of 20, sub-section 2?</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> That will be so Madame Chair and also further in my submission that in terms of sub-section 3 of Section 20, the criteria which is used in the granting of the amnesty, I believe that Mr Nyawose qualifies in terms from (a) to (f).</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Mr Panday?</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY IN ARGUMENT:</span> Thank you Madame Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a>	Madame Chair, insofar as the political objective of the applicant is concerned, I think that is now common cause before this Committee that that is not in dispute.  Obviously the only issue that now comes to light as to whether there has been full disclosure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a>	Madame Chair, insofar as the issue of full disclosure is, we've had Mr Khumalo explain to us how the entire incident had taken place at the place of Sitombe Ngcobo's residence, how the killing had led or what led to the killings, Madame Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a>	Madame Chair, it's therefore my submission insofar as to whether what he has put before this Commission as to whether that is full disclosure, Madame Chair.  That would have to be left in the hands of the Commission to come to a conclusion whether that satisfies the test of full disclosure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But you yourself have not put anything in dispute, you've not disputed the evidence with regard to his explanation as to how the incident occurred, have you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> That is accepted, Madame.</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You have not put any different version?</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> That is true Madame Chair insofar as the victims concerned was at this stage as to whether there was just full disclosure.</p>

<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Yes Madame Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And would it be your submission that amnesty should therefore be granted to him?</p>
