<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> It would be that the persons would be armed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did this vehicle stop at the pre-appointed place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> No, it passed that point, Chairperson.</p>

<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> Yes, we ran closer and shots were fired.  Bullets hit the ground, hit the tar road between myself and Rorich.  I fell down behind the vehicle and it was a few seconds and everything came to an end.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Just one moment, you say a bullet hit the tar road where you and Mr Rorich, a fellow applicant who still has to give evidence, were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Could you determine where the shot came from?</p>

<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you see a person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> I suspected that it was the person who had jumped out of the left side of the vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Would that be an occupant of the kombi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And was there a mark on the tar surface which was visible for later investigation?</p>

<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And was it indicated during later investigations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> You say you ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Excuse me, just one moment before you continue.  The bullet mark, did you see it or how do you have knowledge of it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> Later we found the place on the surface of the tar road.  I cannot recall how long afterwards, a few days afterwards, I cannot recall, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You say we, did you go back to the place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> Excuse me, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did you go back to the place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> Yes, later a reconstruction was held and we went back to the place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And when the reconstruction was held, was that not a long time after the incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And you still found the mark in the tar road?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> Clearly, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Was that the first time that you saw the mark in the road?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Sorry, can I just get clarity on that?  You say the shot hit the ground between you and Rorich, you saw that and then later on when you came to reconstruct, you found that same mark?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> I just wanted to understand that.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Besides what you saw with reconstruction, but that evening you saw the bullets hitting the surface of the tar?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> That's correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And you, when you fired on that vehicle, did you fire, shoot to kill?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> With which weapon did you fire?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> With an R1, my official weapon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And you say after the shots ceased, which happened seconds, it was determined that people were killed there in the vehicle?</p>

<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And the specific action this evening, did you see this as an execution of your general duties?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> Yes, it was in the execution of my duties.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And you, at a later stage, I refer the Committee , Chairperson,  to bundle 5 page 53 as it is paginated, there is a statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>

<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> The date is not very clear but it seems to be 1989, it seems like the 14th. I cannot make out the month Chairperson, maybe somebody could assist us here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a>Can you recall in which month this statement was made?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> I cannot recall Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> This statement was made for the purpose of a death inquest.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And in that statement you indicated that Maj Deetlefs was the person who was in command?</p>

<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> While Col de Kok's name was omitted from this statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No mention is made of him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> Not at all, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And mention is also made of a blue light.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> There was no such thing, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Is that part of your statement false where Col de Kock is not mentioned, what his role was and you have heard what his role was in this application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And you omitted that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> Yes, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And you created the impression that there was a road-block in which the people were killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And that was false?</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> Yes, that is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And you knew by submitting a false statement, and you give evidence afterwards, it would be perjury?</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And you knew it was defeating the ends of justice?</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Can you recall whether you gave evidence at the inquest?</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> No, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Who, or let me ask you as follows, why did you omit Col de Kock's presence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> Because it came to light that we should not mention Col de Kock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you receive such an instruction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> From whom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> I cannot recall, possibly from Maj Deetlefs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Was Maj Deetlefs your Commander at that stage in Ermelo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> He was my direct Commander, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> So you served under his command?</p>

<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR LAMEY:</span> Thank you Chairperson.  Mr van Zweel, the person who fired the shots, was he on his feet outside the kombi or in which position was he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> I suspected it was the person who jumped out left, I cannot be 100% certain but the bullet came from that vicinity.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAMEY:</span> So you don't know whether it was that person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> I cannot confirm that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAMEY:</span> Is it possible that shots could have gone off while you were firing, that you inferred that that bullet hit the road there and that was the spark and you assumed that, the recollection is that it came from that direction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> Yes, it may be a bullet that must have ricocheted from somewhere.</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAMEY:</span> So you cannot say with clear certainty that he fired the shot before Mr de Kock fired at him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> No, I cannot be certain, it happened very quickly.</p>

<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Moerane, any questions you'd like to put to the witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MOERANE:</span> Mr van Zweel, for how many years before this incident were you a member of the Security Police at Ermelo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> Since 1983 I have been a member of the Security Branch at Ermelo.  I started in '83 at Ermelo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> And as a member of the Security Branch, particularly in those years, the 80's, was it one of your main duties to investigate ANC related matters?</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> That's correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> And for that purpose I take it you had to have contact with Middelburg, with Piet Retief?</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> That's correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> And was there general co-operation between the Security Police in the Eastern Transvaal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> That's correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> From time to time from the 80's did you make use of the people from Vlakplaas, de Kock's people, for operations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> Yes, we did make use of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> From that time, from the 80's did you believe that you could do things that were illegal in discharging your functions as a member of the Security Police, against the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> I believed that one could act against the ANC because they were illegal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> So was it ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think the question was, sorry Mr Moerane, it didn't seem to be a correct answer.  What Mr Moerane was asking you is did you believe that you as police could become involved in illegal acts when acting against the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> Yes, I believed so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> And would I be correct to say that was the general culture of the Security Branch in the Eastern Transvaal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> Please repeat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Was that part of the general culture amongst the Security Branch in the Eastern Transvaal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> No, I wouldn't say that Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Where did you get that impression from therefore that you could engage in unlawful activities when you were pursuing the ANC or acting against the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> In that instance at Piet Retief, we acted illegally.  We killed the people there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Yes, but what I am trying to find out from you is whence came this idea that you could act unlawfully when acting against the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> No, Mr van Zweel, maybe it will assist you to use the translators because the answer you have just given doesn't make sense in relation to the question.  I'm sure it's a language, either language or you can't hear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> I don't hear him properly, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just try with the earphones Mr van Zweel, it might facilitate your hearing.  Could you please, Mr Moerane, repeat the question again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Yes.  Mr van Zweel, where did you get the idea from that you could act illegally when acting against the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> With the incident in Piet Retief.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> No, but before that, before the 12th June 1988, I understood you to be saying that you could act illegally against the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> I cannot recall if this was the incident in Swaziland, whether it was before or after.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> I'm talking about an incident that you have mentioned in the present application.  That incident was in 1984.</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Yes, so by the time 1988 came, 12th June, you knew or at least you believed that you could engage in illegal acts against the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Now my question is, where did you get that idea from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> I observed it myself that we had to act against the ANC because they infiltrated the country illegally, committed illegal acts and so forth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Sorry, Mr Moerane.  Mr van Zweel, let me speak to you in Afrikaans.  The question is, did you believe that you may commit illegal acts against the ANC, in other words that rules were not applicable, or that you did not have to adhere to prescriptions when you acted against the ANC?  Now why did you think...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What was the answer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No. Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> The question was put to you in English whether you thought that you could use illegal methods in actions against the ANC and you said that you believed so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> I misunderstood there, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But you also said on a further question that you observed illegal actions being used against the ANC.  You referred to the incident at Piet Retief.</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And I think you also referred to a matter in Swaziland in 1984.</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> Yes, that's correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Thank you, Mr Malan.  So you did appreciate the question.  You knew what the question was about.  The question was about illegal acts that you performed in your fight against the ANC.  Not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> I ask you again, where did you get the idea from that you could employ illegal methods when fighting the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> I received the order to do so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> So are you telling this Honourable Committee that whenever you employed illegal methods in your fight against the ANC, it was on instructions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Instructions from your seniors?</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> And in particular Maj Deetlefs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Why are you hesitating?</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> The order was from Piet Retief and Vlakplaas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Is your case, Mr van Zweel, that in all the illegal activities in which you engaged, you were simply following instructions?  You were following orders?</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> And that went to the extent where you had to lie and commit perjury, were you still following instructions then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> Yes, the perjury was upon instruction.  It was upon instructions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> So when you made that statement under oath in anticipation of inquest proceedings arising out of the events of the 12th June 1988, you were following instructions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> Yes, I've already told the Committee that it was a false statement, or that at least aspects of the statement were false.</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Yes.  And is it correct that the lying there, the following of instructions there was a concerted effort on the part of your seniors?  By that I mean that not only you, but other persons in a lower rank, had to toe the line and tell the same lie?</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> Yes, all of us told the lie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Yes, but it was something that was organised by your seniors, that you should lie?</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Now with regard to...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Sorry, Mr Moerane, if I may, on this point. The preparation of the statements, did you ever have any interviews with Pienaar, or did he prepare the statement and give it to you to sign?</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> I don't believe that this statement was taken by Mr Pienaar.  I cannot see who took that statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> The question is whether you were interviewed?  The statement was made under oath, can you recall whether any interview was held with you regarding this statement or were you simply given the statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> The statement was written, I was given the statement to read and I signed it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Was the statement taken from you, in other words in your presence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Are you sure of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> I'm almost 100% certain of that.  I cannot recall precisely, it's quite a long time ago, but I am almost certain of it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Sorry, Mr Moerane, if I may just proceed on this point.  Were all of you called in to agree on a version or how did it come to be that everybody could lie about exactly the same thing in this statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> I can no longer recall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Isn't it probable that somebody compiled these statements for everybody and gave it to them to sign?</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> That is possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> It doesn't seem to me that there is any other possibility.</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> I cannot say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And you cannot recall who presented the statement to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr Pienaar gave evidence that he was the investigating officer.  Isn't it probable that it was he who compiled it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> That is possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> The investigating officer of that intended inquest was W/O Pienaar.</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Yes.  Now coming to the statement that you made in connection with your amnesty application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> You made that statement on the 13th December 1996 at Delmas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Would I be correct in saying that, present at the same place and the same time, was W/O Pienaar?</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> And also Mr Theron?</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> And Mr Hayes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> I cannot recall.  I don't believe that Mr Hayes was there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> I think you should consult the documents Mr Moerane because that is not correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> I beg your pardon, Mr Chairman, that is correct.  The statement of Mr Hayes was completed in Pietermaritzburg on the 13th December, I beg your pardon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a>The statement of Mr Deetlefs was completed in Delmas on the same day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Tell me, how did it come about that all of you were at Delmas, those that I've mentioned and those that you have confirmed, were at Delmas on the same day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> We were consulting with our Advocates, person to person, in Delmas.  I'd already left the force.  Somebody took me there.  I cannot recall who the person was that took me there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> When did you leave the force?</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> 1992.</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> I see.  As far as the attesting of the affidavit that you made on the 13th December 1996 is concerned, how did that come about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> It took place in Delmas in Mr Prinsloo's offices.</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> And did you know that the affidavit that you made was in identical words with that made by the other people I have mentioned?  Pienaar, Hayes, Barnard, Theron and others too who were not there, Rorich and Deetlefs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> I haven't read any one of the statements made by any of the other persons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That's not quite correct that it's identical words.  If you look for instance at page 271 in the fifth paragraph,</p>

<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Or am I mistaken about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Compared with what, Mr Prinsloo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I'm sorry, I made a mistake there, Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, it's also a question for argument.</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> In any event it's exactly the same, page 117, identical and it's the same paragraph.  They all consist of six paragraphs and each paragraph is exactly the same.  The only difference, as I've pointed out, are the names.  Obviously the person can't say that so-and-so, for instance you couldn't say van Zweel, you say myself, and then you mention the others.</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Mr Chairman, is the suggestion, with respect, that these statements ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We seem to go through this with each and every witness.  I think we can leave it for argument.  We know, it's been pointed out that they are the same, except for that one aspect which is different.  We know that they were taken all at Delmas on the same day.  I think it's fair that you ask how it happened that they got there the same day, but I think we can deal with this in argument, if you want to raise it in argument.</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> That is so, I will raise it in argument, but I think in fairness, I have to put it to each of the witnesses, particularly, Mr Chairman, in the light of the statements that were prepared for the inquest, I do not want to be accused of not having put it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, I'm not disallowing the questions, I'm just saying that each time we get the objections and there's the same interjections, we're just losing time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> I beg your pardon, these are my clients who are also being implicated.  This is my greatest problem.  I know it is not my client and it is not my turn to speak, but as a result of the insinuations which Mr Moerane is making, especially with regard to what he has just said, that the statements were all taken by Mr Pienaar for the post mortem inquest, Mr Moerane is now alleging that the legal representatives, as both witnesses have just given evidence, the incident was set out to indicate that there was dishonesty on behalf of the legal representatives and I would like to object to that because the same sort of point has been put to the Committee before and his Honourable Justice Wilson has stated beforehand that everybody knows how legal representatives compile statements.  We have technology available to us in the form of a computer and if the form of the document is universal, why should that be a problem?  If there is a measure of dishonesty, then Mr Moerane must put it as such.  I request that this be the case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, I don't know what Mr Moerane is going to argue, but I must say that this form of application when there are several applicants and there is very similar wording, is very common, not only with regard to Security Force personnel but with regard to other applicants as well.  I've come across it quite often that there's the same wording used, the same political motivation keeps coming over and over again in different applications from different people.  But I don't know what the point Mr Moerane is going to be arguing and I don't know if there is any insinuation that the legal practitioners were part of a conspiracy to make the same story, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Mr Chairman, anyone who has been present here will know that I have made no insinuations against the legal representatives.  I am concerned with the applicants themselves and their credibility.</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think we have wasted quite a lot of time on this point about this.  If we can move on now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr Moerane, with your permission.  May I just determine from you, Mr van Zweel, when you made your application did Mr Pienaar or anybody else contact you to tell you about everybody who was involved in this matter and who had to apply for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> I had already left the force, I cannot recall.  I think that a person from Ermelo, if I recall correctly, a Maj Marais, took me to Delmas in order to make my statement, but I am not certain.</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You cannot recall that Mr Pienaar contacted you or Mr Deetlefs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> No, I did not travel with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And this Mr Marais, or whatever his name was, did he simply get to you himself and tell you to apply for amnesty for this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> Yes, he told me that the Generals had decided, or that this was the decision that came from Head Office, I cannot recall exactly, that we should apply for amnesty and all of us should go to Delmas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And then you made a statement to your legal representatives there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And you then signed it on a different day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> No, it was signed on that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> On the very same day that you made the statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Thank you, I am indebted, Mr Malan.  So in short, Mr van Zweel, you were requested to make an application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> And you came up to Delmas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> You had this consultation and you signed the affidavit and you went back?</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Yes.  Now, let's come to the incident itself.  Do you recall what you were told when you were invited by Mr Deetlefs to come and join him, to come to Piet Retief?  What did he say to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> He picked me up at Ermelo and I went with him to Piet Retief.  In the office I was present for a while when the matter was discussed and from there we went to the scene.</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr van Zweel, the question is, can you recall what Mr Deetlefs said to you before he picked you up and why he came to pick you up, the reason why he came to pick you up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> He said we were going to Piet Retief.  He said that there were people infiltrating from Swaziland and that we had to go and assist.</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Yes, and when you got to Piet Retief there was a briefing session, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> What was said to you about the operation?  What was going to happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> That there would be a vehicle coming from Swaziland containing MK members and that at a certain point on the Houtkop road we would take up position and wait for the people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Yes, continue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> That transpired later.</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Moerane wants to know what you were told at the briefing session.  You said that you were told that there was going to be infiltration, people would be coming in a vehicle, you'd take up position at a spot.  Was there anything else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> That the people would be armed and that the planning was of such a nature that they would give us a signal should the people be armed, the indicator light would flicker and we reacted upon that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> How were you to react to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> That if Manzini climbed out and ran, we had to open fire on the vehicle and we did that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> I see.  So you knew that there was going to be an ambush?</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> And you were prepared to go along with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Had you heard that there was an incident four days before that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> Yes, I heard about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> And had you heard that four ANC members had been killed in that incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Had you heard that that incident had taken place at the same spot where you were to lie in wait?</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> And had you heard that the first group, the group that came through on the 8th of June, had not been armed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> No, I never knew that.  I heard about that the other day here.  I never knew about it until the day upon which evidence was given about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> What information did you have?</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> Simply that the people had been armed and that they had been killed.  I never had any information that they were not armed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> And had you been told that the people in the first incident, that's the incident of the 8th June, had shot at the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> I can no longer recall what the precise information was, I just recall hearing that people had been shot dead.</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MOERANE</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Sorry Chair, just before you proceed to Ms Lockhat.  Mr van Zweel the question was put to you whether you had knowledge of the first incident, but the time of your knowledge was never specifically mentioned.  Just to have certainty, I assume that you understand that this has to do with your knowledge of the first incident before the second incident took place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> Yes, I heard about the first incident before the second incident took place, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ms Lockhat?</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOCKHAT:</span> I have no questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a>NO CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS LOCKHAT</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Adv Gcabashe any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Yes, thank you Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, before - yes, re-examination, sorry Mr Prinsloo, I forgot.  Do you have any re-examination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Briefly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">RE-EXAMINATION BY MR PRINSLOO:</span> Mr van Zweel when you executed orders, did you believe that you were acting in the interests of your country in the execution of your duties?</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Thank you, no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR PRINSLOO</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Adv Gcabashe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Mr van Zweel in the statement you made, the one in volume 5, that was used at the inquest, paragraph 8 thereof, you talk about the man coming out of the kombi and that you heard shots from the direction of the kombi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Is there any reason why you did not mention the fact that a bullet actually hit the surface of the tar between yourself and Rorich as you were approaching the vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> I don't know why I never mentioned it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> But the statement itself was prepared by you or by Mr Pienaar, just help me again with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> I cannot say who took the statement because I cannot make out who signed at the bottom.</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, but I think what Adv Gcabashe wants confirmed is whether you provided the taker of the statement, the person who had this statement typed out, with the contents contained there or if you were just presented with a written statement for you to sign.</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> Chairperson, I think I have already stated that I cannot recall how it took place, because this statement was taken quite a while afterwards.  In all honesty I cannot tell you whether the statement had already been prepared or whether I was there when the statement was taken, I really cannot recall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> But you would agree that mentioning the fact that the bullet struck the tar would have strengthened your version as presented at the inquest?</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> One other matter.  Do you know how the deceased got to be shot in the head?</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> No, I cannot say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Do you remember directing shots at any one of the four specifically in the region of the head and neck?</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> I shot into the back section of the kombi, I don't know where my bullets hit, whether they hit any of the deceased, it is very difficult for me to say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Thank you.  Thank you Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Malan.</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr van Zweel, I did not put this to any of the other applicants, but this is something which remains strange to me and that is that you find the people there with their weapons ready to fire and the evidence is that they told the driver not to be afraid, that they would protect him, that everything was fine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> The only way that I can assist you with that is that everything happened very quickly and that the people didn't have a chance to fire back.  I really cannot tell you why they didn't fire any shots.  What the circumstances were inside the kombi is very difficult for me to say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Weren't those guns planted on them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> No, never.</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you given the opportunity to volunteer for this operation or were you just instructed to go along?</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> I was given instruction to accompany, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You see, I ask because Mr Deetlefs said that Sgt Manzini was a - volunteered for it.  I was just wondering whether that applied to anybody else in the operation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> Chairperson, one could probably refuse, I don't know, but I don't think one could refuse if you worked for the state.   If you receive instructions you must execute those instructions.  I don't believe one could refuse.  It is in the interests of the country and in the interest of the South African Police, so I believe that the instructions which I executed were justified.</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Any questions arising from questions put by members of the panel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">FURTHER CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MOERANE:</span> Mr Chairman yes.  It might not arise directly but it relates to the</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a>firing by this person and the reconstruction about a year later.  Mr van Zweel you told the Honourable Committee, that you attended a reconstruction of this event at a later stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> Yes, that is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> And I assume that at that reconstruction each one of the people who fired stood at a position where he alleged he was at the time of the shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> Yes, that is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Now was Col de Kock at that reconstruction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> I don't know Chairperson, it was a long time ago.  Is it not in the report?  I cannot recall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> All you say is that on the 24th May 1989,</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a>"I was present at the scene when the scene was reconstructed and I indicated the place from where I fired shots."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> So you do not recall whether Col de Kock was there or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> I cannot recall who were all there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> In all probability he wasn't there because at that stage he was being kept out of this matter, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> That is possible, yes, Chairperson, because he was kept out of the matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> You say even on that occasion, or on that occasion you saw a mark on the tar which you believed was caused by a bullet from the firearm that was fired by this person who came out of the kombi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> Yes, that's what I said, Chairperson, but I also said that it could have been one of the other - the advocate asked me and I said it could have been a bullet that might have ricocheted from somewhere or somebody else's bullet, I did not deny it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> I see.  So you are actually saying that you are not positive that that mark was caused by that bullet?</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> I am positive that the mark was caused by a bullet but I am not positive that it was caused by the bullet of an ANC member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> I suggest to you that this question of the person from the kombi firing, is something that you people fabricated for purposes of the inquest.</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> No, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> You didn't see him fire.</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN ZWEEL:</span> Chairperson, I say I suspected that the person who had jumped out the left front of the vehicle fired in our direction and you asked that it could have been another bullet and I said, "yes it is possible."</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Yes, but what I'm putting to you is that you did not see this person fire.</p>
