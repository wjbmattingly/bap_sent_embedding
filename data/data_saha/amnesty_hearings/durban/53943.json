Mrs Ferrero was killed on instructions by the leader on that day, Mr Mduduzi.  The murder was not a part of their plan from the outset, but in such situations panic and the ingraining of having to follow orders from comrades and people superior to you in the cause was what my client did when he killed Mrs Ferrero.  He had the choice, it was either to kill her or be killed.  What was his option?  He obtained firearms and pump guns and the purpose of the attack as I said was purely political but certainly innocent people getting injured, maimed, killed as it happened on that day.\n\tHis remorse has been expressed.  The mens rea for murder has not been ascertained but to obtain firearms.  He been honest in answering his questions to the best of his ability and he volunteers to implicate his co-perpetrators as best as he can.  His intention today is for the truth and full disclosure and hopeful reconciliation and in the light of the above I ask that the Honourable Members of this Committee consider my client's application for amnesty.

Mr Chairperson, Committee Members, audience, all I wish to submit at this stage is that can we really believe what the applicant has said us today?\nIn his bail application previously he said that he was nowhere in the vicinity of the farm.  Can we really trust what he says today?  In his trial in the Supreme Court he actually said that he was not guilty, he put in a plea of not guilty.  Can we really trust what he is saying? \n\tThe victims, as evidence was led, were old feeble people.  There was no reason for killing those two victims.  Evidence was also led that these people were feeble in that they could easily been taken advantage of.  \n\tIf we ought to go back to the sentence that the Honourable Justice Hugo delivered, it relates in the sentence that there could have only been one motive for these killings and that was of greed.  As evidence was led by Mrs Julia Ferrero that the family was relatively wealthy, this lies in support to that evidence. \n\tHe couldn't prove to this court that he really was a member of the ANC.  He couldn't show this court any documentary proof.  He didn't bring any witnesses to testify on his behalf that what he was really telling this court was the truth.
