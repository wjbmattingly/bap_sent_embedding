I still feel very sad, even today.\n\tI do realise that within our own political organisation, we do not know how to conduct ourselves, we lacked proper leaders who had to guide us and tell us as to how we should exercise political tolerance.  So at some stage we acted in a manner that could be regarded as purely criminal of which we regret.  I personally do regret it now.
