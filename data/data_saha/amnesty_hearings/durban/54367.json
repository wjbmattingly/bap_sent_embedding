Just before we start with the evidence this morning, I would just like to rectify something that I should have done yesterday and that is namely to identify exhibits.  I think the video for instance that we watched, should be an exhibit, that is an exhibit, Exhibit 6.  Is it Exhibit 7, thank you Ms Thabethe?\n\tThe video will be Exhibit 7 and then Prof Vanezis' report, that is the two-page report that accompanied the video, that will be Exhibit M.  That is the two-page report done by Dr Vanezis and then I think we ought to also have that article by Shahrom, the one that was used and referred to, which we had in our possession and which was sent to us by Prof Vanezis, that is that article on facial reconstruction, Shahrom et al, computer aided facial reconstruction, that article, that article, that article will be Exhibit N.\n\tI notice that, and I think we are all in the same position, that the copy that we have, starts with page 2.  Is there a page 1, does anyone have a page 1 to the article, because it is also clear that page 1 is missing, it starts with the figure 2, there is no figure 1 on it?  The first page of the fax is missing, I think we are all in the same position, is that so, no one has got anything ...\n\tMs Thabethe, if you can just make enquiries about that, I don't think it is vital, but in any event.  We are also given a photograph of Ms Ntombi Kubheka, a photograph of her sitting on a bed.  That photograph will be, that photocopy of the photograph will be Exhibit O.",

In this instance, all three the dresses have got elasticised waists and were styled accordingly which makes it very difficult, although the measurement we have given is of the actual garment size, you cannot pin-point exactly what the waist measurement in fact would have been, because of it is not darted, there is a variable.",

The other thing, the across bust measure which is really from the shoulders to the waist, pointed out to me that the person didn't have a very long torso, in fact, what we call short-waisted.\n\tThat measurement was also not dramatically different.

With clothing, in the factories, and I have worked in the industry as well, sizing as such is so variable, it depends on the styling.  From one label to the other, it could change.

There could be shrinkage and with the warpage, you are losing some.  I think there you could add on 2cm or 3cm.  You cannot pin-point that belt accurately.

If it a sort of below the knee and a little bit down, and it is not major.  I think one of the crucial things is the waist measure, the actual waist measure which is more or less the same, and the bust measure, I think those are the two really important measurements in clothing, and that is what would, you know would really make me thing that definitely this is, and the fact that the styling of the clothes.\n\tI mean people that generally are maybe a little bit overweight or that, prefer styles like this, with the elasticised waist, because it is more comfortable like that.
