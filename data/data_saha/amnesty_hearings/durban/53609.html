<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, the next witness is Maj du Preez.  His statement of his evidence also appears in the additional bundle and I would refer you to page 41 of that additional bundle, Mr Chairman.  Du Preez is present and he will give his evidence in Afrikaans.  He has no objection to taking the prescribed oath.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">S G DU PREEZ:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you say page 41 of bundle B?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Of the original bundle, and page, I'm sorry, of the additional bundle and page 10 of the original bundle, Mr Chairperson.  In the original bundle his amnesty application, he deals with the Tekere matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, I've got that, thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR VISSER:</span> At page 12, I think it is.  Mr du Preez, you are also an applicant in the amnesty application with regard to the death of Mr Tekere?</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That's correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Do you have  -  have you studied Exhibit A and read through it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That's correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Are there any parts of Exhibit A which are not applicable to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> The parts with regard to Lesotho and Botswana.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And with regard to the remaining parts of Exhibit A, was this on the grounds of your own knowledge and on the grounds of reports that were sent to you and your general knowledge?  Can you confirm those parts?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that's correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And you ask that these be considered in the consideration of your application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That's correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You have previously given evidence in the Ndwandwe matter and the so-called kwaMashu 3 which was Ntjale Villakase and Sibusiso?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That's correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> As well as Mr Pumezo Mcubini?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That's correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr du Preez on page 42 of the additional bundle, you have said that your memory is quite vague and in the introduction you said that these events took place over a long period and you were involved with several instances and there are no documents which you can refresh your memory by and base your memory on, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That's correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And in your original application indeed you have said that the incident as to which you will give evidence, excuse me we will repeat that, but with regard to your application you said that you could not recall anything at that stage with regard to this incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> It is more that I was confused with all the events.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, that is what I wanted to ask you.  At that stage you were not certain as to which facts fitted in with which events?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And you require that your evidence be elaborated by means of a document which was handed in.  Can you please proceed with paragraph 3 on page 42, the additional bundle.  Oh excuse me, maybe I should just ask you beforehand, during this incident you were stationed at Durban, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That's correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Who was your Commanding Officer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> If I recall correctly, it was Botha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And that is what you said the previous time when you gave evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And which Commander was above him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> It was Col Taylor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What was your rank, Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I think I was a Lieutenant or a Captain at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And you are currently a Major?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> With which you retired from the Force?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That's correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Please continue from paragraph 2.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I think I will start at paragraph 3, we've already dealt with paragraph 2.  It was arranged that Wasserman and I, ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Please excuse me, will you please start at paragraph 2?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I am only able to recall certain matters in this incident and I recall that Col Taylor called me on one day and requested me to go to a farm in the Elandskop area with W/O Wasserman.  This farm, according to my knowledge, was used as a safe-house by Col Vorster.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a>	It was arranged that Wasserman and I would meet Vorster in Pietermaritzburg and we followed him in our vehicle to the farm, where we arrived at dusk.  On the farm we met Col Taylor and a black man.  While the black man was left behind in the house, Col Taylor told Vorster, Wasserman and myself certain information outside the house.  As far as I can recall, the information was to the effect that the man, Tekere was a trained terrorist and that he was a member of the ANC's Special Operations Unit.  He was arrested while he was on his way to place an explosive device in the Durban area.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a>	Col Taylor also informed us that he tried to recruit Tekere, but that he was not successful.  Taylor was of the opinion that he could not release Tekere because he would disclose the identity of askaris to the ANC and that he would continue with his terrorist activities.  He also did not have any evidence which he could use to have Tekere prosecuted.  Col Taylor informed us that he consequently decided that Tekere had to be eliminated and he ordered Wasserman and I to carry out this order.  From this information it became clear that Tekere was abducted and was detained unlawfully.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a>	On the grounds of the following actions I associated myself with this.  Vorster indicated a place to us in a plantation of pine trees close to the road which led to the garage.  Wasserman and I dug a grave there with the spades which Vorster supplied to us.  When we were done, we returned to the house where Tekere was informed that he would be moved to another place and he was blindfolded.  I think Tekere was cuffed all the time, with his hands behind his back.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a>	Wasserman and I walked Tekere down the road and at some point close to the grave, Wasserman hit Tekere over the head with a baton and he fell unconscious.  After he fell on the ground, Wasserman shot him in the head and chest with a silenced Makarov pistol.  We removed Tekere's clothing, placed him in the grave and closed the grave.  Afterwards we went back to the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a>	The clothing of Tekere was burned right there on the farm, if I recall correctly, a fire was made outside the house.  Afterwards we returned back to Durban.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And you say that the actions and omissions which were committed by you, were done in the execution of your official duty and you acted here in the instruction of a senior officer, whose instructions you were obliged to execute and this was in the opposition of the struggle to protect the government and the National Party's interest and to combat the revolutionary onslaught and you bona fide believed that you acted within your implicit or expressive authority?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You know there's a limit to way questions are put.  You know, you don't make a statement to him, you put a question him.  We've reached so far in this matter that at this stage that it can't prejudice anybody.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, I thought so Mr Chairman, but if you feel that I should lead it to the witness to say it out of his own each time, then I will gladly do so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, but I think that as far as crucial aspects of the evidence are concerned, let that come out of his own mouth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, of course.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Rather than him saying yes or no, if you don't mind.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  Chairperson, do I understand you correctly to say that I can go a bit quicker over the issues pertaining to the past as I've just done?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, quite right, there's nothing wrong with that.  We can understand because there has been a great deal of evidence that's already been led.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, I thought so, Chairperson, with respect, but as far as his evidence on the facts is concerned, I'd rather let him tell you that out of his own.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Quite right, for example the precise extent of his participation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Must come from him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, certainly, Chairperson.  Thank you, Chairperson.  If I may turn to page 41 Chairperson, we again refer to the question of the abduction.  In our minds we're not entirely certain what the legal position is of a man who finds somebody and he comes to the conclusion in his own mind that the man must have been abducted and he associates himself with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, I don't know whether one can go to that extent.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well technically it might be argued by the Attorney-General that he therefore became associo criminus in the abduction itself.  We're not entirely certain what the legal position might be but perhaps ex abundanti cautela, Chairperson, we should ask you to consider A on page 41 in the case of Vorster as well as this witness and Mr Wasserman, for what it might be worth, but clearly they realised that he was not in legal detention and therefore B would be relevant, C would also be relevant, as well as any other delict or offence committed and as shown by the facts.  Mr Chairman, we notice it is now 5 past 11, we're not certain whether you want to take the tea adjournment now or continue with the next witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We'd like to dispose of this witness's evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Certainly, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR VISSER</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Nel, any questions you wish to put?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> I've got no questions, thank you Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a>NO QUESTIONS BY MR NEL</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ms Thabethe, any cross-examination of this witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Thank you, Mr Chair, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS THABETHE:</span> In your evidence Mr du Preez, you have indicated that Col Taylor informed you, Vorster and Wasserman outside about the deceased, M K Tekere, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> And you've also indicated that he informed you that he was called whilst on his way to place a bomb, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Did he inform you whether he did find anything with him?  Was he in possession of those bombs, or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> No, I cannot recall.  I understood it that he was active in Durban with the execution of operations of placing bombs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> No, what I'm trying to understand is, was he caught whilst he was on his way to place bombs?  Was that what you were told or, I'm just trying to understand that feature of the evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That's correct, but I cannot recall whether he was specifically on his way with explosives in his possession.  I cannot recall if Taylor told me that he had explosives in his possession at the time of his arrest.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> And were you involved in any way in the interrogation of Mr Tekere?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> No, not at all.  I met Taylor at the farm there with him.  I never interrogated Tekere.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Thank you Mr Chair, no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS THABETHE</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Mr du Preez, do you have any idea when Taylor had arrested Tekere, or whether in fact Taylor himself even arrested Tekere?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I have no idea.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And your recollection is that it was the three of you that were told by Taylor about this man together, you were all present together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Now and your recollection of what you were told is as it's contained here and as you've testified?  That this man was arrested on his way to place certain bombs, that's how you've put it in these - is that your recollection?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That's correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You see, what concerns me is that if a man was arrested on his way to place bombs, he'd presumably have the bombs with him that he was intending to place, there would presumably consequently therefore be some evidence upon which you could then charge him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That's correct.  At that stage I cannot recall whether Taylor told me that he found explosives in his possession, or I never saw any of those explosives, or I've never heard of the circumstances surrounding these explosives.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You see, I'm just trying to put myself in your position on that day, being told that information and what would not have made sense would have then been the statement, well there was no evidence to charge him.  You don't recall having questioned that or being uncomfortable with that in any way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> No, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Thank you, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In other words what it really boils down to here is that you were told by Taylor that this man was about to place bombs in Durban.  That ought to have conveyed to you that this man was - had either committed an offence for being in possession of explosives, or was planning to commit an offence.  He could be arrested and he could be charged.  Now, if that were so, then your evidence that you couldn't release this man because there was no case against him, you couldn't make a case against him, presents me with some difficult, because there would be a case against him if he was found in possession of explosives, or he was caught while he was about to place a bomb somewhere in Durban.  Now I understand your position.  As far as you are concerned, your recollection is that this is what you were told and you didn't question it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Correct, Chairperson, maybe I should answer in the following.  I had the fullest confidence in Col Taylor and if he said that the man had to be eliminated, I had the fullest confidence that there was no other way and if there were alternatives to charge the man, he would have done so or he would have used that option.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you.  Have you any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Mr du Preez, the same point which was raised by my colleagues is my problem as well.  On page 43 you say there he was arrested while he was on his way to place an explosive device in Durban.  You do not qualify it as saying that he was unlawfully arrested and then later you say, because of the information that he was, you know that he was abducted and unlawfully detained.  Are you not uncomfortable with this where you say he was arrested and then later you said that he was abducted, which contradicts arrest, are you not uncomfortable with this now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> With regard to the arrest, at the time of his arrest I don't know whether it was an arrest or an abduction.  When I found the man at the farm and Taylor gave us the instruction to eliminate him, it was clear that it was an abduction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> But now ex post facto you say that he was arrested, why don't you say that he was abducted while he was on his way to place the explosive device?  This is what bothers me because in this written statement you contradict yourself.  Shall I put it to you, did you initially think that he was arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I assumed that Taylor must have arrested the man and later this arrest turned into an abduction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Why did you not say in your statement that he was abducted?  Why did you say he was arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> It might just be a choice of words.  When a policeman says that when a person is taken, he is arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> But you were a senior policeman and you retired with a senior rank from the police force, for a policeman there must be a great difference between arrest and abduction?  Thank you.  Thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Any re-examination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, please, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">RE-EXAMINATION BY MR VISSER:</span> For you as a policeman, was there a difference between a lawful and an unlawful arrest?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> An unlawful arrest and an abduction, what is the difference between the two?</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> I would say unlawful arrest would be abduction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR VISSER</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Any questions you wish to put arising out of all of this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> No, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a>NO FURTHER CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS THABETHE</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a>We'll take the short adjournment at this stage and resume in 15 minutes.</p>

<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes Mr Visser?</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, in the adjournment Mr Nel indicated to us that he would ask you to allow him to ask some questions which he hadn't put to the witness, du Preez.  Du Preez is still present and he's still under his former oath.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">S G DU PREEZ:</span> (s.u.o)</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, please do proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR NEL:</span> Mr du Preez, what I would like to do is to put to you Col Taylor's role with regard to his work and also with regard to the persons under his command, just to clear it up for the Committee's sake.  To begin with, when did you arrive at the Security Branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> 1979, that is when I began at the Security Branch in Durban.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> And when you arrived there was Col Taylor already at the branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, for quite some time.  I suspect that it may have been from approximately 1973 or 1975.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Am I correct in saying that initially you did not serve under him, but from your arrival he was already in control of the terrorism unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> And for how long did you serve under his command in the same section?</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Since 1980 or 81, I began working under his command.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> And Col Taylor was, up to his discharge as medically unfit, in control of the terrorism unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> In approximately 1990 or 1991, we went to Head Office in Durban and that is where we resided.  Taylor was still involved with the askaris, but in 1990 or 1991 we went to Durban.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I didn't, it seemed a bit disjointed to me.  What happened in 1990, 1991?</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is when I went to the Regional Office in Durban, I was transferred there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I see.  In other words you met Taylor for the first time once you came to Durban in 1990, 1991?</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> No, 1979.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> 1979?</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Now, during this period before you went to Head Office and worked directly under his command, who was the bearer of dossiers and the Chief Investigator of that section?</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> It was Col Taylor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> And what was the role of the other members under his command?  Did you also carry files, or what was your task?</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> We were field workers and we also assisted with investigations or rumours.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> May I just interrupt at this stage?  May I ask you, what is the purpose of all this questioning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Mr Chairman, I just wanted to enlighten the Committee as to what sort of a person Mr Taylor was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I don't think I'm going to allow that.  We are concerned with the amnesty application by people who have applied before us.  We are not going to pass judgment on Mr Taylor, we're not going to make an assessment on Mr Taylor's achievements or demerits.  Do you understand?</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> I understand, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We've got to confine ourselves to the applicants for amnesty and what they did.  We have accepted the information placed before us, that they all accepted orders from Col Taylor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman, I was merely trying to try and enlighten the acceptance of an order from for instance Mr du Preez from Col Taylor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We accept that, you see.  We haven't questioned anybody when they said that they'd accepted instructions from Col Taylor because of his seniority and we have accepted that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Very well then, thank you Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Your questioning of this witness doesn't go beyond just trying to establish?</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> No, it does not, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Alright, thank you.  Well then you're excused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR DU PREEZ:</span> Thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
