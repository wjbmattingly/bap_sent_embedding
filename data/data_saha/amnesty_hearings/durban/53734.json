            "Thank you Chairperson.  Where we left off yesterday evening, there were a number of matters outstanding.  The first was the status of a Section 29 record, the other was the issue of statistics as derived from various sources and the third point was the material from what I could say, various archives.   With regard to the statistics, I am waiting for various reports from Pretoria and elsewhere and I will leave that point until I get them.   Archival material, I thank Mr Dehal for making available what he has, unfortunately there are no indexes and keys to the various photographs extant any more, but I will deal with that as best I can as we go, I regret to say I haven't read 21 volumes of the various appeal records overnight.   Then, I then proceed to the status of the Section 29 record.    I believe what can be the starting point is the matter that is common cause, that Volume C is the product of information gained on cross-examination via the provisions and mechanisms provided for in Section 29.  I don't believe I need to address further.   The only factual matter that I may deal with there is I make the comment, but it doesn't prepare that a prepared statement was handed in, unless it is not part of the bundle, but that does not affect the argument.   Once Section 29 governs the matter, reference needs be made to Section 29(5) firstly, which provides to paraphrase that information and matter to put it loosely obtained in such a hearing, shall not be made public until the Commission determines otherwise, or in the absence of such a determination, until the article is produced at a hearing in terms of this Act, and then it proceeds, or at any proceedings in any court.   Section 29(5), this document has been produced, and therefore it has been made public.   The fact that it is correctly in our hands, I believe flows automatically from that Section.  As to what use it can be put to, reference then need be made to Section 31(3).  There, (3) provides that any incriminating answer or information obtained or incriminating evidence directly or indirectly derived from a questioning in terms of (1, shall not be and now I stress, admissible as evidence, against the person concerned in any criminal proceedings in a court of law, or before anybody or institution established under any law.   The operative concepts underlying that section are firstly, shall not be admissible as evidence for what purpose I add, against the person.  Now, in these hearings, what use Exhibit C is being put to, is I am not seeking to admit it as evidence, I am seeking to use it as cross-examination.  Clearly Section 31(3) has no application, it certainly does not bar me from using it for the purposes of cross-examination.   If it was the intention to prohibit that use of the record, which is now a public document, it was incumbent on the legislature so to say, the Section is completely silent and therefore it can only be assumed that if that were intended to be prohibited, as it doesn't say so, it is perfectly admissible.  Then the next leg, is the argument regarding privilege.  Now, my submission is that no privilege at all attaches to the documents and in that sense, it is certainly not privileged in the law of evidence sense.  What (4) of Section 31 states is that the law of privilege is and the attendant writes associated with the concept available to a witness giving evidence before an inquiry in terms of the Section.   In other words, if information has been imparted in a privileged circumstance such as communication between a legal advisor and the witness, that communication would be privileged and as is per the law of privilege, a right which the witness can claim if so wished during the course of the questioning.   If one looks at the language of the Section, I will read\n\"... subject to the provisions of this Section, the law regarding privilege, as applicable to a witness summoned to give evidence in a criminal case in a court of law, shall apply in relation to the questioning of a person in terms of (1).\"\n\tNo reference again is made to the results of the questioning and for that subsection to be interpreted to mean that the evidence given is privileged in any way whatsoever, I cannot see any device whereby the meaning, the plain meaning of that section could be contorted to have that import, so my argument this morning is that the point of privilege is completely relevant.   To sum up, I can find nothing in the various Sections which prohibits me from using this Section 29 inquiries for the purposes of cross-examination.  The content of the Section 29 may or may not be admissible as evidence, but that doesn't affect my rights to cross-examination, to use it as a subject matter on which to cross-examine.  The two are completely  separate and distinct concepts.   My request and my application is that I be permitted to proceed as and when appropriate to use the document for the purposes of cross-examination, thank you Chairperson.  Thank you Committee.",

Chairperson, I submit that that begs the question - the documents are only public I would submit when this Committee rules that they can be used, until such time, the documents are not public and cannot be used.   The second point my learned friend argues that Section 31(3) provides that - well, it only prohibits incriminating evidence being elicited from a witness.   My learned friend says that he does not intend to use the answers as evidence, he does not intend to illicit incriminating evidence, if that is so, then for what purpose does he intend to use the answers?  It can only be for evidence and if that evidence is incriminating against the person who made the statement, in this case it would be Mr McBride, I am not suggesting that the answers are incriminating, but as a legal principle, my learned friend's submissions cannot be correct.",

He says that the Section allows a person to be questioned.  In my submission, my learned friend's argument begs the question, the question is whether the Section 29 evidence was tendered without prejudice.  If the Section 29 evidence was tendered without prejudice, then it is privileged and then the Law of Privilege applies, so we go back to the starting point, what was the purpose of a Section 29 hearing?  We know that the Act is clear, the hearing is in camera and it is secret, for a certain period.  Does that mean, and that is I submit the question that the Committee must decide, does that mean that that evidence is tendered without prejudice?  If it doesn't mean that, then the Law of Privilege does not apply.  If that evidence was tendered without prejudice, then the question is has the witness waived that privilege, which attaches to the communication.  My submission is this committee will have to rule, with respect, on what was the status of the evidence when it was tendered at the Section 29 hearing.",

            "Thank you Mr Chairperson.  Mr Chairperson, as I understood the argument yesterday, the inquiry appeared to fall outside the purview of what is today being discussed. Yesterday my learned colleague, the Evidence Leader, premised his argument on the basis that Mr McBride referred to his 29 proceedings in his application for amnesty, and that is the reason why he caused those copies of the evidence to be included in the bundle before us.  Now I think he is acting in good faith, I see reason for him to have acted so, I have no argument against him, but wrongly, he has acted wrongly.  Surely, not in bad faith.   In so far as Mr Richard is concerned, I understood his argument as being premised on privilege and so he went about Hoffman and privilege and the document falling in his lap and hence the privilege waived.   I see today that the argument deals principally with the Act and the legal submissions, I will deal with them all briefly.  I think it would be important to deal with yesterday's submissions for the inquiry I submit respectfully, is  wider.   My submissions are that one must have regard to the application for amnesty by Mr McBride and the reference therein to the, albeit ambiguous terminology relative to the evidence in the 29 hearings.  May I take you Mr Chairperson and Honourable Members to page 103 of bundle A1 and ending at page 112, that is the application for amnesty by Mr McBride, page 103 onwards.  Mr Chairperson, you will notice that this firstly is an application for amnesty by Mr McBride himself, this is an application formulated not on the roneod form, but on a form that has been captured onto Mr Currin's computers, to keep the roneo'd format the same, but to fill in details.  What is important is not that, but this.  Mr Chairperson, you would look at page 104 and paragraph 9(a) which deals with the acts itself.  In dealing with the acts and various counts for which amnesty is being sought, no reference is made to any aspect relative to the 29 proceedings.  He refers to it only under paragraph (b) on page 106, but of course it is referred to on the following page, page 107.  It is important to understand this document and the reference to the 29's aspects, not the proceedings but aspects, within that context.   9(b) deals not with the acts, but purely with the injuries and deaths resulting from the above.  (i), (ii) on page 106 and on page 107 (iii).  (iii) Mr Chairperson and Honourable Members, deal with the following - principally the car bomb operation at Why Not bar and in particular confined to a list of the persons who were injured or killed as a result of that operation.  Now to obviate the need to type out a list of those names or injured and deceased persons, Mr McBride seeks to refer in the first place to the trial record and charge sheet and then to the application and look at those words specifically, he says in parenthesis \"further details are contained in the application handed in to the Commission in Durban at Section 29 hearing\", he does not say look at my evidence.",

More importantly Mr Chairperson, it refers also to during the 29 proceedings, there were certain subpoenas served on my client, Mr McBride and also on Ms Apelgren, both of whom presented themselves at the 29 hearings and certain documents that were dealt with during the 29 hearings, which were looked at before the hearings began and which dealt with the list of names alone.  Support for that submission can be found in a correct logistic reading of this application for amnesty and as earlier submitted, the acts are dealt with earlier in paragraphs (a).  There is no reference under that Act to the evidence under the 29 proceedings, and surely if one had regard to the 29 proceedings and the evidence, it would be prudent, advisable, astute, correct to refer to those submissions and evidence under 9(a) and not under 9(b), which simply requires a detailed recording of the names of the persons injured.  Just one further submission Mr Chairperson, in that regard quickly, the 29 - sorry the evidence heard under Section 29, does not in any way record a list of the names of the injured and deceased persons at the Why Not. If it does not contain that list, nowhere in the evidence of the 29 proceedings, is there a list of the names of those injured and deceased persons.  It cannot conceivably be argued that the evidence was intended to be included as a result of the, albeit ambiguous (indistinct) under (9)(b)(iii).",

The first is when I received the bundle of documents, marked C, contained Greta Apelgren's evidence and indeed Mr McBride's, I immediately called Mr Currin to establish whether there was any privilege attached to them, as I understood 29 to be as my learned colleague, Mr Berger, argued and indeed the Committee understands it.  Mr Berger told me that there was an agreement prior to the 29 hearings, that any evidence led therein would never be used - sorry not Mr Berger, Mr Currin, sorry.  I see that that agreement is included on page 1 and 2 of the 29 hearing on Mr McBride's evidence and secondly Mr Chairperson, that whereas Mr McBride and I say this without prejudice, whereas Mr McBride has no difficulty with what he said in the 29 proceeding,  he has difficulty on advice from Mr Currin and myself that 29 proceedings in themselves, are privileged, and that the moment they are referred to within the ambit of these proceedings, then the level at which these documents and this evidence may well be used in subsequent proceedings, takes a different tone.   If it is confined to a 29 proceedings, then the level of prejudice and the content and the way in which it may possibly be used in criminal proceedings and any other proceedings, has a different tone to it, a different nature to it.",

Perhaps it would be wise at this stage to say that Exhibit C includes the 29 evidence of Mr McBride and Ms Apelgren and it has indeed been agreed between Mr Richard, Mr Prior and myself that Ms Apelgren's evidence will not be included in Exhibit C, it would be expunged from the record and would not be used, nor referred to.  The only premise on which they sought to have McBride's evidence included in the record is because of that ambiguous terminology in the application for amnesty by Mr McBride.  I think that is where the enquiry in terms of logistics begins and ends.  In terms of the legal argument, I agree with you fully Mr Chairperson, except that I have not prepared argument in that regard.  I think that inquiry legally is a very  important one, and perhaps ought to be properly addressed, researched and argued.  I for one would like to argue it after having properly researched the question.   Mr Chairperson, that brings me purely to privilege.  I don't concede that Mr McBride has waived his right to privilege.  He is not the one that handed over the document.  I think the question about privilege is not a simplistic one, it is not as simplistic as Mr Richard has you believe.   As I have already submitted, Mr Prior has erroneously caused the document to be included.  I have now explained fully the dates on which it was received, bear me out, I mean the date on which the application for amnesty was received, bear me out, and hence the privilege was not, sorry the handing over of the document was not the making of Mr McBride, that privilege is not waived by him.  I have submitted that the Act itself protects Mr McBride, the 29 proceedings were held in camera and I refer you Mr Chairperson, to page 1, of course purely for the legal argument, without causing it to be included in the record, to page 1 and page 2 of the evidence of Mr McBride in the 29 proceedings, two paragraphs in particular, on page 1, from lines 15 onwards where Mr McBride affirms and states and then the Chairman says \"this is an inquiry in terms of Section 29 of the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act of 1995.  This is not a hearing of the Truth Commission, but it is an investigative inquiry and as such in terms of the Act, is held in camera.  I want to stress that absolutely no finding will be made at this hearing, that is not the purpose of the hearing.  I will briefly outline the obligations and duties ...\" and then he deals with Mr Brian Currin, the Attorney-General's  inquiry, Mr McNally, and then on page 2, from lines 7 onwards on the second paragraph, the honourable Chairman says the following - \"the Act also provides that any incriminating evidence obtained at such an inquiry, is not admissible against you in a court of law, or any other institution that is established by law.\"  The one proviso to this, and that is that any evidence obtained at this hearing, may be used against you where and if you are charged with perjury arising out of the making of conflicting statements.  Honourable Chairperson and Members, I submit respectfully that Mr McBride and indeed Mr Currin who went into these 29 proceedings, did so fully understanding that to be the beginning and the end of the protection afforded them if they were to testify.

In this situation, the instructions and that is what I am here to implement is that they should not be granted amnesty.  Then to be more technical, one looks and explains what Section 20(3) provides.  That Section sets out what must be established before a Committee shall give amnesty.  My instructions in that regard are to contest the various aspects provided for in (2) and (3) and 1 of Section 20.

There came a time in the struggle and let me put a theoretical or hypothetical case, if we are in a combat situation and you have ANC combatants fighting against Forces of the regime and there are other civilians present at that time, often you found that the Security Forces were firing at the crowd and perhaps even at combatants.  The responsibility for that would have been then that would we then say that the ANC cadres or the combatants should not then fire back and that the Security Forces therefore had the leeway and to continue fighting in which ever way they wanted?  Because often the situation was created that the Forces of apartheid were ready to go on and fight and oppress and it was only when the Liberation Forces were able to fight back and strike at them, that they began to feel the pain and the hurt, it is when they themselves bled, that they realised that they did not have the stomach to die for apartheid.",

I will summarise the position taken by the Conference in these terms, that the struggle must be intensified at all costs.  Over the past nine to ten months at least, at the very least, there have been many soft targets hit by the enemy, nearly 500 people have now died in that period, massacred, shot down, killed secretly.  All these were very, very soft targets, they belonged to the sphere of the intensification of the struggle.  What we have seen in places like the Eastern Cape is what escalation means for everybody.  The distinction between hard and soft targets, is going to disappear in an intensified conflict in an escalating conflict.\"\n\tThat is what we are talking about.

If I could just follow that up, I hear you.  I hear the difficulties of operational command, we heard that from APLA themselves and we heard it now, how difficult that became as the struggle intensified as more and more people were recruited, training became less intensive and more difficult as the struggle intensified.  But what we are trying to gain and understand of in essence is for example, the so-called notorious MAGOOS bomb where the vast majority of victims were civilian in that particular case, we have heard that it was a last minute decision to change the nature of the target, the specified place.  Cadres on the ground made that sort of decision, what sort of censure in the light of what subsequently happened came from the high command when it became apparent that this was a big mistake in a sense, what steps were taken?\"\n\tMr Maharaj answered -\n\"... then I think that the MAGOOS bar has again been dealt with extensively by us and what we showed was that in the ordinary operational situation we were living in, in an environment where the overwhelming majority of our actions were correct, well targeted, achieved what they set out to achieve.  Then we come to a number of operations that begin to move in the grey, faulty, Intelligence, false flagging, enemy Force penetrating and misleading our forces on the ground, directing them towards a target not in keeping with our policy.

A vapour cloud explosion would basically be that inside of the refractunator you get the separation of the oil taking place, taking place at a high temperature, there is vapour generated as a result of it, that if that vapour escapes and if it drifts and does not explode immediately, it could drift over a civilian area and that would kill people.",

I would like to put it to this Committee that in fact, if you looked at the first Security Force casualties, they were in fact black policemen.   If you looked at the attacks in the Soweto area, at the Protea, Morocco police stations,  they were black policemen.   And any inference that these were aimed at whites, is rejected because through the struggle, all those that were part of the apartheid system, be they black or white, were targeted.  This was never a target, an attack against whites.  We never fought a racist war.  We fought to undo racism.  We sought to fight as best we could because we believed we fought a just war, we believed in justice, we tried to limit casualties and if we wanted to go on an indiscriminate campaign of terror, we would not have gone through so much pain in going for targets, trying to get inside of the targets, it is very easy.  It takes a few, it takes a pistol or two to kill so many.  We never did that.  We weren't Barend Strydoms that simply stood there and went pah-pah-pah at so many people.   That would have been dead easy.  We never sought to do that.  We actually thought about the targets at the end of the day, we knew that we had to get to a point, we had to bring the white racist regime to their senses and I believe it is because of the mature policies of the ANC that we have the kind of system in the country today, that we have.  You cannot simply make a switch from what people would like to portray the ANC as, and then to have a kind of government, a leadership in this country today, which upholds human rights to the extent that it does.  The racist regime would never have been able to make that transformation.  At all times they sought to hold onto the power and privilege and I think this kind of suggestion that we were just out on a campaign of terror, is rejected with contempt.  South Africa today is still able to continue and to grow, it is beginning to pull together as a united country, because of the maturity, because of the vision and insight of the ANC leadership.  President Mandela previously had said you know, we stretch out the hand of friendship to all but he said he had a problem, that very few whites, actually took that outstretched hand.  We talk of reconciliation, would a people that were bent on a campaign of terror, stretch out their hand so shortly after what the majority population had suffered for centuries, would they do that?

            "Mr Chairperson, I believe there is a very great need to desensitise all people that have been involved in the war, on all sides.  The Department of Defence has actually undertaken programmes to work towards bringing all of the integrated members closer together.  One of the important aspects would be to make people not be politically partisan, I know that the old SADF had the approach of saying there were a-partisan, but I don't believe anybody is a-partisan, I think people always have political views, etc.  But you can make them non-partisan or ensure that they do not do anything that will further or hinder any political party.\n\tIn the furtherance of that, the Department of Defence as part of its transformation programme had actually embarked upon a civil education programme which we had sought and had suggested at some point, that the Minister of Defence put to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and in fact a letter was written to the Archbishop Tutu, suggesting that we present this to the TRC, that programme is ongoing, it teaches all soldiers about the political life of the country, it talks about the constitution, it talks about what is democracy, it deals with the whole question of civil military relations, it goes on to deal with the law and armed conflict, it then deals with the whole question very thorny issue of cultural diversity, bringing people from different walks of life together, and lastly then the whole question of military professionalism.  In fact we have produced a booklet of guidelines for that purpose.  I in fact was the Chairperson of the work group that worked on the guidelines for it, this was a multi-faceted work group set up by the Minister of Defence, some two and a half, three years back, that has since produced the guidelines and I am currently the Chairperson of the Monitoring Committee that is looking at the implementation of these programmes inside of the Department of Defence.   \n\tI believe that this serves our purpose well, we go through a very difficult integration process and when tensions rise, I believe that the people will act in one way or the other, people also read certain things into certain actions of one person or another, and unfortunately we have seen the latest examples of it at Tempe.  I believe much more needs to be done, a greater impetus needs to be given to programmes like these, where we can bring people together.  I also believe that many of the people have not necessarily overcome the stresses of the past, and perhaps much more needs to be done in that regard.  A psycho-social support I believe needs to be set up in order to help people overcome the traumas of the past.",

            "Mr Chairperson, I would give my right arm to do that.  Last year when we convened in Pretoria, what was extremely moving for me was meeting with Neville Clarence, one of the Air Force soldiers that had been blinded as a result of the Church Street blast.   We discussed issues and ultimately we met, it was a very difficult process, but I believe something long overdue, something that we all need to do.  I have also contemplated doing much more for reconciliation, and in fact with my wife, speak about this whole question, maybe we should think of setting up some kind of institute for reconciliation, where people like myself and others could go in and work whether it is part-time, full-time, etc, and do things in order to bring about greater reconciliation.\n\tWith Mr Clarence, given his approach and his attitude, despite the fact that he is totally blind, he says he had accepted that he was a casualty of the war, he understood he stood on the other side, since then I believe we are becoming closer to each other, he has been to my home, had a meal together, and not so long ago, we were looking at the possibility during Arbor Week, of actually planing a tree of reconciliation, which we still intend to do and in fact the, about two weeks ago, I spoke to the Chief of the Air Force about it, and we agreed that early next year, on Air Force Memorial Day or something, we would do something of that sort.  But then we thought we would expand it and around the area of the Air Force, we would then  plant trees of reconciliation and we would invite people from all walks of life.  \n\tThe whole question of reconciliation is an extremely important one, and I believe that reconciliation can only be brought about one, if we are honest and truthful about our past, two, if we also accept that we have a common future.  President Mandela has often said that the black people of this country have their hand outstretched to the white population, to march together into the future.  Often it is the white population that spurns that hand, that outstretched hand.  \n\tI believe the ANC, I believe this government is very genuine when it says this country belongs to all who live in it.  We have never sought to drive the whites into the sea, if anything, we have encouraged them to become part of the mainstream to help in rebuilding the country, there is a lot that needs to be done.  We need the help of every single person.   We need to look at mechanisms to make the whites feel they are also part of a democratic South Africa.  \n\tWhen President Mbeki at the time when he was Deputy President, in Parliament says we are all Africans and he said whites are also Africans, what does he mean by that?  He says you are part of us, you don't belong in Europe, they are not Europeans, they are Africans.  They are part of our society, they are part of us.  To all we say, let us all be part, let us understand that what happened then was because of apartheid, it was that population or section of the population which saw themselves as greater beings than others, that sought to subjugate the black population and we fought against it.  We have now come to the point where we need to win them over, make them understand that we are all equals in the land of our birth and together we can work at it.  If I am given the opportunity, I will do everything I can.  I know in the Natal area we have a huge problem, I know perhaps more than in other parts of the country, and whatever we can do, we will do, whenever.  If it is required in part-time to do that, we will do that.  \tAt the end of the day I believe there is a broader objective that we have to serve, we have to fight for humanity, we have to fight for peace.  If I have to serve time for peace, I volunteer.  \n\tMay I also just take the opportunity Judge Pillay, to say if required, the guideline manual on civic education, can be made available and if you wish it in the next few days, I can contact my staff and have them send it down as soon as it is possible.",
