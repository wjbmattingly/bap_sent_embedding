The point is, if your memory has let you down you're not in a position to admit or deny it and if you're already confused about one Madondo, who is the only Madondo you remember and you say you remember from reports, then clearly something is wrong and all you're really being asked is to concede that something's wrong and that your memory isn't as good as you might want to otherwise suggest it is and that the possibility therefore exists that they may well be the same person.
