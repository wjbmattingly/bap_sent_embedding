<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">MS LOCKHAT:</span> The next amnesty applicant is Mr Pienaar.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, I've just been informed that we didn't catch that all.  Mr Pienaar, what are your full names please, just for record purposes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">FREDERIK JOHANNES PIENAAR:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Prinsloo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR PRINSLOO:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a>	Mr Pienaar, you are the applicant in this specific case, regarding actions on the 8th of June as well as the 12th of June 1988, which took place in Piet Retief, regarding which Mr de Kock has already given evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Chairperson, the application of the applicant appears in bundle 1, page 110 to page 117, in the middle thereof and then there is also an Annexure B, page 118 until the end of it, which would be page 125.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a>	Mr Pienaar, at the time of these events you were stationed in Piet Retief and you were the Branch Commander of the Security Branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> For how long at that stage had you been stationed there, approximately?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Approximately eight years, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Were you specifically involved with investigations and intelligence collection from Swaziland and as it was known then, the Eastern Transvaal/Natal region?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And did you make use of informers at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> In your staff at this time, a Mr Theron also served.  He is now a Major and he is also an applicant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> As well as a Mr Hayes, who is also an applicant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And Mr Botha?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And a Mr Barnard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> That is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> All of these persons are co-applicants in this matter.  Mr Pienaar, with regard to the first incident, is it correct that you were involved in a trial in the Circuit Court in Bethal, when Mr Theron, a co-applicant, who was then handling an informer of yours, informed you regarding certain information?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> That is correct.  But the informer was actually handled by Mr Theron himself and not by me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And your specific informer, as a result of that information, did you go and see that informer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes, at the office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And after you had obtained the information from this informer, did you make contact with our co-applicant, Mr Eugene de Kock?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And did Mr de Kock come to Piet Retief?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes, he did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And was he accompanied by certain members, as it is known today, from Vlakplaas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Was an action then planned regarding this first incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes, an action was planned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And was any vehicle used, such as a Corolla 1300 vehicle from the Detective Branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And who would have been the driver of that vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Lt Mose, from Col de Kock's people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And what would have been the planning?  Just briefly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> That he would stop at a place near the Swaziland border.  I can tell the Committee that the place was easily recognisable because there was only one great big dry bluegum tree in that area and that was the place where he was supposed to wait, and that was where the people would be brought to him, so that he could transport them to the RSA.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Mr Pienaar, according to your information, these persons who would be infiltrating, would they be usual or regular MK members, or what was the position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> They were all trained MK members.  At that stage there was a tremendous influx of MK members from Mozambique to Swaziland.  The Swazi police at that stage were experiencing quite a number of problems regarding MK members and they had to infiltrate as quickly as possible into the RSA.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And the MK members who infiltrated the RSA in such a manner, would they have been trained people, people who were armed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes, they would be trained armed persons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And according to the information, these persons would come in to sow terror, or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> They would come in to spread terrorism in the Natal area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And this specific informer, was he or she a reliable person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes, very reliable.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Was there any previous information of a reliable nature that had been provided by this person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And was Lt Mose aware of where the action would take place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> We pointed out the place to him where we would be waiting for his return.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Was he told what was expected of him upon his return to this place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> What was it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> It was arranged that he would flicker his headlights and also switch on his left indicator light if those persons whom he was transporting were armed.  He also, once he had brought the vehicle to a standstill, had to try and get away from the vehicle as immediately as possible.  If the persons that he was transporting were not armed, he would not have to switch on the indicator light, he would just have to pull over to the left side of the road and get away from the vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Mr Pienaar, that specific evening you, accompanied by Mr de Kock, Lt Ras, Theron, Hayes and Barnard, took up your positions at a specific place on the Houtkop road.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And were all of you armed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes, all of us were armed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And can you tell the Committee what took place while you waited there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> A vehicle approached from the Swazi direction in our direction, the lights were dimmed, the left indicator light was switched on and the vehicle came to a standstill virtually at the place where we were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a>	Immediately we jumped out and ran past the side of the vehicle into the bushes.  Major Hayes handled the searchlight, which he aimed at the vehicle.  The vehicle's windows were completely misted.  At no stage could I determine who was in the vehicle.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a>	Col de Kock opened fire and all of us fired at the vehicle.  I myself handled an R1 gun and I think if I recall correctly, I fired between five to seven shots, all of them at the left side of the vehicle, the front and the back left door.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a>	A man collapsed against the back door of the vehicle.  We approached the vehicle and ceased fire.  In the vehicle, in the front next to the driver was a woman, the man behind on the left was an Indian man, then there were two more women and one on the right-hand side of the vehicle, who lay out of the vehicle. I heard Mr de Kock telling Mr Ras to shoot the woman, upon which she was indeed shot one more time.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a>	After that I opened and searched the boot of the vehicle as well as the bags inside the vehicle, there were no weapons in the bags.  I also searched the persons briefly and also there did I not find any weapons.  We discussed this, Col de Kock and I.  He asked me whether I had any weapons at my office.  I did not have any weapons.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a>	He then told someone to contact Col Roelf Venter to obtain the necessary weapons and to bring them to the scene, upon which Mr Ras called Col de Kock to one side and told him that he had a pistol and handgrenades in his possession, at the scene.  Mr Ras placed the pistol next to the man.  He placed the man's hand around the pistol and fired two shots, so that shells would be found on the scene.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a>	He gave me two handgrenades, which I placed in the carry bags which belonged to the two women seated in the back of the vehicle.  This was done in order to create the impression that these persons had been armed and to prevent that any incident be created for the police and the State at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a>	I began to investigate the matter myself ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Just before you continue, Mr Pienaar, after this scene was created as you have just given evidence, was a service officer called out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes, there was a service officer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And who was he, can you recall?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> I cannot recall who was there on that night, it may have been a Combrink or another person, but I am not certain.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And after this scene was visited by the service officer, the bodies of the deceased were removed and taken to the State Mortuary?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And were these persons admitted to the mortuary?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Was the identity of the deceased known at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> At that stage, not yet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> So you have had nameless or anonymous persons in the mortuary?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And did you at that stage want the information surrounding this incident to be made known or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Why not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Because the informer had notified us that there were approximately 36 persons standing by to infiltrate.  We did not want to make it known that these persons had been killed because that would have broken the entire chain.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Could you determine within yourself whether any of those persons who had been shot there were known to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Chairperson, one of the women was recognisable from some period before that, I don't know how long before that, but it was quite some time, I arrested five persons near the Swaziland border, they were underway to leave the country and this woman, June Rose Kotoza was one of the persons who was arrested after I had brought her back to Durban and handed her over to the Security Branch here and they took back home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Continue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> I didn't see her again or hear from her again before this evening of the incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> You say that you yourself began to investigate the matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> With the objective of a post-mortem inquest?</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I beg your pardon, when did you find out that this was the particular person, June Rose Kotoza?</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> I recognised her due to her facial features, it was something that stayed in my mind.  I thought about it and then I realised that I had arrested her when she was on her way out of the country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a>	After that I took everyone's fingerprints and sent them to Durban for positive identification of all the persons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But you identified her by name before the fingerprints were sent away?</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did you have much to do with her upon her first arrest?</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes, I had interrogated her during her arrest, regarding who had accommodated her.  It must have taken about two days worth of interrogation, after which she was brought back to Durban.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, just one question before you proceed, Mr Prinsloo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a>	You said that you then started investigating the matter.  Did the Security Branch usually become involved in investigation of matters after the event had occurred?  Such as this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Chairperson, the Security Branch did investigate matters with regard to terrorism.  I did investigate this case.  Nobody stopped me from investigating it and I continued with it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Were any guidelines put forward to you as to what would be necessary of you if an inquest would follow?</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Chairperson, there were letters where terrorists were killed in conflict with the police, which was only necessary to get the commander of that operation, to obtain his statement and to hand it in, which I in any case did not do, I tried to investigate it as thoroughly as possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Mr Pienaar, were reports sent to the regional office as well as the Security Head Office, with regard to this instance?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes, Chairperson, there were ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Excuse me, Mr Prinsloo.  Mr Pienaar, I don't understand your question, that you investigated the matter as thoroughly as possible, because you did have all the information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> I did have the information, Chairperson.  What I meant with that was that the necessary statements were obtained, not only the statement from the officer who was in command there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So you tried to cover it up as completely as possible, not investigate it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> To an extent yes, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Mr Pienaar, could you also determine by means of fingerprints and information from Security Branch Durban, who these persons were and what their positions were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes, I did determine, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> The person Mr Naidoo, could you determine what his position was according to the information?</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> He was sought by Durban because of an attack on Minister Rasjbansi's house and the attack took place by means of handgrenades on the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And the three other persons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> They were all trained persons.  The one woman who was in front of the vehicle, I think the surname was Nyoka, was also known in Swaziland as a person who regularly infiltrated MK members and assisted to get into the RSA.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And then Mr Pienaar, on page 115 of your application you mention two women's names, June Rose Kotoza and Zendiwe Mthembu, you don't have the name of Nyoka there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes, it has to be added there, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And in paragraph 8 of the same page you mention that</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a>"Col de Kock gave instruction to Roelf Venter of Vlakplaas to plant two handgrenades and a pistol that came from Vlakplaas ..."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a>Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> No, that is incorrect, Chairperson, he said that we need to contact Roelf Venter, but before anything could be done about that, Mr Ras said that he had two handgrenades and a pistol with him.  Mr Roelf Venter was never close to the scene.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And were any persons sent beforehand across the border in this instance?</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> In the first instance, no, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And Mr Pienaar, if we could continue with the following instance which took place on the 12th of June.  There has been evidence already by Mr de Kock.  Did you also receive information from the same source in this instance?</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And was Col de Kock called in once again to Piet Retief?</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> That is so, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And with the information of the first instance, did anything take place the first day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Chairperson, I contacted my own Commander, Col Deetlefs, he was available, he came down himself to Piet Retief.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And for sake of completion for the Committee, Col Deetlefs was at that stage situated at Ermelo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> That is correct, Chairperson, he was in command of Ermelo as well as the sub-branch Piet Retief.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And was Col Deetlefs also tasked with the gathering of information and liaison with Swaziland, with regard to ANC actions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And did Col Deetlefs also come down to Piet Retief?</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> He did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Is it true that he joined you later that evening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> That is correct, Chairperson, he arrived there that evening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And with regard to this specific action, was use made of a small bus, a minibus?</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.  I contacted Col Rorich at Witbank with regard to assistance with the vehicle and he told me that he did indeed have such a vehicle which we could use and he came to Piet Retief with the minibus from Witbank.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And Col de Kock come with his members</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a>from Vlakplaas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> That's correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And was a planning launched?</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes, a planning was launched.  We decided on the same place where this first instance took place.  I called in Sergeant Manzini from the Detective Branch, to drive the vehicle to fetch the people ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, why did you call in Sergeant Manzini?  You said you called him in to drive the vehicle, but why did you choose Sergeant Manzini?</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> I knew him very well, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Mr Pienaar, was it with the knowledge of his commander at the Detective Branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes, it was with the knowledge of Lt Combrink.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That you would use Mr Manzini?</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> That's correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And this place where the action would take place, was it pointed out to Mr Manzini beforehand?</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes, where we would be.  Because he was a Detective in that district, he immediately knew when I told him where to wait at that large bluegum tree, he knew the place and no further instructions were necessary for him except for the flickering of the lights of the vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did Mr Manzini know that he would be transporting trained MK members, possibly armed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes, he was aware of it, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And that those persons would illegally come through the fence and be infiltrated into the Republic?</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And was instruction given to Mr Manzini what he had to do if these persons were armed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes, it was told to him to switch on the left indicator light and to get away from the vehicle as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Was Mr Manzini aware at all that shots would be fired, or what your specific plan would be besides that he had to bring these people to the scene and put on the indicator lights and jump out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> It was never said to Mr Manzini that when he gets away from the vehicle, that we would all start firing.  He might have thought so, but it was never specifically told him "Listen the minute you run away from the vehicle, we will start firing".  It was never put as such to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But you did tell him "Get away because we will fire"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> No, he just had to get away from the vehicle, but we did not say "Run, because if you get away we will start shooting immediately".</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But to get away, he could not draw any other inference other than that you would open fire?</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> I believe so, that there could be problems.</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Could he also believe that he would end up in cross-fire if he stayed there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> That is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Mr Pienaar, this action was launched and planned for the evening, that Col de Kock was in command together with Col Deetlefs, Rorich, Theron, Hayes, Barnard and then Mr Vermeulen from Vlakplaas and W/O van Zweel from Ermelo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And did you take up place in this pre-arranged place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> What happened then, Mr Pienaar?</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Before that, Botha, Cpt van Dyk, Mr Ras and I think Mr Tait were told to go to the rendezvous point at the border to surmise whether they could possibly intercept the persons who would bring the MK members to the border for infiltration.  They departed for Swaziland and later that evening the kombi returned from the border.</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a>	Manzini drove past us and I would not be able to say how far it was, it was a few metres past the place where he was supposed to stop.  I would also like to mention to the Committee that a plastic bag was attached to a branch where he had to stop.  He drove past, Col de Kock started running to the kombi and the rest of us followed.  Manzini did jump out of the kombi and immediately started running away, around the front of the kombi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a>	A male person climbed out of the left front door of the kombi with an AK in his hand.  And I am certain that this person fired a shot.  Later an AK shell was picked up there.  Col de Kock immediately started firing at this person and the other members also opened fire on this person and the other persons in the kombi.  After a while we ceased fire and the kombi was searched.</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did this actually take place very quickly, Mr Pienaar?</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes, Chairperson, it was very quick.  There were four men in the kombi, they were all fatally shot, an AK47 was found with them, with an extra magazine.  I secured all these weapons personally because they were all cocked.  And in two carry bags which were also in the kombi, I found two handgrenades.</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Two handgrenades in each bag or?</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> One in a bag, Chairperson, there were just two.  And we secured all these weapons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Were there any magazines?</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> There were two magazines for each AK, Chairperson, there was one in the weapon and one extra magazine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Was this scene visited by a service officer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> It as visited.</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And after the visit of the service officer the persons were taken to the State Mortuary.</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you in that case lead the inquest investigation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes, I took statements in this regard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> In the first instance, did you hear that questions were put with regard to clothing which belonged to the deceased, that includes Mr Naidoo and the three ladies?</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> What is the position there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> I can only mention that a while after the incident the deceased' parents were there.  I showed them the clothing and I asked them if they wanted to clothing back and they said no, they did not want the clothing.  The deceased's father asked ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Is that Mr Naidoo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes, Mr Naidoo. ... asked whether there was not a gold chain around his son's neck, and I informed him that I did not see such a gold chain.  Afterwards I destroyed the clothing because it was torn and bloodied.</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Were there any prescriptions with regard to bloodied clothes and such things?</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes, Chairperson, because of the various illnesses which come about there such clothing is destroyed if the next of kin did not want it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Why only after a while were the persons informed that people were killed there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> It was to prevent that head office immediately disclosed the events there and also because these persons in Durban, some of the deceased, refused to answer Durban's requests as to where their family members were, they denied to Durban Security Branch that their family members had left the country and later they arrived with their legal representatives at Piet Retief.</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> With regard to the investigation in the second incident, is it so that Col de Kock's name was not indicated as the commander there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> But Mr Deetlefs was indicated as the commander?</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes, because his division was there and because somebody, I'm not sure who it was, said by means of Ermelo office that we had to leave Mr de Kock's name out of that incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Was there any reason for that, or did you draw any inference because of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> I understood that they did not want to involved Col de Kock with two incidents so close to each other, and I did not make any further enquiries about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Is it so that the two investigations with regard to the inquest, were taken over, or the first one was taken over by Brig van Wyk, attached to the Detective Branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> That is correct, Chairperson, he continued with it right up to his retirement date where the matters were handed over to Brig Engelbrecht.</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Do you know from your own knowledge or not that the reports which were directed at head office from Middelburg were removed from Middelburg offices?</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> I don't know thereof, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> During the post-mortem inquest you gave evidence with regard to Mr Naidoo and the ladies.</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And is it so that there in certain instances you told lies?</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes, I did, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Why did you lie there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> It was to protect the State and the police from this incident where people were killed without weapons and which could be exploited by the enemy of the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And Mr Pienaar, in the second instance, did you also give evidence there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes, I did testify there, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And in that instance it was already put by Mr Moerane, who appears for the family, that apparently the family requested a postponement, which was not granted to them and that the evidence was only put from the one side?  ...(transcriber's own interpretation)</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And in that instance can you recall what you testified there, were there any lies?</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> None, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Mr Pienaar, with regard to the first instance, did you realise ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, did you at that second inquest mention that Mr de Kock was the commander?</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Excuse me, Chairperson, I just wanted to mention that now.  I did not mention it there, that Mr de Kock was not there.  Or that he was there, I did not mention that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And to follow up on the question of the Honourable Chairperson, it's that in that sense you told a lie there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And with regard to the first instance, is it so that you made yourself guilty of murder, that four people were cold bloodily killed there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.  I regarded it as a time of war against the ANC and the ANC saw it as war against the Security Forces.  It was an undeclared war which was started by people before my time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Excuse me, Mr Pienaar, did you think that one could shoot unarmed persons in a war?</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Chairperson, in that instance we could have waited and walked closer to the vehicle, but if one did that and they were armed, then we would have been killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> No, I asked you a general question, because you apply for murder, you don't apply in the sense that it was a matter of self-defence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> That's correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So my question to you is, do you think that one could shoot unarmed people in a war?</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> No, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And to follow up, Mr Pienaar, you believe that those people were armed, ongoing by the sign that was given by the driver?</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And shots were fired before you fired?</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> That's correct.  And mention was never made by the source or anybody that women would infiltrate the country.  It was said that it was trained MK members, but it was not mentioned that any women would be among them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> On that point.  In general, is it so or not that women who were members of MK and received training would infiltrate the country with arms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And then furthermore, Mr Pienaar, you also apply that you defeated the ends of justice by disclosing the incorrect facts to the Court.</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That you perjured yourself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And in the second instance you also apply for murder as well as you had disclosed false facts with regard to who was present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And what the true action would be.</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And you apply for amnesty for any other competent judgment that would emanate from the facts held</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a> before this Committee as well as for any other unlawful acts which might lead to civil charges.</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Just one moment's indulgence Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a>Thank you, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR PRINSLOO</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ms van der Walt do you have any questions you'd like to put to the applicant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Mr Pienaar, the persons who were under your command were Mr Hayes, Barnard and Theron, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> And Botha Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> More specifically Mr Hayes, Barnard and Theron, they were not involved with the discussions between yourself and Mr de Kock, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> No they were not continually present Chairperson but I believed that they did have knowledge about what was planned there, but they were not present all the time during our discussion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> That is correct and they will also testify that they knew that these persons would be lured into an ambush?</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And is it correct that Mr de Kock gave the instructions and they regarded him as their senior?</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> That is correct, we worked under Col de Kock at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And Mr van Dyk and Mr Botha also acted or crossed the border on the instruction of Mr de Kock?</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> No further questions thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS VAN DER WALT</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Mr Cornelius, do you have any questions you'd like to ask the applicant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR CORNELIUS:</span> Mr Pienaar, I'd just like you to sketch for the Committee the use of C Section. Security does certain actions and gathers information and then you request C Section to assist you, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> So you first obtain all the information and you identify the target and then you, in your capacity as Security takes the decision to involve C Section?</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> You have no doubt that these MK members who would come in and infiltrate Natal, would endanger the public and the government?</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> Did you have any doubt as to the quality or reliability of the informant from whom you obtained the information?</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> I had no doubt Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> Did you doubt about the quality of the information from the source?</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> No Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> Did you in the past test the information of the source and find it satisfactory?</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes, Chairperson, it was always indicated as correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> Did you believe that the vehicles which would come into these two ambushes, that the two occupants would be armed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> I was convinced thereof, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> Did you expect that a possible shooting could ensue?</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Definitely Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> After you had established the reliability of the source's information, did you convey it to Mr de Kock?  Did you believe that he would have the same conviction as you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes, I did believe so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> Was there any reason for Mr de Kock and his team to doubt your information or doubt the target which you had identified?</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> Or the fact that you believed that these people would be heavily armed, to doubt that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> No, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> Did all of you believe that it would be men or trained MK members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> We believed that it would be trained MK members and for no second did I even think of women.</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> So the logical question which this Committee would put to you is, was there another alternative to killing these persons, to eliminate them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Chairperson, yes.  They could have been arrested if one found many people, but there was always the possibility that some of your people could be killed or injured during such a skirmish.</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> And from appearances in the past before this Committee we have also learned that sometimes it was very difficult and there was sometimes a lack of evidence to prove a case against someone like this, after their arrest?</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> Did you then rely upon your judgment of the information which you had received and then take the easier route in eliminating these enemies or infiltrators?</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">MR CORNELIUS:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR CORNELIUS</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Mr Hattingh, do you have any questions you'd like to ask?</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">MR HATTINGH:</span> Yes, thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR HATTINGH:</span> Mr Pienaar, you have heard Mr de Kock's evidence that he himself had an interview with the informer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> With the?</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">MR HATTINGH:</span> With the informer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">MR HATTINGH:</span> You also heard his evidence that the person who climbed out of the left front side of the minibus did not fire a</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a>shot.  Is it possible that you may have confused his shot with the shot that you think this person fired?</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> No, I'm certain that this person did fire a shot.  As I explained to the Committee, there was also an AK shell which was found on the scene which, unlike the first case, was not fired by one of the members but by the deceased.</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MR HATTINGH:</span> Did that shell form part of the evidence during the inquest?</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, Mr Hattingh.  When you say that you were certain that Mr de Kock fired, besides the doppie that was found there, the AK47 doppie, is there any other reason why you say that you were certain that he fired?</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> I saw the fire from the AK.  I was diagonally behind Col de Kock.  I could see it clearly and I am convinced that this person did indeed fire a shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Is it possible, Mr Pienaar, that he actually fired that shot after Mr de Kock shot him as he fell backwards and that's where the shell comes from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> That would be a questions of seconds it is a possibility.  As I remember the situation, I watched the person, I saw the fire emerging from the weapon, I saw the beginning of</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a>the shot.  It would have been a question of split seconds.</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">MR HATTINGH:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR HATTINGH</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Mr van der Merwe, in Mr Booyens' absence, do you have any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER MERWE:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, just one question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR VAN DER MERWE:</span> Mr Pienaar, I am representing Mr Tait as well.  You confirmed that they crossed the border with the second incident on the 12th June under the command of Mr de Kock?</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER MERWE:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman, no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR VAN DER MERWE</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Mr Lamey?</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAMEY:</span> Thank you, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR LAMEY:</span> Mr Pienaar, did you subsequently have a conversation with Mr Manzini as to why he did not stop at the specific point?</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> I did, Chairperson.  Manzini explained to me, and this was also confirmed by the persons who had crossed the border, when the four MK members were picked up by Manzini they immediately cocked their weapons and climbed into the kombi.  They told Manzini not to worry, that if they were apprehended he shouldn't stop for anything, that they would protect him and that put a great fear into him and I think that it is for that reason that he drove past the mark before he stopped.</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I beg your pardon. Do you believe this or is this something that he told you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> He told me, Chairperson and it was confirmed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> No, the question to you was whether you had a conversation with Manzini?</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And then you believed him on the basis of your conversation or was there something specific that he told you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> He told me what happened there and I believed him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAMEY:</span> Your information from the informer and I am speaking of the second incident, I am representing Mr Nortje who was only involved in the second incident, your information was that the persons who were going to infiltrate would be armed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAMEY:</span> And for that reason there was an expectation that they had to be shot at in an ambush?</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes, we set up the ambush.</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAMEY:</span> You have already testified about this, but there was a real danger when it came to the loss of life on the Security Police side if under those circumstances they would have attempted a normal arrest.</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAMEY:</span> Mr Nortje confirms what you say and that is that after the shooting the weapons which had been cocked were found.</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAMEY:</span> Another aspect, do I understand your evidence correctly that you concede that the shot may possibly have been fired by the person who climbed out of the left of the minibus after de Kock had fired a shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> It is very difficult to say after the time.  We are speaking here of split seconds but what I recall is that I watched this man and that I saw the fire in his weapon when the shooting began.  An AK makes a much greater noise than a 9mm uzzi and as I've said, I watched the person and not Col de Kock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAMEY:</span> Very well because Mr Nortje says that he was practically next to de Kock and his recollection is that the person climbed out of the vehicle with the weapon, but that de Kock shot him before he could shoot de Kock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> That is correct, or possible.  As I've said, everything happened very quickly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAMEY:</span> Then just another aspect.  Was one of the reasons to eliminate the members on the Swaziland side, when Tait and Ras went there, also to protect your informer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes, that was one of the reasons, but we also realised that the infiltration would definitely stop there, seeing as the media would be notified of the incidents and Head Office would no longer keep it back.  The persons who were actually responsible for the infiltration would then have gotten away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Sorry, Mr Lamey.  Mr Pienaar, had you up to this point been able to avoid publicising the first shooting?  Had the media not gotten hold of that yet?</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> The first incident was not reported.</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I beg your pardon, Mr Pienaar, when was the second incident reported?</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> I think it was the day after the incident, I'm not certain of the exact date, it may have been two days afterwards because there was an incorrect report which was given to the media that the persons had used a stolen vehicle and that was never said by any one of us to Head Office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So the first announcement was not by Mr Vlok in Parliament?  Was there anything before that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> It was publicised after the second incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Before Minister Vlok said anything about it in Parliament?</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> I don't know when he said anything about it, I don't know whether these incidents ran concurrently.  I don't have any documentary proof before me now but I think that it was considerably later, somewhere near the 20th of the month, or something like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But then the media must have had the information before Mr de Kock announced it, but they did not make it known?</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAMEY:</span> Was there a person on the Swazi side who had to be eliminated, who was a very important liaison person with your informer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes.  The informer arranged for the vehicles to transport people and it was done by the person who was in Swaziland.</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAMEY:</span> Very well.  The person on the Swaziland side who allowed the MK members to infiltrate would probably, after the second incident have put two and two together and possibly have identified the informer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAMEY:</span> And that is why the informer was also protected?</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAMEY:</span> Then something further.  I don't know whether I understand your evidence correctly, but my instructions from Mr Nortje are that the driver of the minibus with the second incident, which was obtained from the Detective Branch, the point in the road where the ambush was to be set up was discussed with the driver and it was pointed out to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAMEY:</span> Because he was there physically?</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAMEY:</span> Then, did Mr de Kock telephone you along the way?  They went to a hotel and you also went there, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> No, I didn't go there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAMEY:</span> You didn't?  Because my instructions from Mr Nortje are that you arrived there, or that you knew that they would be there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> No, I knew that they were at Island Rock for the weekend.</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAMEY:</span> No, I mean on the way back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> No, I didn't go to the hotel, not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I beg your pardon, which hotel are you referring to?  Is this the bar at Moolman, or what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAMEY:</span> Mr Nortje recalls it as a hotel.  It may be that very same place.  We're not really speaking of any other place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> No, I did not go to the hotel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you at Moolman's?</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> The Moolman hotel, no.  I know the place very well but I didn't go there with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAMEY:</span> Where did Mr de Kock make contact with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> At the office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAMEY:</span> Did he arrive there at the office?</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> I don't know whether he called first, it's possible, but he did arrive himself at the office later on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAMEY:</span> Did you contact him at Island Rock with regard to the second action?</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> No, he didn't contact me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAMEY:</span> Did you contact him at Island Rock?</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> No, I didn't.  There weren't any telephone facilities there.  It's a house on the beach and there are no facilities for a telephone or a telephone box.</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAMEY:</span> Did Mr de Kock arrive at the offices coincidentally before the second incident, or was there any arrangement with regard to it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Chairperson, he arrived there because the informer had said that the persons had to infiltrate quickly, that there would be a number of groups entering the country successively.</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just correct me if I'm wrong.  Didn't Mr de Kock say that he went to some police station that was nearby Island Rock and then made phone calls from a police station, I've forgotten the name of it, from time to time to your offices?</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> That was from Mbazwana.  I have said it is possible that he may have contacted me from there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAMEY:</span> I just want to put it to you that Mr Nortje's instructions to me regarding the relevance thereof are that after the proceedings, or at least the proceedings would be ended at the hotel in Piet Retief from where they would drive back to Pretoria and my instructions are that you were aware thereof that they would visit the hotel and that you indeed visited the hotel and that that was actually the beginning of the second operation.  That's where it was discussed.  This is according to his position and his recollection.  I'm not saying by that that there were previous conversations which he has negated, but I'm just putting it to you that he says that you were there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> No, I wasn't there, not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAMEY:</span> Mr Chairman, I just want to make sure, I think I've finished.  Yes, I've got no further questions thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR LAMEY</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you, Ms Lockhat, no sorry, Mr Jansen, do you have any questions you'd like to put to the witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR JANSEN:</span> Mr Pienaar, during these operations at Piet Retief we could probably accept that the persons involved there relied upon your intelligence and the accuracy of your information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> In 1988, for how long had you been in the Security Police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> I think it was approximately 12 years.</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> And am I correct when I say that 8 years thereof were specifically related to the former Eastern Transvaal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> You were well familiar with the existing information regarding the ANC's activities in Swaziland?</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes, I was aware of certain things which took place there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> You must have been aware of the names of certain individuals?</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> Now were you satisfied in your summaries that these persons who were coming through were trained ANC cadres and that your summary was accurate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes, I was satisfied with it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> It would appear to me that to a great degree thereafter, I want to refer you, for the purposes of the record, to certain aspects of the record and ask you whether this correlates with your recollection and whether this is also a correct summary of the events.  If we look at bundle 2, page 48, have you seen this document before?</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> I think so, yes, Chairperson, I'm not entirely certain about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> Well it may be that this was the sort of document that was submitted to the post mortem inquest.</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> I cannot recall whether or not this was submitted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> Well on face value do you confirm this document?  That Lindwe Mthembu was regarded as</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a>"a soldier of our people's army, Umkhonto weSizwe"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a>as it appears there in the second paragraph.</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> Is that in accordance with your evidence of that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> Then there is something that you may not know about, but for the purposes of the record, page 61...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I beg your pardon Mr Jansen, is this relevant to Mr Ras' version, is it in dispute in any way because it does form part of the bundle?   I beg your pardon, I'm just asking whether or not it's necessary to go through this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> Chairperson at the end of the day I will argue that it is not necessary but suggestions have been made that these persons were not connected to the ANC and I am also not going to present that this information is direct evidence which can be unequivocally proven, this is something which can be questioned, it is of second rank nature.</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I don't wish to stop you but if I understand you correctly, the witness has already said that he understands that Mr Ras stood under the command of Mr de Kock and that it was not Ras' duty to confirm or deny the information and you are acting for him.  If it's absolutely vital for you to go through this, go ahead, but otherwise I don't really understand why.</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> Chairperson then for the purposes of the record I want to indicate that at certain places there are indications within the record which connect the deceased  to the ANC and more specifically with MK and that I will leave this over for the sake of argument.  I may also for the sake of information point out the question that you put regarding Mr Adriaan Vlok.  On page 121 of Bundle 2 there is a report which was placed on the 17th June which refers to an announcement made by Adriaan Vlok the previous day, which was the 16th.</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">MR JANSEN:</span> I just want to see if I have any other - Mr Chairman, I have no further questions, thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR JANSEN</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Mr Moerane?  Mr Lamey?</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a>Yes, Mr Lamey.</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAMEY:</span> I apologise, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">FURTHER CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR LAMEY:</span> Mr Pienaar, I omitted to ask you whether you were the investigating officer with regard to the second incident as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> I began it and then the investigation was taken away from me and Brig van Wyk became involved in the matter.  After him it was Brig Engelbrecht.</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAMEY:</span> Is the only fact which was false according to you in the statement you made the involvement of Mr de Kock, or are there other statements?</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> No, I can only recall saying that Mr de Kock was not there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you say that the minibus belonged to the Witbank Security Branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> I don't believe that I actually stated that in the case itself, but the fact that it later emerged that the vehicle was that property was stolen by the media, but I never reported that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But you never said where the vehicle came from, while you knew?</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> I'm not certain of that, I may have said that it came from Witbank because Mr Rorich himself was present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> In the second investigation of the 2nd incident, did you say that it was a trap?</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> I'm not entirely certain, but I think I may have said that.  That it was not a stolen vehicle and that it came from Witbank.  I'm not entirely certain about it but I do believe that I said so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Lamey.</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAMEY:</span> Mr Pienaar, wasn't it also so that in that inquest you had to suggest that there was a road-block instead of an ambush?</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes, Chairperson, we spoke of a vehicle with a blue light which was parked in the road.  That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAMEY:</span> In other words the stopper vehicle.  That is also false information?</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAMEY:</span> Thank you Chairperson, I have nothing further.</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR LAMEY</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Lamey.  Mr Moerane do you have any questions you'd like to put to Mr Pienaar?</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MOERANE:</span> Mr Pienaar, is it correct that you made your application for amnesty on the 13th December 1996?</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> I'll have to consult the date, I'm not certain of the date.  13th December 1996.</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Do you know when the cut-off date was for amnesty applications?</p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> No, it was a short while after the application was submitted, I'm not certain of what the precise date was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The ultimate cut-off date was September 1997.  Yes, but there were various - the cut-off date kept being extended, but the last cut-off date, the last final date was September 1997, but I'm not sure when the cut-off date was after that date you've mentioned now December 1996.</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> 15th December.</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It was the 15th December I'm told by Mr Malan, but that later extended.</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Well at the time that you made your application for amnesty, you did not know that the cut-off date was going to be extended.</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> I don't believe I knew that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, I don't think anyone would have known that, those extensions only came later.</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> So it appears, in a manner of speaking, you made your application at the 11th hour?</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes, we submitted it late.</p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Is there any reason why you delayed until the 11th hour?</p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> No, Chairperson, there was no specific reason.</p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> You see, there is something that concerns me about not only your application, but also the applications of Maj Hayes, Capt Barnard, Maj Theron in particular and that is they were all made more or less the same time, do you confirm that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> That's correct, yes, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> They were made from apparently the same computer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes, I believe so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> They are made in the same language.  A great part of the applications are word for word the same, identical.</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> That may be possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Even mistakes, patent mistakes are the same.</p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> I did not read everybody's application, it may be possible, I am not certain.</p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> At this stage I'd like to intervene.  When these applications were drafted the applicant could well have said "I've read the application of Mr X and I confirm that"  but for the purpose of expedience, each one has to have his own application.  If he's not in possession of the other one's application, then surely it would be superfluous not to copy it in the circumstances.  It was not up to the witness and it was us who drafter the applications Mr Chairman. Instructions were given to us, we drafted the applications and now the applicant's being accused of this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He hasn't been accused, he's just been merely asked a few questions about the similarity between the applications, I haven't heard any accusations yet.  Maybe a question will be coming out of it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Well, not yet.  For instance there are strangely similar mistakes.  For instance all of you say that the people who died in the first incident were three persons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> That is a faulty statement because there were definitely four persons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Well, and you signed the affidavit to that effect, didn't you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> There's also the question of Rasjbansi, same spelling right through.</p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> I don't know that, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> The spelling of one of the deceased, Kotosa, same mistake right through.</p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> That may be possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Was this a genuine application for amnesty, Mr Pienaar?</p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Would you repeat your question please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Was this a genuine application for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Are you in a position to tell the Committee, I'm asking about you now, not your legal adviser, but are you in a position to say why there's such a similarity, word for word in these applications?</p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> I cannot say myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Was that not also a problem at the inquest, that statements were in identical words, statements of different witnesses?</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> I read the statement Mr Chairperson and there were certain unclarities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> You say in your application amongst other things and you have not said that in your evidence, paragraph 6, page 114, first bundle, 2nd sentence,</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a>"I was under the impression that I saw the barrel of a gun."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Now that comes close to the false version that you and others proffered at the inquest.</p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> No, Chairperson, I said during the investigation that a shot was fired from the vehicle at us and here I was simply under the impression, I'm not saying that this is fact.  I was under the impression.  It could have been anything, it could have been the person himself, it may have been his hand, it doesn't mean that it is the same as the post mortem inquest.</p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry I missed it, what did you say at the inquest?</p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> That the person fired at us from within the vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Well, in this particular statement, bundle 1, weren't you trying to stick as close as you could to the original version?  In other words, give the impression that when you shot, at least you were under the impression at the time that there was a firearm, barrel of firearm, pointing at you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> That was only my impression, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> What gave you that impression?</p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> As I have said, the window started opening, it may have been the person's hand, because we were expecting armed persons I may have had the impression that it may have been a weapon, but that was only my impression.</p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Wasn't the light shining into that motor vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> That is correct, Chairperson, but the windows were totally fogged up, it was at night, and one cannot see exactly  all the things that happen and to say what it was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> You mentioned this source that gave you the information with regard to the infiltration on the first occasion.  Did I understand you correctly to be saying that that was actually not your source, but it was Mr Theron's source?</p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> That's correct, Chairperson.  The actual handler of the source was Mr Theron.</p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> But was that source available to you also?</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes, I would never have consulted him alone, that was not the use except for when Mr Theron was on leave, then I would have done so otherwise it would be in his presence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> So, was the practice then that a particular handler had his own sources, but in the absence of that handler somebody else could have access to that source?</p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.  Usually it would be the Commander, because there is a position of trust that is established by the member and the source.  It is not well that one person has sole access to such a source.</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Now you've told the Committee that this source was always reliable.</p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> That's correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Now did that source give you any information with regard to the infiltration that was due to take place on the night of the 8th June?</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> She did inform about that, about the infiltrations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> What was her information, what did she say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Mr Chairman, is this in regard to this particular investigation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The 8th of June one, is that correct Mr Moerane?  He's asking about the first incident.  What information was received relating to the first incident, the one that took place on the 8th of June?</p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Transport had to be arranged for trained MK members to infiltrate the country and which we indeed arranged and that there were several groups which had to infiltrate from Swaziland and it all had to take place as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Yes, Mr Pienaar, I'm talking to you about a specific infiltration.  The infiltration of the evening of the 8th June  1988.</p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> The information was given by the source, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Moerane wants to know if there's any more detail relating to the 8th June?  Was there any further detail?</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> No, only that trained persons had to be brought into the RSA.</p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was there any detail given about those people and their numbers etc?  In other words, what made you decide to send a Toyota Corolla rather than a minibus?</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> No, Chairperson, no numbers were given nor was any sex given.  I don't believe that the informant had that information because the other person who was killed in Swaziland later, had brought the person to her and she did not know how many persons there would be.</p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Well, how would you have been able to cater for the number of persons if you did not know how many people were coming that particular night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> It was a vehicle that was available and I took a chance with the vehicle.  The vehicle was actually too small for the persons, Chairpersons, because there were four persons plus the driver, which makes up 5 for a Toyota Corolla 1300 which was a bit much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> You're telling this learned Committee that you did not know how many people were going to enter the country that night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> As far as I can recall not, Chairperson, with no certainty it was said that there would be four exactly, it may have been possibly four, but I cannot recall four exactly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Wasn't there an earlier infiltration, a day or so before that that was aborted, that went awry because the people went to the wrong place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Repeat the question please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Wasn't there an infiltration that was supposed to have taken place a day or two before that involving an Indian man?</p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Not that I am aware of, Chairperson.  It was only the one and no Indian man or woman or anything like that was ever mentioned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> So you did not make any arrangements for an infiltration a day or two before that, or can't you remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> There may have been, but I don't recall Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can you recall at any stage making arrangements for infiltrations and the arrangements not being carried out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> There were previous instances where people would have come in where this did not come to fruition.</p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> In your experience at the Security Branch offices at Piet Retief, some of the ANC people who infiltrated were armed and others on other occasions were not armed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> There were persons who were armed, Chairperson.  I am trying to think of one that was not armed.  There was one woman who was not armed.  She did come through the gates because of a trap that was set for her.  She was arrested.  There were instances where they were also not armed, where the arms were already within South Africa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> You mentioned one of the deceased, whom you had arrested on an earlier occasion; when she came through on that earlier occasion, was she armed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Chairperson, I did not say she came into the country.  They were underway leaving the country when she was arrested, not when she came in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> You know that some of the people who are infiltrated into the country are infiltrated to do political work, propaganda work and not military work.</p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> There were such instances yes, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Did your source have that type of knowledge as to whether or not these people were coming in for political work or for military work?</p>
<p class="line" id="line546"><a name="pos546"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> No, Chairperson, not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> In any event you say, or do you confirm that this person was subsequently arrested by the ANC and detained?</p>
<p class="line" id="line548"><a name="pos548"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> That is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> And was released subsequently?</p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> And in 93 she was detained in Piet Retief, or at least an appearance was made - it was made to appear that she was being detained at Piet Retief?</p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Who is that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> The source.</p>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> She was never detained in Piet Retief.</p>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> I see.  Well I personally do not believe and my instructions are not that she was actually detained, but that's what she says.  She says she was detained.</p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> No, Chairperson, that is not so, she was never detained at Piet Retief, not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Warrant-Officer with regard to the first incident, do you confirm firstly that this was an ambush?</p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> And that there was no intention of effecting an arrest?</p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> That is also correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> And that there was no road-block established there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> In fact people were lying in wait.</p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> And the intention was to eliminate these people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line566"><a name="pos566"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> You see, in your statement you don't mention this instruction from Col de Kock to Maj Ras to shoot one of the deceased.</p>
<p class="line" id="line568"><a name="pos568"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> No, I did not mention it there.  I later thought about the incident, Chairperson.  I did not mention in detail in the application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Is there any particular reason that you didn't mention that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line570"><a name="pos570"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Maybe I did not remember it that day and only thought about it later.</p>
<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> You mention that the firearm was produced by Maj Ras and the handgrenades.</p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> On the other hand, what you do say , Mr Chairman this is on page 115, paragraph 8,</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a>"Col Eugene de Kock gave instruction to Roelf Venter from Vlakplaas to obtain two handgrenades and a pistol of Russian origin which would be from Vlakplaas to plant this in the vehicle."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes, that is in the application, Chairperson and I say that I suspect there must be some confusion because we did mention Roelf Venter but Mr Ras had the handgrenades and the pistol with him and he brought it there for placement.  It was just mentioned wrong because of this misunderstanding.  Mr Roelf Venter was never there.  We did mention him and that is where his name came about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Neither do you mention in your application that Maj Ras got his finger and that of deceased, Leni Naidoo, round the trigger to fire.</p>
<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> No, I said he place his hand over the weapon after which he fired two shots.</p>
<p class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Is there any reason why you didn't mention that in your application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> No, there is no reason therefore.  I did not put everything in detail as such.  Mr Ras mentioned in his application what happened there.  I cannot say everything on his behalf.</p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Well, but wasn't this important particularly in the light of your false affidavit that you made in the inquest proceedings where you said that Mr Naidoo shot and that handgrenades were actually found in their possession?</p>
<p class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Chairperson it may be so, but every person who was there, I cannot say what every person who was there did.  The persons apply for amnesty themselves, they mention in their own applications what they did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Let's deal with what happened after the first incident.  Is it correct that the first incident became known, certainly at the police station Piet Retief?</p>
<p class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Yes, that is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> And instead of an entry being made in the occurrence book, reporting or recording this incident, an entry was made that this matter shouldn't be spoken about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line585"><a name="pos585"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> The officer who visited the scene handles that case Chairperson.  I did not handle it but I did ask that the matter not be disclosed because of future infiltrations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line586"><a name="pos586"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Is it correct that no record was kept of the clothing of the deceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> I don't know whether there were any entries into the mortuary book, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line588"><a name="pos588"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> I suggest to you Mr Pienaar, you know that because that matter was canvassed at the Piet Retief inquest.</p>
<p class="line" id="line589"><a name="pos589"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> As I have said, I burned it later.  I don't know whether there was any existing record.</p>
<p class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The bodies of the deceased persons, were they kept, you said in the mortuary, what was this a state mortuary, was it at the hospital?</p>
<p class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> It was a state mortuary Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> At the hospital?</p>
<p class="line" id="line593"><a name="pos593"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> No, at the police station.</p>
<p class="line" id="line594"><a name="pos594"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> And I put it to you that you know that no entry was made either of the existence of this clothing or the destruction thereof.</p>
<p class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> It may be possible Chairperson that nothing was made of it.  I am not entirely certain of it though.</p>
<p class="line" id="line596"><a name="pos596"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> I further put it to you that you did not show this clothing to any of the parents of the deceased.</p>
<p class="line" id="line597"><a name="pos597"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> I did show the clothes, Chairperson.  The parents were with a legal representative, I cannot recall his surname now, but he was also at the inquest.  At the police station I showed them the clothes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line598"><a name="pos598"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you're talking about parents, are you talking about all the parents of all four of the deceased persons, four sets of parents?</p>
<p class="line" id="line599"><a name="pos599"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> Chairperson, what I can recall specifically, Mr Naidoo's parents were there, there were some people with him.  I showed them the clothing and asked them if they wanted the clothing in the presence of their legal representative whereupon they answered that they did not want the clothes, they were just looking for a little chain which belonged to Mr Naidoo and I did not see or have the chain.</p>
<p class="line" id="line600"><a name="pos600"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Moerane, when it's convenient...(indistinct - microphone not on) until tomorrow but when you get to a convenient time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line601"><a name="pos601"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Mr Chairman after the clothing issue it will be a suitable stage.  Mr Pienaar you seem to have forgotten what you said at the inquest about this clothing.  Are you now telling this Honourable Committee that the parents of this Nyoka, this Mthembu and this Kotosa told you that they were not interested in the clothing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line602"><a name="pos602"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> No, I refer to Mr Naidoo's parents, Chairperson.  I say that there were other persons with him.  I don't know who they were but I spoke specifically to Mr Naidoo's parents.</p>
<p class="line" id="line603"><a name="pos603"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Let's hear what you're trying to say.  Did the parents of the three deceased that I've mentioned tell you they were not interested in the clothing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line604"><a name="pos604"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> No, Chairperson, I did not speak to them.  Not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line605"><a name="pos605"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> I put it to you that none of the clothing was shown, physically shown to Mr Naidoo or the parents of the other deceased.</p>
<p class="line" id="line606"><a name="pos606"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> The clothes were shown to them Chairperson, as I've said, in the presence of their legal representative who was there with them in the mortuary at Piet Retief.</p>
<p class="line" id="line607"><a name="pos607"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Whereabouts?</p>
<p class="line" id="line608"><a name="pos608"></a><span class="speaker">MR PIENAAR:</span> There was a little hall within the mortuary.  If the inquest is held, clothes are placed in a drum there, in the mortuary itself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line609"><a name="pos609"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOERANE:</span> Mr Chairman, this might be a convenient stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line610"><a name="pos610"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you.  We'll now adjourn until tomorrow morning when we continue with these proceedings.  I discussed it with the legal representatives this morning and just subject to whether or not Mr de Kock could be brought in time, we would like to start at 9 o'clock tomorrow.  Is that possible for the Department of Correctional Services?  I'm addressing the person next to you, Mr de Kock.  Is it possible to be here at 9 tomorrow, please because we'd like to start at 9 o'clock.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line611"><a name="pos611"></a>We'll then adjourn.  At this same venue tomorrow to start at 9 o'clock in the morning.</p>
