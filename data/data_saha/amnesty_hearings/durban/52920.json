I understand that notice was sent to the prison where they were serving a sentence, only to find that they had been released on parole.\n\tI understand from Mr Sadar Govender with the Witness Protection, that Mr Sibisi had been informed on Thursday of the hearing today and had been requested to contacted Mr Samuel, the attorney that had been arranged for him.  Unfortunately Mr Sibisi hasn't made that contact, yet I understand from this morning's conversation with Mr Govender is that Mr Sibisi had been told the hearing would be in Pinetown so ...",

We on Thursday are starting a part-heard matter which we hope to conclude on Thursday because one of the Committee Members will not be available on Friday, so perhaps Friday will be the most convenient day to adjourn this matter to.\n\tAnother thing that worries me, Mr Prior, and I know that you are at a disadvantage at the moment because you haven't got your papers with you, that we are sitting in a large hall that was once a theatre and there is not a single person here.  \n\tNow the matter we were due to hear was a matter in which two people were murdered and there was an attempt to murder six others, and I would have thought that there would have been families and interested parties who would have wanted to hear.  It may be that notice was given to them to go to Pinetown.  Could you, if you can when you get your documents, make every endeavour to ensure that possibly interested parties, I don't mean interested parties in the legal sense but parties who might wish to hear what happened are notified that it will be heard on Friday?",
