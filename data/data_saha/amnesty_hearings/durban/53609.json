This farm, according to my knowledge, was used as a safe-house by Col Vorster.\n\tIt was arranged that Wasserman and I would meet Vorster in Pietermaritzburg and we followed him in our vehicle to the farm, where we arrived at dusk.  On the farm we met Col Taylor and a black man.  While the black man was left behind in the house, Col Taylor told Vorster, Wasserman and myself certain information outside the house.  As far as I can recall, the information was to the effect that the man, Tekere was a trained terrorist and that he was a member of the ANC's Special Operations Unit.  He was arrested while he was on his way to place an explosive device in the Durban area.  \n\tCol Taylor also informed us that he tried to recruit Tekere, but that he was not successful.  Taylor was of the opinion that he could not release Tekere because he would disclose the identity of askaris to the ANC and that he would continue with his terrorist activities.  He also did not have any evidence which he could use to have Tekere prosecuted.  Col Taylor informed us that he consequently decided that Tekere had to be eliminated and he ordered Wasserman and I to carry out this order.  From this information it became clear that Tekere was abducted and was detained unlawfully.  \n\tOn the grounds of the following actions I associated myself with this.  Vorster indicated a place to us in a plantation of pine trees close to the road which led to the garage.  Wasserman and I dug a grave there with the spades which Vorster supplied to us.  When we were done, we returned to the house where Tekere was informed that he would be moved to another place and he was blindfolded.  I think Tekere was cuffed all the time, with his hands behind his back.  \n\tWasserman and I walked Tekere down the road and at some point close to the grave, Wasserman hit Tekere over the head with a baton and he fell unconscious.  After he fell on the ground, Wasserman shot him in the head and chest with a silenced Makarov pistol.  We removed Tekere's clothing, placed him in the grave and closed the grave.  Afterwards we went back to the house.\n\tThe clothing of Tekere was burned right there on the farm, if I recall correctly, a fire was made outside the house.  Afterwards we returned back to Durban.",
