The problem being is that the family homes are no longer in the kwaZulu Natal area and the family is employed in Pretoria and obviously Mr Khubeka is in Denmark, but we will endeavour to get those photographs as soon as possible and hand them over.  We have no objection to do that.  I have discussed with Mr Wagener the types of photographs he wants and we'll try and oblige in that regard.\n\tAs regards inspection, I think we've agreed that it's necessary.  I think most parties around the table are in agreement with that.  It's the timing that hasn't been resolved.  We are of the view and when I say \"we\", myself and Mr Samuel are of the view that it would be better served if we did the inspection sooner rather than later in order that that would assist us in our cross-examination of the future witnesses.  Also, it's my experience that the inspection is usually done at the beginning of trials fro that specific purpose.",

Well the first point is, I'm not entirely convinced in my own mind as far as that might be worth anything, that an inspection is essential, either of the one or the other spot, but by the same token, we have no objection.  But Mr Chairman, there are two considerations why we would submit that the evidence should be heard before we go off on an inspection.  The first is, it is not critical at this stage for the inspection to be held, as my learned friend has pointed out, for the trial to proceed smoothly and we believe it's proper, Mr Chairman, that an applicant should give his evidence first and that thereafter an inspection be held, so that his evidence can in that sense be tested.  Mr Chairman, secondly, the applicants are here in their own interest, we are fully aware of that, but there are some of my applicants who are working for themselves.  Mr van der Westhuizen is a contractor who is working in the Transkei, making roads, and in Dundee and Newcastle and he looses a lot of money by being here, so does Mr Botha and we would prefer to deal with the next two witnesses and thereafter Mr Chairman, we would be entirely in your hands as to when and how and if, you wish to conduct an inspection in loco.  Those are our views.",

We'll then take an adjournment and the go and do this inspection.  I don't know if - we'll see how long it takes and we might have time to come back here and you say we won't - yes the trouble is it's in two different directions.  Yes, perhaps then if we can adjourn and then just make arrangements on who's going and how.  Yes, we had a brief meeting now.  You will recall that I said we are now going off on an inspection in loco.  We have, however been informed by the Commission, one of the Commission's logistics officers that it wouldn't be possible to have a proper inspection in loco at this time.  They need a bit of time to prepare for it, you need batteries fro the cameras, transportation etc and after discussing the matter, it's been agreed that what we will do is we will meet here at half past 8 tomorrow morning and then we will proceed in the first instance to the shooting range in the Winkelspruit area and from there we'll then proceed to that Inanda road area that's been referred to.
