I do not submit that the evidence of others ought not to be taken into account, but all I'm saying is that there are serious contradictions from the applicant's case as to the reason why this man was killed.\n\tNow coming to the political objective, we now know that none of the applicants was ever involved in the conflict that was taking place between the IFP and the ANC there and for that matter, none of them was a member of the ANC.  They may have been supporters, the point is that the policies of the ANC were not followed and the action as it is had nothing to do with the policies of the ANC, it just was not an action which was intended to further the aims of the struggle waged by the ANC, in whatever manner as it is and on that basis and that basis Chairperson only, the application should be dismissed.  There are some other issues as well which I may take up, but I can only do so if the Committee may require me to at this stage Chairperson.",

The simple removal of those arms from the deceased could have meant that Inkatha's\nsupply could have been cut off and I think that could also have been taken into account in regards to a political motive.",
