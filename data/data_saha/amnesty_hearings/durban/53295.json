My aim was to go to Durban, but I couldn't take that taxi because I met a certain group who came and swore at me and some of them were calling me \"klova\", and this group of people denied me to proceed with my journey.  I ended up going back to Baboi at home.  They followed me.\n\tWhen I was in the taxi, one of them who was one of the group, grabbed me through the window, taxi window and grabbed me with my T-shirt and I lost my button there.  His name was Sandile.  The taxi left before the whole incident went bad.  They tried to follow the taxi but the taxi left.  When we arrived at Baboi, I went home.  When I was near the school I heard people swearing at me.  \n\tWhen I turned back I realised that they were the same group who promised that they were going to follow me and they continued swearing at me.  That is when I lost it and I realised they were telling the truth when they said they wanted me.  I decided to go and face them.  I had a plan.  I didn't want them to realise that I was attacking them as well and they only realised when I was closer to them.  It was near a certain school called Sister Jones.  I crossed the road because I wanted to attack them from the back.  ...(intervention)",

I think it is common cause, the fact that there was tension and especially in the South Coast, between the IFP and the ANC. \n\tI think it can also be accepted in a broad sense that there wasn't a, even if it wasn't a war in the sense that it was a war on paper and everybody accepted it, but there was in a big sense a war in the whole of KwaZulu Natal, and I'm sure that his has emanated from most of these applications.\n\tIt seems to me that the subjective mind-set of the applicant at that stage was that as a member of the IFP, being in that situation where there was conflict and him being specifically targeted as a person being sworn at and maybe threatened in a way, that he could now pro-actively attack ANC people and thus, like he testified, protecting and his community.

It is also true that the applicant testified, thinking back with hindsight, that maybe because of his youthfulness at that stage he would have maybe decided otherwise.  What I'm trying to say is that maybe his subjective decision-making process at that stage was influenced by all these factors and could have influenced him by a pre-emptive attack and by attacking people that may not have been the real culprits.",
