            "Please proceed.\nMR MBANE\n\"We went from Vlakplaas as a unit, we came to Durban, CR Swart.  When we arrived in CR Swart, we stayed for about three days.  We would patrol in town.  On this third day, if I'm not mistaken, I was called together with Simon Radebe and Dube.\n\t\tWe were introduced to one man who had an injured leg.  We were then told that this man had an information that there were four terrorists in the township, in KwaMashu township.  So this man was supposed to show us this house where these terrorists were staying.\n\t\tI, together with Dube and Radebe, who was the driver, and together with this man who was going to show us this place.  Radebe stopped the car on the way and dropped us on the way.  I think about one kilometre or less than a kilometre to this place.  We then left with this man and then he introduced us as his comrades in this house.  He went to this house.\n\t\tWe told the deceased that we were coming from outside, we just wanted to see how the other comrades were working.  He told us that there were problems and there was one man who had a problem concerning accommodation and he was not safe where he was staying, but she would go and tell him that there are other comrades from outside who were in that house.  So we agreed upon that.\n\t\tWe made an appointment with her to meet on the following day.  We went back and then we found Radebe at the place where we left him.  We went into the car and we gave him a report-back of what happened.  We left, we went back to CR Swart.  \n\t\tWhen we arrived there, Radebe gave a report to the white people who were our seniors.  They called me and Dube and this other guy who had plaster of paris and we told them that we were, they accepted us in that house and we told them that we had to find something that would assure them that we were coming from outside.\n\t\tWe were then to get weapons from the Eastern Bloc, a Makarov and AKs.  We got them and then we put them in a bag.  The following day at night ...  There's something that I forgot.  Ntombi gave me the phone numbers where I should contact her and she also said that that was a well known place, that house.  So I phoned her and I told her that we were coming and I asked whether she had organised this person that needed accommodation to be there, and she said that we must not talk those things over the telephone.\n\t\tWhen we went there, Radebe again dropped us nearby, because we had not introduced him to Ntombi, so when we arrived I told her to put this bag in the bedroom in a safe place.  She then took the bag and I told her that there is another man who is helping us in connection with transport and we had left that man in a certain place, we did not want to bring him because he was not aware of what we were doing, but he was helping us with transport.  So she said that that is not a problem, we can bring this man to the house.\n\t\tI sent Dube to go and call Radebe, where he stopped the car.  Dube came with Radebe.  We parked the car outside and we introduced him as our sympathiser and as the driver of the transport that we were using.  We then said to Radebe we were welcomed in the house, so we asked him to go and buy some drinks, so that we can drink.\n\t\tThe deceased organised and Radebe took out some money, but I can't remember how much.  The deceased then left, she sent a child to go and buy some liquor, then that child came back and we drank.  And we found out that she was not able to get these men that needed accommodation, so we went back to CR Swart.\n\t\tI then suggested that because we go in and out of CR Swart, we would not know that someone maybe is following us, maybe someone in the area would follow us and then that person would be surprised because we said we were terrorists, so what were we doing in the police station.  I suggested that we find another place to stay.  Botha and Coetzee, they said that we had to get another place to stay, they would try and organise that.\n\t\tOn the third day we did not go back there.  We were told not to go out of the base, to remain in the base until we get a place to stay.  We stayed the whole day in the base.  On the fourth day we were told to take our clothes, because accommodation was found.\"\n...(intervention)",

We drove to Winkelspruit.  At that time I did not know that that area was Winkelspruit.  When we arrived there, we also canvass tents, we then build a house with those and then we also had food, groceries.\n\t\tThat same night, Dube and I and this other man who was operating with us at that time, we went back to Ntombi.  When we arrived there we asked how things were and then she said that she found this man that was looking for accommodation, but since it was at night, she would not be able to go and fetch him, because he was staying in squatter camps.  We then said that we would come back the following day, but we did not want to frequent that house, because she told us that that house was already suspected.  She then said that if we would come during the day it would be better.  If I'm not mistaken, it was on a Saturday, but I'm not sure about that.\n\t\tOn Saturday we arrived there at about four.  We arrived at about four and when we arrived there we were together with Radebe.  When we arrived, I went with Ntombi, we went to a certain corner, we stood there and she left me for about two or three minutes.  When she came back, she came back with this man, but I can't remember his name, because we were calling each other comrades.\n\t\tI was introduced to this comrade.  We then decided to go to the house, we did not want to chat on the street.  We went back to Ntombi's house.  When we arrived there we asked him questions, Dube and I, asked him questions, because Radebe was not that involved, he was helping us with transport and with money.

I then asked him that since he was from Zambia and he came through front line States, was he armed.  He said yes, he was armed.  I then said that it would be better if we take those arms with him and leave with him.  And at that time Radebe was not saying anything as the person who was not aware of anything.\n\t\tI then called Dube outside, I asked him what to do in that situation.  We then decided to leave this man behind and to come back the following day to fetch him, so that we can arrange a place for him to stay, we cannot leave him that time.  We wanted to do this, so that we can report to our seniors that we had found this person and the arms were there.\n\t\tWe stayed for a while and at night we went back to Winkelspruit and I told them in Winkelspruit that we found this man, he was trained and he knew the language that was used outside and he also had weapons.  They then asked why we left him behind.  We then said that we decided to leave him behind and to go to them and report first.  We were then told that the following day we had to fetch him and than arrangements were made, because I was not familiar with Durban at time.\n\t\tWe spent the night in Winkelspruit.  On the following day, at night, I phoned during the day and I told Ntombi to arrange so that when we got there we find this man there, so that we can go and fetch the weapons and take him to a safe place.\n\t\tI think it was on a Sunday, if I'm not mistaken.  I can't remember the days well, because this happened a long time ago.  On Sunday we arrived there, we found this man, we went with him to a squatter camps in Inanda, I think it was in Inanda, but I'm not sure, in the squatter camps.\n\t\tWhen we arrived there this man took out, AK, Makarov, grenades, two or three, but two of those had detonators and one did not have a detonator.  He took them out and then he took his clothes, we went with him, we drove with him.\n\t\tOn the way we stopped on a false roadblock.  When we arrived there, we knew that it was a false roadblock.  We handed him over to the white men.  We then left, we went to sleep.\n\t\tOn the following day I was told to go and fetch a car, a Corolla at CR Swart.  Radebe then took us to CR Swart.  When we arrived in CR Swart with Radebe and Dube and this other man, Gipsbeen, Simon got a watch, this guy's watch and I was given a bag.  Dube took clothes and this other man also took clothes of this guy.  We were given these items when we were in CR Swart.\n\t\tI then said to Radebe, \"This shows that they had finished with this guy, they had killed him, because we were given the items that belonged to him.\"  That was according to my perception. \n\t\tAfter two or three days I went back to Ntombi, I told her that the guy is safe, there is no problem, he is in a safe place.  Ntombi then said that there is another man who also has a problem, this man has got items in a certain place and he would like these things to be fetched and she also said that she would like to introduce this man to us.\n\t\tWe left with her to Lamontville, or to Chesterville, I'm not sure.  When we arrived there, Ntombi went in and she left us behind.  This man came, by the name of Sbu.  Sbu introduced himself and we also introduced ourselves to him.  He told us that he had weapons in the Transkei and he wanted those weapons to be fetched.  He then asked about transport and then I told him that Radebe was the one who was helping us out concerning transport.  We then told him that we would see him the following day.\n\t\tWe went back to the base and we gave a report-back.  We were then told to see what to do, because it was impossible for us to go to the Transkei.  On the following day we went back to him, driving a Corolla, not a kombi this time.  There was an RPG7, AK, and we all had Makarovs, so that this man can also see that we were also armed and there were also shells of the RPG7, but I can't remember how many there were.\n\t\tWe met this man nearby his residence.  We then requested that we move from that area to another place, so that we can discuss these things.  We decided to go to Ntombi.  We bought liquor when we arrived there and we had gained confidence of this man, he trusted us.  We then said that we discussed this Transkei issue.  This man then showed us his friends, Zimba, that was together with him in the struggle.  \n\t\tWe went back to the base at night.  The following day we reported back to our seniors about what happened.  We were told to gather some more information, to find out if he's got some more information.  We were with this man for about a week and we'd contact Ntombi every day, visit her or phone her.\n\t\tOn another day we were told to bring Sbu with us.  We took a kombi, it was myself, Simon, Dube, the there of us.  This other guy who had a plaster of paris was not with us on that occasion.  We took him and we were told to take him to the base.  We made sure that we cover his eyes.  We found him next to Kentucky Fried Chicken, because we did not want to pick him up at home.  \n\t\tWe found him there, we took him to our seniors.  We told him that we did not want him to see where we were going.  We then handed him over to the white men.  That was the last time I saw him and I concluded that they had killed him.  And we did not ask any questions about the whereabouts of this man.\n\t\tWe stayed in the base, if I'm not mistaken I think about four to five weeks and I would see Ntombi.  Ntombi again gave us another man, I don't know his name.  When we took this man to the base and I could see that he did not trust us, he wanted to cause problems for us.  We told him that we were terrorists and we can kill, so if he wanted to see that we are able to kill, he will see.\n\t\tThe fact that this man was killed, that was not planned, it just happened.  He was shot, he died and we left his body next to the hotel.  That was a busy area, we thought that maybe people would think that we were fighting, drinking alcohol and fighting and then somebody shot him, so we left him there.\n\t\tWe would see Ntombi now and again and she told us that there were another four comrades that arrived.  She was worried that she did not know where the other three were, so she wanted to see at least of them, one of the three.  We said that that was not a problem, if she wanted to see them, we would arrange that to happen. \n\t\tWe reported back to your seniors, we said that there were four people that were around, but Ntombi is not going to show us these people before she could see one of the three that she handed over to us.  So we thought that she was suspecting something.  We were told to bring Ntombi, because she did not want to show us the other four comrades.  \n\t\tWe also had our own meeting, decided that this would be dangerous if we can go straight to the house to fetch her, because if she would disappear after these three people had disappeared.  So we thought that it would be better if she would come to us, meet with her at the station or the taxi rank.  We agreed.  I phoned her and I asked her to meet us at the Durban station.  She agreed and she told me which clothes she would be wearing and I told her that I would be driving with a white Corolla.  Sometimes it would be sky blue, sometimes it would be white.  The colour of this car used to change frequently.\"\n...(intervention)",
