<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a>	Mr Ngcobo, is it correct that you are still at this stage serving a life imprisonment sentence at the Westville Prison in Durban?  Did you hear the question?</p>

<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Yes.  It is a rural area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> This area, was it still under the tribal structures?  What I mean by that is inkosis, indunas, tribal policemen and so forth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Yes.  It is under the chief.  There are also indunas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> The South Coast area, Harding, Port Shepstone, iZingolweni, that area, is that still the situation today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Yes, it is still the same.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> When you grew up there, were you taught in the traditional customs of the Zulu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Yes, I grew under the Zulu culture.  This means that I believe in traditional set up, like in being under the chiefs and indunas.  I believe in everything made by a Zulu, that is customary.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Did you go to school?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Yes, partially.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> When you left school, what did you do?</p>

<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In what year did you leave school?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> I cannot remember when I left school.  It is long time ago, in the 70's.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Is it also correct that you were the youth leader at iZingolweni?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> And iZingolweni is between Port Shepstone and Harding?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> How did it come to be that you became to be involved in politics?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He hasn't said that he has become involved in politics, he just said that he was a youth leader.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> A youth leader.  Well can you just explain to the Commission what does being a youth leader entail?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> It means bringing the youth in your area together, for the political party you in, and show them the way that they have to live as young people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who elected you as the youth leader?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> By the youth itself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> In 1989.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> For how long were you supposed to be, was it for one year or two years or six months?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> That was not said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was there a constitution that elected you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> We were working under the chairmanship of the late Zulu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He was chairman of what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> He was just a chairman of the Izingolweni area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You haven't told us what organisation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> My organisation is the IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is this a branch of the IFP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I'm sorry about this but I'd just like this picture cleared up.  He was chairman of the branch of the IFP, what branch is this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> I was in the youth and Mr Zulu was a chairman of the whole community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, no but I'm talking about chairman of what area, what town, what place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Zulu was in Emndeni and I was in Nkulu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Chairman, your chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Izingolweni in Emndeni.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, my question is that Mr Zulu was the chairman and what to know of which area he was the chairman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> He was a Chairman in iZingolweni in Emndeni area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Thank you.  Just to clarify that point, iZingolweni is a very big area, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> And iZingolweni is divided in several Wards?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Like the Nkulu Ward, Shobashobane and so on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Were you a youth leader of one of these Wards or the whole area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> I was in Nkulu and Mdalane.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How many leaders were there with you in that area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> It was Zulu, and Njobo Cele.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Anybody else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Mbambo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So they occupied the same position that you occupied, they were leaders like you were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> They were in their own areas because there are 8 places.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Who was your superior?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Late Zulu was my leader and he was followed by Sipho who is now arrested, and James Zulu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I didn't hear the answer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> My brother who is now arrested in Pietermaritzburg.  James Zulu was in charge of the whole area.  James is outside here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Just to clarify that to the Commission, the leader of the South Coast at that time for the IFP was James Zulu, for the whole South Coast?</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> During the time 1991, the early '90's there was a lot of turmoil and violence in the South Coast, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Yes.  There was a lot of violence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> What was the reason for this according to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> ANC and IFP were fighting for control of the place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Were there ever attacks on the IFP dominated areas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Yes, there were lots of attacks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Was there any attacks on ANC people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Yes.  Although at a certain stage I ran away and looked for refuge at the Police Station in Izingolweni.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> At one stage your mother was killed, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> When was this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> I think it was in 1990 or 1991.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Can you tell the Commission briefly what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> When I was staying in the police station, people came and threatened me there.  They said they would kill me if I ever go out of the station.  The station commander Mr Le Roux told me that it is better to work than stay in the station because I was eating prisoner's food.  I argued with him about that because I told him that I was supplied food by my mother.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a>My brother Sipho who was renting two shops at that time then visited me.  He said I must use one of his shops, which I did.  One day, during the day, the boys I was not getting along with then arrived.  At that time my brother had been told that these boys wanted to attack the said shop.  My brother then suggested that I leave that shop because it was not safe, and go to the other shop where I could be able to see people who wanted to attack me.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a>	When I arrived at that shop, I received a message that these boys had already attacked the shop I had just left, and shot the boys they found there, assaulted my brother's wife and looted the shop.  They then ran away,  They had been seen doing this because it was in broad daylight and they were known.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...[inaudible] a little slowly please.  Can the interpreter please interpret in such a way that we don't hear his voice and his voice at the same time?  It's a bit difficult to hear the interpretation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a>	You were telling us that you went to the other shop and what happened at the other shop?</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> When they arrived at this shop I had left, they looted it, assaulted my brother's wife and asked where I was.  They were afraid to go to this other shop. Thereafter my mother came to the shop and asked me whether these people who were looking for me had arrived there.  My mother then sat down and asked for a cool drink and some bread, something she never did before.  I gave it to her.  She then asked me to be at home that evening because it was New Year's Eve.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you say your mother came, where was it that she had come to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> At this other shop where I was.  I then went home that evening.  As I was supposed to keep guard to my father's shop at night, I went there after I had supper.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a>	At midnight, when people celebrated the New Year, I hear an explosion coming from my houses direction.  When I looked at my house, I saw it was on fire.  I then called few boys and asked them to come with me, to find out what was happening at my house.  On my way, I found my sister lying on the ground, injured.  She told me that she was shot, and that I would never see my mother alive again.  I left her lying there and rushed home.  When I arrived there, I found that my mother was trapped in a burning hut.  I took her out of that hut and put blanket around her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a>	Another house nearby also caught fire, but I did not go there as the people that stayed there had already fled.  The police did not come that night until the next day.  They took me and my mother to the mortuary, and I explained to them how she was attacked.  I then waited for her funeral because there were rumours that the person who was supposed to have been killed was me and not her and this was because I was already on the run.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How was your mother killed, what did she die of, because when you said you went to the hut and she hadn't been killed?  You took her out of the hut and then?  You haven't told us what caused her death.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, please proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Oh, she was shot and not burnt.  When I arrived there she was already dead and they just wanted to burn the corpse.  I told the police that there were threats and something bad would be done to me after my mother's burial.  On the day of the funeral, I saw a group of people standing far from us, keeping us under observation.  They did not come near us.  Violence was still rampant at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Which different political groups?</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> It was between members of the IFP and the ANC, in different areas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, do carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> There is a fence on one side of my house and after we buried my mother, we picked up a cap belonging to another boy I knew.  His name is Dan Cele.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just tell me, where did you pick up this cap?</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> It was in the garden not far from my house.  It means that is where they were hiding, waiting for the midnight so that they could attack my house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So now whose name was written on the cap?</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> There was nobody's name.  I know that it belonged to Dan Cele because his brother was an IFP member and Dan was an ANC member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> How did you know the cap belonged to Dan Cele?</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> When we were standing in the police station with his brother, Dan was brought by the police there after he was arrested.  He was wearing the same cap.  We tried to tell him to stop what he was doing and he promised to stop.  Yet he is the one who attacked us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you say that he came to attack your place, what you really mean is that you found his cap there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Yes.  That is why I decided to look for him because I knew how dangerous he was.  I had binoculars that I usually used to get their whereabouts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> How did you know that Dan Cele was a dangerous man, why do you say that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> He had killed a lot of people in the area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You had seen him do it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> They were doing this in broad daylight.  They used to arrest and try people in the kangaroo courts.  Even when I was with the police, I saw their group assaulting people and I mentioned this to the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, my question is this, had you seen Dan Cele with your own eyes doing anything that amounted to an attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> I had never been near where they were doing these things, but he was always present where things were happening.  Whenever they got drunk, they used to boast and praise themselves about these things.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> You had binoculars?</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Yes.  The binoculars were taken by the police.  I used to check how many were they, and if they were many, I used not to attack them.  If, however, I see that he is alone, I would then attack that person.  On this day I ambushed Dan.  I was driving a car and hid near the shop.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> What happened then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> It was a few days after my mother's funeral.  I was looking for him because after my brother's shop was destroyed, I could no longer stay in the area.  I once stayed in iNkosi Dlamini's area, and thereafter I went to Luthuli's place.  I used to go back to the area at night and attack whoever I get, and retreat to my hiding place again.  I did this because I wanted to popularise my party because it was diminishing as we were being killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you say: "On this particular day", what particular day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> I cannot say which particular day. I think it was after my mother's funeral, but I cannot say how long after that funeral.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> ...[inaudible] proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> I found Dan at his house.  I had seen him through my binoculars when he went to his house, and I followed him.  I found him with his blind grandfather.  When I got into the house, he looked for something under the bed to scare me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you go alone to Dan's house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> No, I was with another boy, Dodo Mbambo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why did you go to Dan's house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> I wanted to find out whether the cap did belong to him, and who actually killed my mother.  He told me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> What did he tell you happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> He told me that there were many of them who killed my mother, and he mentioned names of people I knew and did not know.  When I asked for reasons, he told me that they were actually looking for me and decided to kill my family so that I could be lured to come back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> What happened then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> I told the old man I am taking his grandson with me, which I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You pulled him out of the house or did you ask him to accompany you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> I took him away.  I had a firearm and he had nothing. I told him that he had to come with me. I said he could run away if he wanted to. I think he came along because I had a firearm and he was afraid. I did not drag him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Where did you go?</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> We went to Oribi Gorge, where we sat down.  I asked him for the names of all the people who were present when my mother was attacked, and he mentioned the names.  Later, however, I met some of the people he mentioned in prison, and they denied taking part in this attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you say he gave you a list of them, are you saying he had a piece of paper on which the names were written?.</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> I had a piece of paper and a pen. I was writing the names down as he was mentioning them to me. He gave me a lot of names and I did not know some of the people he mentioned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> What did you do then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> After Dan gave me all the names, I told him that because we were opposing each other politically, he must also feel what the people who he killed felt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR  DE KLERK:</span> What did you do then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> I took out  a ,32 revolver that I had, and shot him on his head. I then left him there. I got into my car and drove off.</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why did you not take him to the police instead of killing him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> I did not think about that. The situation was very bad at that time...</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, I'm not talking about the situation.  You knew this man, you knew where he lived, you knew his brother, you go there with a gun in your car, why didn't you take him to the police station?</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> I did not think about that at that time. I just thought of killing him because we were not belonging to the same party. And this happened after his brother, who was my best friend, had been killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do I understand that there are people in that area that are divided into groups but you're a respectable leader of your people, you arrested a man whom you knew.  You could have taken him to the police and handed him to the police.  Was it because you had been used to killing other people that it didn't matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> I never thought of killing a person when I grew up, but the way I was feeling at that time made me react on impulse.</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, there can't be an impulse because you took the trouble in going in your car, you knew where he was, you told his grandfather you are taking him, so that can't be an impulse.  You went there, you knew what you were going to do, so that is not an impulse, it was all planned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> There were many things happening in my life at that time. I had lost my mother, and there was a lot of political differences with other people. When all such things happen in you life, they make you something else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Mr Ngcobo, in that time did people of the two parties, ANC and IFP people, did it ever happen that they killed each other merely for the fact that the other person was of an opposition party?  Did that ever happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> There were many things happening at that time.  There were also innocent people who were killed because they were pointed out as belonging to a certain political party.</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, but you didn't kill this man because he belonged to a political group, you killed him because you thought that he was one of those that killed your mother.  That was the purpose wasn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> That is not true.  Even if he had not killed my mother, there was fighting going on there.  He wanted to kill me as much as I also wanted to kill him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So if you get a feeling that somebody is going to kill you and if you'd get a chance you'd kill them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> At present, no, because I have now seen a lot of things.  That is why I decided to come here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, do carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> After you'd killed Mr Dan Cele, that was the first count of murder in your trial that you were also convicted of.  The second count, you were also convicted on that count, was regarding a matter on the 16th of March 1991, it was near Umthini bus stop iZingolweni and you killed Thulani Dlamini, what happened there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> On that day, I remember that I was with Mhlathi Mbambo.  These boys were waiting for the bus that was bringing ANC members in their area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You say you think that they were waiting ...[inaudible] or they were ...[inaudible]</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> There are spies all over who report what would be happening at a certain place at a certain time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a> CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, do carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> So you had information, what did you do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> After getting this message, we approached  these boys in the afternoon.  They did not see us approaching them, only when we were very near.  We took out our firearms and shot at them.  This Dlamini boy was left behind when others ran away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You say: "We went and shot", did you shoot Dlamini?</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And who else did you shoot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Mhlathi Mbambo.  That is how we called him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Who was with you Mr Ngcobo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> I was with Mhlathi Mbambo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Why did you kill this person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> This Dlamini boy was from the ANC area. We believed that they were the IFP enemies and that is why I shot him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> So if I understand you correctly, the mere fact that that person was ANC you killed him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Dlamini was from the ANC area and we regarded him as one of them.  That is why we shot at them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So if you went along the road at any time and saw people and you thought they were ANC you would have killed them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Yes, because I was building my party and they were building theirs.  Things were tough.</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I'm talking about at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> At that time, it depended on whether that person is involved in doing bad things or not.  If that was the case I would shoot that person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You know in that area, how would you know who was involved in attacks when these things happened so haphazardly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> These people were attacking in groups during the day and night, and they were known.</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Mr Ngcobo, do I understand you correct that when you received information that this was a person that may be involved in attacks on you you acted on that information?</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> No.  We ascertained first whether the story was true or not because people used to label other people just because they hated them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What did you ask Mr Dlamini, did you accuse him of having attacked you, before you killed him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> No, I did not ask him.  If I found him alone, I would not have done anything.  But because they were a group, I decided to attack them before they attacked me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If you saw a group of three people at a bus stop, how would you know whether they were ANC or whether they belonged to no political party at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Many times I would find that these people do not belong to any party.  But youngsters, they were all politically involved and I was not killing old people.  I was trying to crush these heads before they crushed me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> What ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Sorry, may I just ask - sorry Mr de Klerk, did you know Mr Dlamini at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> I would not lie.  I did not know him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Does the name Thokozani Shazi known to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Who is that? Is he dead or is he still alive?</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> He is one of the persons who fled from the bus stop and was injured, it was alleged in the charge sheet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> No. I did not know him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr Ngcobo, did you know any of the people at the bus stop?</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> No.  I did not know them.  The person who knew them was this person who came from the same area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was Mbambo charged with you in the Supreme Court in the murder trial?</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> He never appeared in court.</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you killed a man whom you didn't even know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Yes, it happened at a bad time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> What did you want to gain from this killing Mr Ngcobo?  What did you think was going to happen when you do this, how were you going to help anybody?</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> I realise now the bad things that I did.  At that time, however, I wanted to gain popularity for my party, the IFP .  I was not killing everybody at random.  I used to persuade some of the people to join my party.</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Did you receive instructions from any person or superior that instructed you specifically - I actually forgot to ask also about Dan Cele, to instruct you to go and kill Dan Cele or to go and instruct you to kill Xolani Dlamini?</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> No. I would not start lying now because I am arrested.  Zulu never instructed me kill.  He only told me how to run the party and I was transgressing what he was telling me.  I was doing this on my own volition and for my party.</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In other words you were not ordered by anybody to do so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And after killing people did you have to report to anybody that you had killed people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> As a youth leader I did not want them to know what I was doing.  I preached peace when I was with them, but do my own things when I was alone during the night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Why didn't you practice peace, why did you decided to take the other route, the violent route?</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> I preached peace on the one hand, and tried to build my party on the other. People were scattered all over and I was trying to bring them together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> On that specific day, the 16th of March 1991, as was pointed out by the Commissioner and during your criminal trial, there was a charge of attempted murder that you tried to kill Thokozani Shazi, Geoffrey Sandile Ncane or Babazani Shezi.  What happened, did you only shoot at Xolani Dlamini or did you also shoot at other people?  	So what happened, did you only shoot at Xolani Dlamini or did you also shoot at other people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> I shot at Dlamini and the others ran away.  I then finished him off.</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Did you shoot at any of the other people that ran away, or in their direction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> I think they ran away when I was finishing this other one off.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Mr Ngcobo, you said you shot at Dlamini and now you say that you had to finish off the one who was left, are you suggesting that you shot at him more than once?</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> I think I shot him more than once because he fell in a furrow.  This happened long ago and I cannot be expected to remember everything, especially after being sentenced to death.</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Count number four in your criminal trial was also a charge of murder of which you were convicted, that happened on the 24th of March 1991 at the Mtateni bus stop and there you killed Thembinkosi Wellington Mauti Ngcobo, what happened there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Yes. Mauti and the other boys were popularly known as "boys from Six".  They were the main perpetrators of violence in that area, and they were killing people from my party.  We never met each other before, but we came across each other on that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you say: "We came across them", would you tell me who it was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> I was with Nomacandane Shazi on that day.  We saw them when they were still far, and hid ourselves.  When they came nearer, I came out and called Mauti.  He came towards me, and when he realised that I was the wrong person, he tried to run away.  I shot him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Can you remember how many times you shot him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> I cannot remember, but he died on the spot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a> MR DE KLERK:   Can you remember which firearm you used?</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> I cannot remember whether it was a 765.</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Why did you kill him, what was your main reason?</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> He was my political opponent because he was mobilising for ANC support and I was doing it for IFP.  That is the only thing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Mr Ngcobo, are you suggesting that there was no conflict between the two of you but you each wanted to mobilise that your group or each other's group should get support, not actually conflict that you clashed in some way but because you wanted to gain support?</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Political differences were the only reason, and this started after the release of the President.  The ANC started killing people and we started defending ourselves.  ANC members, however, were not arrested even when culprits were known.  They killed us and we killed them, and this developed to a competition.</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I haven't a word from you about how, when you saw these people whom you looked upon as ANC, you were armed, you didn't take them to the police you just decided to kill.  You haven't said a word that the people you killed were armed in any way and yet without them being armed you just killed them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> When there is a war you attack the unarmed.  You cannot attack an armed person who might injure you.  You have to trap a defenceless person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Mr Ngcobo, you've said several times now, you used the word: "war", at that stage how did you perceive that, a normal situation that if somebody does something wrong you would take him to the police and hopefully he will convicted in Court or how did you perceive the reality of that area at that stage in the early 1990's?</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> I did not understand the police at Izingolweni.  They did not attend timeously to the complaints of attacks and they did not attend any complaints during the night.  They only visited the scenes the following day.  These people were also afraid of ANC members.  It is because these members had strong attorneys who defended them, and the police were afraid for their lives.</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   You don't seem to have made any efforts at calling upon the police at any time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> I called the police when I was attacked in my brother's shop. I did that after I had realised that the way I was doing things was not taking me anywhere. I then looked for police protection and told them who were the people who had attacked me at that time. Those people were then arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> So, when...</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Then on count five of your criminal trial you were charged of a charge of murder, that on the 19th of May 1991 at the Dlovinga area at iZingolweni you killed Muntuza Sgadlane Titiza Cele.</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Who are those people?.</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> ...[inaudible] it was count number five at your criminal trial, it was a count of murder and you were also convicted of this charge on the 19th of May at the Dlovinga Ward, Dlovinga area, iZingolweni you killed Muntuza Sgadlane Titiza Cele and on the same day same area, Thomas Mfanafuthi Blose.  On the same day in the same area Goodwill Mxolisi Cele.  On the same day, the 19th you were also charged and convicted of the attempted murder at the same Dlovinga Ward of Maxwell Zulu and/or his other name, Fana Milton Cele.  Do you remember that now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Yes. I remember now. I was from the wedding. It was Sunday. When I arrived at the taxis, I found my brother's son Sandile. He told me that Mfanafuthi went to my house and said they thought that I had died. They left a message to say that they would get hold of me. I know Mfanafuthis very well and that they had left the area because of violence. I asked this boy where the Mfanafuthis were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I'm sorry, what was your brother's son's name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Sandile.</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Before you proceed, just explain to the Commission how did you know Mfanafuti Blose?  What did you know about his activities, what information did you have about him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Mfanafuthi Blose was a very well known comrade.</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> As what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> As ANC supporter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Did you have any information regarding his activities?  Was he just a normal person sitting at home or what did he do according to your information?</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> He was always involved.  I know many ANC supporters who were not involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I can't hear the translation please.  Can the answer be repeated?  Can the answer be repeated because I can't hear the interpretation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> I said Mfanafuthi was well known as the perpetrator of violence.  I also said I know many other ANC supporters who were not involved in violence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Well, your brother's son now gave you information that Mfanafuthi passed your house, what did you do then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> I decided to look for these people because it was during the day.  I then called other IFP supporters like Dodo Mbambo, Macandane Shazi and Mshengu.  I asked the small boy to tell my friends what was said.  We then went to Hlophe's house where these boys were.  I met the father Hlophe outside, and I greeted him very politely.  I asked him where the boys were and he showed me the hut.  I went there, and on my way I met his wife.  I also politely greeted her and asked the same question.  She showed me where the boys were.  I found about five boys there.  I then said to them; "Sithombe that you were looking for is now here." The people who were accompanying me did not enter the hut.  I then started shooting.  Pandemonium took place, with some of them trying to hide under the bed.  I shot and shot until I was satisfied, and then I left the scene.</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Sorry, may I interrupt?  I can't hear the translation, it's too soft and simultaneous with the evidence here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a>	Mr Ngcobo, just start again.  You enter the hut - and please explain to the Commission fully as you remember it, what happened in that hut?  How many shots did you fire, can you remember which firearm you had with you, what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> When I got into the kraal, I met the elders.  After greeting them, I asked them where the boys were and they showed me.  When I got there, I told then that Sithombe that they were looking for had arrived.  They stood up to run out of the hut, and I started shooting.  I do not know how many times I shot, but three people died.  One Zulu, got injured and the other one ran away unscathed.  I felt bad, because there are two others, namely a Cele boy who was schooling at Ulundi, and Maxwell Zulu, who I killed unintentionally.</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just give me the names of those who were injured unintentionally.</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> It was Cele, I cannot remember his first name, and Maxwell Zulu.  They were just there to smoke dagga and were never involved in this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So why did you not just shoot the one you were looking for?  I'm not saying that you ought to have done it in the first place but if you were determined to shoot, why didn't you just shoot the man?</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> When I arrived there, I had seen this boy Cele the previous day.  We talked and he introduced himself as Cele boy from Ulundi.  I did not know him that well.  I also did not know Maxwell Zulu well.  When they stood up, I thought they wanted to get out from the door where I was.  I then shot randomly to push them back in.  I feel very pity for the parents of these two boys because it was not my intention to kill them.  Even if they say they do not pardon me, there is nothing I can do.  I know that they lost their beloved ones, and I am the cause of that.  I was, however, attacking my enemies, not intending to kill these two.</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> You say that you were after your enemies, what would you have gained - I have to ask you again, what would you have gained by this specific incident and did you receive any orders to go and do this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> When they said they were looking for me, they wanted to kill me so that their party would prosper, and I was doing the same for my party.  There were rumours that I had died, and when they discovered that I was still alive, they wanted to get me.  I do not want to die, that is why I attacked first.</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr Ngcobo, could I just take you back to the names of these individuals.  Did I hear you correctly saying that the two people that were injured were young boys?  Were the others adults, the people that were killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> No.  They were not that young.  They were no longer young boys.</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Who were you specifically looking for?  You said you were not looking for these two young boys but they were accidentally there, who were you looking for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> I was looking for Mfanafuthi Blose who had said he would get me.  This meant also his friends.  I would not leave him behind.</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did you know who the people were with them?  Did they tell you the names of the people with them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> I found that the other boys were Hlophe's boys, and I do not know whether Mfanafuthis's brother was also there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you say you found out, this was after the event you found out who the others were but not at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> He mentioned boys from Hlophe's house and Mfanafuthi.  He did not mention the other two boys, Maxwell Zulu and Cele.</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> During this - if we can maybe just stop at this, during these killings that took place where you were involved, was the only killings that took place in this area or were there also other attacks that you know about, from any side?  The reason why I'm asking this, was there other violence except these murders?</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The days when he was involved?</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> In that time period.</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In that time period?</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Yes, there was a lot of violence going on.  I do not know whether I can mention the names of all the people who were killed in the area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> And there are people that died on both sides, ANC and IFP people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> I mean the IFP supporters.  The ANC supporters are those who were killed by me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> ...[inaudible] there were IFP people killed in that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> There are many I know.  In my area alone, I know of six people.  there are some others from other areas, and there is one family where all the members were killed because they were accused of witchcraft.</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> You don't have to say all the names but was it a lot of people or just one or two?</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> That is what happened because the police are also aware of it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> All this is absolutely hearsay isn't it?  We can't just carry on and on on that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> I won't lead it further.</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Okay, be it as it may, there was a lot of violence.  Okay, on the count nine that was a count of murder on which you were convicted.  On the 7th of June 1991 iZingolweni, you killed Kehla Mshikashika Mkhize, do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Yes.  I remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> What happened on that day, the 7th of June 1991?</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> This very young boy was a problem to me because one day he approached me at the rank and told me that he had heard that me brother Sipho had hired me in his shop.  He said if my brother did not want to see a bad thing happening, he should chase me away from his shop.  This surprised me because Sipho is my brother and he could not be told to chase me away.  He was one of the people who attacked our shop and he was wearing a pinafore.  This happened in broad daylight and he was a real problem.  A spoilt child.  One day in the afternoon, I walked down the river and I was with Phewa.  I went to Mshikashika's house and found young kids there.  I asked then where Mshikashika was and they showed me the hut.  I went there and found the door slightly open.  Mshikashika was with his mother inside.  When he saw me, he knew what was happening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What was going on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> He was me big enemy.  We were attacking each other.  He ran away, and as he was running...</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a>	His mother just ran away because she saw me attacking her son, for the wrongs he had done. </p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> If you say you finished him off, does it mean that you shot him again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Yes, I think so.  I shot him again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Did you receive any orders to kill this man?</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> It was our own political fight.</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Count number 10 ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think it might be a convenient stage to take the adjournment now.  The Committee will adjourn now and resume at two o'clock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS </p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> I am ready Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">GOODMAN NGCOBO:</span> (still under oath)</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR DE KLERK:</span> (continued)   Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Ngcobo, now we come with count 10 during your criminal trial, that was a count of attempted murder on the 25th of June 1991 at Ngcwangusheni area, iZingolweni.  You were charged that you unlawfully killed Mgabiselwa Elliot Ndlovu.  Attempted murder, that you attempted to kill him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> I did not do that.  That is a big mistake. I did not touch that person and I even pleaded not guilty during my trial.  I did not know how I was sentenced.  the investigating officer in this case even told me that he knew that I did not commit this crime, but he could do nothing because the case was already in court at Scottburgh.  I did not do anything to this man, and I do not even know where his house is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Do you know, or did you receive any information of who was involved in that killing, that means who the killer was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> There was no killer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Attempted killer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> I heard from Mhlathi Mbambo that he is the one who attacked this man.  They had their own differences which were not politically related.  This was an old man and I do not know anything about his political affiliation.  I only knew him as an inyanga and belonging to the Zion Church.</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Then if we move on to count 11, that is a charge of murder.  On the 26th of June 1991, the same area, Ngcwangusheni area, you were charged that you killed Sifiso Moses Mbhele.  You were not convicted on that charge.  Were you any way involved in that case on that incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> I do not even know that person</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Then there was a matter on the 28th of June 1991, at Ndlovinga area, iZingolweni.  There you were charged that you killed Siyabonga Elson Mvundla.  You were also not convicted on that charge.  Were you involved in that incident on the 28th of June 1991?</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> No.  I do not even know that person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Count 13 during the criminal trial, that was regarding a matter on the 28th of June 1991, that will be the same day as count 12, also at Ndlovinga area.  You were charged with attempted murder of Thami Norman Gama.  Were you involved in that incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Is his surname Gama?  I cannot remember that person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> It was the same date as the previous charge, where you were found not guilty, you were also found not guilty on this charge.  His name was Thami Norman Gama and it also happened at Ndlovinga area on the 28th of June 1991.</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> No.  I do not remember that person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr De Klerk, are you on count 14 or 15?</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> 13.</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> 13.  Now we can move over to count 14, that was a charge of murder.  You were convicted on this charge.  On the 12th of July 1991, also at Ndlovinga area, iZingolweni you killed Doda Nxumalo, also known as Doda Nyawazi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Yes.  I remember that person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Can you tell the Commission what happened at that incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> I was with Dodo Mbambo on that day.  I saw this boy crossing the river and knew that he would run away once he saw me.  I then asked Dodo to emerge and talk to him.  Dodo did that.  He was also one of our attackers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Why do you say that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> He was one of the ringleaders and one of the powerful ones in the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> What happened then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Dodo talked to him and I had told Dodo to grab hold of him.  He freed himself from Dodo's grip and started to run away.  He outran Dodo, and I then shot him as he was running away.  He fell on the ground and I left him lying there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Did you receive any orders to kill this person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> No.  I killed him because I regarded him as one of the enemies.  Political enemies.</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Count 15 during the criminal trial, was a charge of murder.  You were found not guilty, but the charge was that on the 12th of July 1991 near Bandlana area, iZingolweni you killed Fana Mqadi.  Do you know anything about the killing of  Fana Mqadi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Fana Mqadi was one of my friends.  We belonged to the same party and there was no reason for me to kill him.  He might have been killed by our enemies but I cannot say by whom.</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Then there were two charges, 16 was unlawful possession of a firearm that you were in possession of a 7.65 mm pistol, Baretta without holding a license, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> That is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> And at the same time, this is now August 1991 that you were also in possession of ammunition, 13 rounds of ammunition for this firearm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Where did you get this firearm from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> I got the firearm from two people.  It was chairman Zulu and Ngcobo.  I cannot say who was the actual owner or the person who actually gave it to me because they were together when it was given to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, what was the name, Zulu what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Chairman Zulu and Meshack Ngcobo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Who were they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> They were IFP leaders.  Zulu was a chairman and the other one was his friend.  They were very close to each other.  This other one was also a leader but I do no know what his position was.  You would find him wherever you find Zulu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Why did you take this firearm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> I took the firearm for self defence.  This is the reason, in fact, why they gave it to me.  I did not use it as I was told, however, and I started doing my own things.  They were my leaders and I did not want them to know what I was doing in their backs.  I was however doing this to build my party.</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When did they give you this firearm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> I cannot remember the year, but it was still in the thick of violence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Then there was a count 18, also a count of murder.  You were not convicted on this charge, 13 September 1991, at  Ngcwangusheni area, that you killed Thulebona Patrick Nqangale.  Do you know anything about that incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> I do not know the families in Ngcwangusheni.  I know nothing about that.  The only murders I committed were ones I admitted in court and took the police at the scenes where these murders were committed.  There would be no reason, therefore, for me to admit certain crimes and deny others that I have committed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Maybe we can just explain that to the Commission quickly.  You were convicted after you made certain admissions to the Police and also took the Police to places where these incidents took place, where you killed the people, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> I was arrested in possession of a firearm in Merebank.  During their investigation in this matter, I decided to confess to the killings I had committed, and took the police to the scenes of these killings.  Nobody forced me to do this, but I just wanted the families of theses children to know what had happened to their kids.</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Then during the trial, you were charged also on a count 19, attempted murder on the 13th of September 1991, in Ngcwangusheni area, iZingolweni, that you there tried to kill Ntombintombi Patricia Cele, do you know anything about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> I know nothing about that.  I do not remember doing anything to a female because I respect woman a lot.  If I saw that the woman was doing something wrong, I preferred to tell her to leave the area instead of doing anything to her.  I respect woman, irrespective of their political affiliation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Count 20, that is also a count of attempted murder, you were not convicted.  The same date, the 13th of September 1991 near Ngcwangusheni area, iZingolweni, that you tried to kill a Wilson Mdundeni Nkonyeni.  Do you know anything about that incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> No I know nothing about that.  I do not even know that person or any family in Ngcwangusheni.</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Then there was a count 21, also a count of murder.   You were not convicted of that count of murder.  The 16th of October 1991, near Shobashobane, iZingolweni you killed Sipho Shadrack Ngcobo.  Do you know anything about that matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> I know nothing about that.  I did not even know Sipho Ngcobo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Then there was a count 22 of attempted murder.  You were also found not guilty on that charge, the 16th of October at Shobashobane.  It was said and alleged that you intentionally attempted to kill Florence Ngcobo.  Do you know anything about it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> As I said before, I never touched any woman.  I also did not do anything to her husband.  There was no reason why I would kill that person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Then there was a count 23, also a count of murder.  On the 22nd of October 1991 near Mndeni area, iZingolweni that you killed Deleka Christopher Ngidi, also known as Striker Mkhize.</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> On that day, I had gone to see my attorney in Port Shepstone town.  I was only told about what happened.  The court, however, decided to convict me even when I denied any knowledge about this matte.  It is true that Steleka was also one of my fiercest enemies because he was Mshikashika's brother, the person I mentioned before.  I would have done a terrible thing to him if I had met him, because he would have done the same to me.  But we never met.  I did not kill him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Count 24 also a count of murder on the same day, the 22nd of October 1991, the Mndeni area, iZingolweni.  You were charged and also convicted that you killed Thabani Ndlovu.  Do you know anything about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Thabani was Striker's brother-in-law.  They were known as killers.  As I said before, on that day I had gone to Port Shepstone to see my attorney and I did  not kill them.  I was only told that they had been murdered.</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What was the name of the person that you say Thabani Ndlovu was with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> No.  I know nothing about that.  They were my big enemies, but I never got them.  I wanted them, however, as much as they wanted me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> The last count, was the same day, attempted murder, 22nd of October 1991 and that Mndeni area.  You were charged that you attempted to kill Zwelaki Madonsela Mendu and Mfilela Elias Shange, do you know anything about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> No. I know nothing about their deaths. As I said before, I was looking for them as much as they were looking for me, but I did not get a chance to find them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> After this criminal trial was finalised, did this matter ever go on appeal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Yes.  I made an appeal.  This case you have just mentioned...  When the outcome of my appeal was announced, certain convictions, I do not remember whether they were four or five, were set aside.  My counsel during that trial, Mr Lingelfielder, might shed a light on that.  I was in the death row, you know, and one cannot be expected to comprehend everything that was happening then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> You received the death penalty, several death penalties and you then went to Pretoria, is that correct, to the Pretoria Central Prison?</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Yes.  I was sentenced to six death sentences and 36 years.  When the outcome of the appeal came back, I was told that certain convictions were set aside, but nothing was said about the sentences.  I am still serving those sentences.</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Is it correct that you were on death row for two years in Pretoria?</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Is it correct that while you are on death row, you were alone in one prison cell, you are kept alone?</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> While you were waiting to be executed, did you think about what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> I thought about all the crimes I had committed and realised how serious they were.  I told myself that these things have already happened, but I thought that I had to sit down with the people I had done wrong to, and asked them to forgive me.  I thought that there is nothing that I would be able to do if they do not want to pardon me, and I would accept the sentences meted on me and realise that I am reaping what I have sown.  I no longer want to do these things because I realised that they were bad.</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Did you write a poem there in that cell in Pretoria?</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Yes, I did write a poem when I was in the death row.  I was reminiscing about where I was coming from.  This poem brought some bitterness in me, although I did not put everything as it happened on me.  I made it to sound nice at certain places, about some of the things that were actually not true.  I was just trying to write a poem.</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Do you have that poem here today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Will you please read it out for us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Yes (poem read) Although I was trained, I just made it up in the poem that I was trained at Emandleni.</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> It is written in English, that is correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Poem title, who I am.  I am the IFP, I am the soldier who I am.  I am well trained.  I am the son of Goodwill (The King of the Zulus.)  Who I am, I am an incredible, you can't find me anywhere, but I am there for protection at iZingolweni.  They know me.  At Ulundi they saw me.  Everywhere they know me, who I am.  I am the one who was trained, trained at eMandleni at uMfolozi.(This place where I say I was trained at is not true. It is true that I was trained but not at this mentioned place).</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Please go ahead.</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> When I am back, I spoke the misunderstood language.  They said it is isigagaga, but I simply said ga-ga-ga.  The answer was the G3.  Who I am, I am the one who is fighting for my land.  I am the one who was jailed for the truth.  I am the one who was jailed for my friends.  I am the one who was jailed for the death of my loving mother.  I am the one who was tried to be killed every moment of my life.  I am the physician of human life, I am the scientist of human training, I am the biologist of human thoughts.  I am the fighter fighting for my eternal life.  Who I am.  Now you know who I am, for I am here for you my friends.  Yes, I am here for my life to surrender.  In death, pain I surrender.  If I die for my rights, who I am.</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a>	My soul will cry no more, for though hearts are free to be stopped, for my eyes are free to be closed, for my feet will walk no more, but if my present is for the struggle of letting my friends in the hands of Buthelezi, who I am.  Mothers, fathers, sons, daughters, brothers and sisters, I remember the spirit of  Gqozo, who said the blood will heal the broken soul.  Who I am.  Some call me uklova, for though that is true, I am the son of the free area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a>	I am the son of liberation.  (That is all).</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> A lot has happened in your life.  Are you sorry for what you have done with hindsight now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> I sometimes ask myself whether it truly me who killed people in this manner, and the truth comes back to me.  I do not know what I can do to convince those people I killed their children that I am really sorry for what I did.  I do not expect them to forgive me if their hearts do not say so, but I am really sorry.  In Zulu we say there is always a light at the end of the tunnel, and I see the light now because the violence has subsided, although I was touched at what happened in Shobashobane after I was arrested.  What made this incident to touch me is because many woman and old people were killed there.  People in Shobashobane know very well that I was not fighting them or their woman, I was fighting their children.  Nobody can say Shobashobane that I attacked them when I did not get their children.  I am very sorry for what I did to these people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a>	I would also like the Commission to give me a chance to say sorry to the Majesty the King of the Zulus, for killing his father's people in this manner.  I also say sorry to the President of my political party because this is not what he wanted me to do.  I was forced to do these things because of how I looked at things at that time, something that is far different from how I see things now.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a>	I also ask the president of the country, President Mandela, to pardon me for what I did to his country.  I have realised that these two prominent people are working together to build our country, and there is no need for us in the grass roots to fight each other on political reasons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a>	I therefore ask the people I killed their children to forgive me, and I would like to say to the surviving people who were present when my loving mother was killed that I forgive them because I think they do not know what they were doing.  I also blame some of the mothers in Izingolweni area that things became so bad in the area because of their doings.  They let their children to be involved in politics and kill people.  I do not blame all the mothers, no, but those who could not tell their children that what they were doing was bad, because they were afraid that their kids would kill them.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Mr Ngcobo, just a few last questions.  You received a list you said with Dan Cele's killing, where he told you he was involved in your mother's attack, the attack on your mother.  Does this, there is now a lot of charges of murder here, is Mr Dan Cele the only one that you killed regarding your mother's death?  What is the position, what happened to the other people on that list?</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> I could not get many of the people in the list, people like Steleka and Dan Cele.  I am not the only person who was looking for these people.  Some of them were killed by other people who were wronged by these boys.  However, I am the only one who caught and I was then blamed for all the people who were killed.  That is why I pleaded not guilty because I am not the one who killed them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> You also said in your poem and I think the Commission would like to know about it, that you were trained.  Can you briefly explain to the Commission where you were trained and what was the training?</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> I was trained in Amatikulu, but I was not trained to go and kill people, but to protect the chief.  That is why I did not use the firearm from the party when I killed these people.  I used the one that I was found with in my possession.</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Is there anything else that you want to add?</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> No, except to say that enough is enough.  Many people have been killed now and arms should be put down.  I once more say I am sorry for what I did.  I am more sorry for the mother of this Cele boy from Ulundi and I cannot set my eyes on his mother because I did not know why I killed his son.  It is only that he was amongst my enemies when I attacked them.  I would also like to address the Zulu family and say it was not my intention to kill their son.  I admit that I am a sinner and I really ask you to forgive me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Mr Chairman, that is the evidence of Mr Ngcobo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a><span class="speaker">NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR DE KLERK:</span> .</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Which of these applications that you have led evidence on, just give me the names of the counts on which you are seeking amnesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Count 1 Mr Chairman, that is for Dan Cele, count 2, Xolani Dlamini, the attempted murder for count 3, Thokozani Shazi, Jeffrey Sandile Ncane or Babazani Shezi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Those are all count 3?</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> That is correct, is seems that it is different names for the same person.  Count 4, the murder of Thembinkosi Wellington Mautinqobo.  Count 5, that was the murder of Muntuza Sgadlani Titiza Cele.  Count 6, count of murder, the death of Thomas Mfanafuti Blose.  Count 7, also a count of murder Goodwill Mxolisi Cele.</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a>	Count 8, also attempted murder, the names mentioned there was Maxwell Zulu and or Fana Milton Cele.  Count 9, murder, Khehla Maikashika Mkhize.  Not count 10, that was the attempted murder.  Also not count 11, also not count 12, neither count 13.</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a>	But well for 14, that is the murder of Doda Nxumalo, also known as Doda Nyawose.  Does not apply for amnesty on count 15.  Ask for amnesty on counts 16 and 17.  Does not apply for amnesty on count 18, neither 19, 20, 21, 22.  Also not for 23, 24 and 25.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr De Klerk, may I just ask can you tell us on appeal, which convictions were overturned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Mr Chairman, as far as I've got it and I must say that I did not see the appeal record itself, I did not have time to speak to Mr Lingenvelder, but as I can understand it, it was counts 23, 24, 25 that is the last three counts regarding the 22nd of October 1991 at Mdeni area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a>	Those three I know of, I don't know which is the fourth one my client is talking about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Would that be count 10?</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> I am under the impression, and it is my impression, that it must be count 10.  He was not convicted of 10 however.</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He was not convicted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> It wouldn't have been an appeal.  I am not sure of which was the fourth one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is there no way in which one can put this kind of dispute, this kind of difficulty out of the way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Yes, if time is given to me, I will find that out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr De Klerk, from the transcripts of the judgement on page 40 of the bundle, on count 10 indeed, he was found guilty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Then it is my mistake, then it was count 10.  Count 10 is the matter where Mr Ngcobo testified that Mbambo was actually the killer, or the attempted murderer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Brink, are there any questions you wish to put to this applicant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR BRINK:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Ngcobo, will you just tell us a bit more about this training you received in Matikulu, were there a group of you being trained, or was it you individually?</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> We were many, coming from different chiefs in KwaZulu-Natal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Were you taught the use of firearms, or had you already learnt that?</p>

<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Use of firearms to attack and defend?</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> No, we were trained to protect our chiefs as I said.  People in different areas were selected for training so that they could protect their respective chiefs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Were they members of the IFP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Try to avoid leading him on that?</p>

<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Would it have been about the time, or just before these various offences for which you are seeking amnesty, took place?</p>

<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Yes.  Dan admitted in my presence that he was there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Were any other persons known to you, involved in your mother's murder?</p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Yes, there were others like Steleka, Mshikashika and others.  Others were not killed by me.  Some of them are with me in prison, but they denied any knowledge of this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Was Xolani Dhlamini, that is count 2 Mr Chairman, involved to your knowledge in the murder of your mother?</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Was Thokozani Shazi or Jeffrey Ncane or Babazani Shezi, count 3 Mr Chairman, involved?</p>

<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Was Thembinkosi Wellington Ngcobo involved?</p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Thembinkosi was the person who stayed near where I was.  These people were many and I cannot some of the people who were in the list.  They were acting in groups.</p>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> I am giving you the names, and I want you to tell the Committee whether to your knowledge, the names I mention are persons involved in your mother's murder.  That is all I want at this stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a>	We know then that Mr Wellington Ngcobo was not suspected of having been involved in your mother's murder?</p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Thomas Blose?</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Yes, he was one of those who were involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> He was, all right.  Goodwill Mxolisi Cele?</p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> No, that one was not involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Maxwell Zulu, Fana Cele?</p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Kehla Mkhize, count 9 Mr Chairman? (Mshikashika)</p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Yes, he was very much involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Doda Nqxmalo, also known as Doda Nyawaose?</p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Yes, he was involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> So there were about four or five men who had been reported to you as being involved in your mother's murder?</p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Yes, they were many.  Some of them fled the area and came to Durban.  I cannot recall their names now.  I no longer have a list now and I do not know how I lost it.  Some are in prison with me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> When the police came to the scene of the crime, that is the crime relating to the murder of your mother, did you mention any of these names as people you might have thought who might have been involved, even though the names hadn't at that stage been given to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> No.  I did not... I did mention who the people were because they were known.  They used to toyi toyi and celebrate the whole night after the had killed a person, and everybody knew them and knew what they had done.  They were toyi toyiing even near the police station.</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Do you have a copy of your amnesty application available in front of you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Yes those were my words.  What I said here...</p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Let me just read to you what you said and if necessary my colleague can let you have his copy.  In paragraph 10(b) you were asked to provide your justification, thank you Mr (indistinct), you were asked to provide justification regarding the murders which you committed as being associated with a political objective.</p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a>	Is the manuscript that follows, your own or was it written for you?  </p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Yes, I am the one who wrote that.  Did I say the police wanted to kill them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What page are you talking about Mr Brink?</p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> It is bundle, page 2, Mr Chairman, paragraph 10(b).</p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Right, now you say all the cases, I presume you mean by all the cases, all the offences, murders and so on, which I have committed, were in relation to the ANC who had killed my mother as stated by the court witnesses, etc, etc.</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a>	The South African Police had refused to arrest the culprits involved in the killing of my mother, despite my having told them who the culprits were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a>	I had to take the law into my own hands, as I feared for my life and knew that the culprits who had killed my mother, wanted to kill me as well.  Do you remember writing that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Yes I said so.  I had told the police that my mother was killed by the comrades (ANC supporters), and the police wanted me to investigate this, whereas this was their job.</p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> The South African Police had refused to arrest the culprits involved in the killing of my mother, despite my having told them who the culprits were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> I cannot remember whether I mentioned their names.</p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Did you name them, did you name them to the Police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> I cannot remember whether I mentioned the names to them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Well you see, if you hadn't told the Police their names, the Police wouldn't have been able to take any steps towards an effective arrest.</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> I cannot remember whether I mentioned the names, as I say. Those police, however, are still stationed at iZingolweni. They are the ones who can say whether I mentioned certain names to them. It was just a coincidence that my mother was killed when violence was going on there. People would still have died even if my mother was not killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Would you have killed Dan Cele had your mother not been killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Yes.  I was going to kill them because he was an enemy, but it was not going to be in the manner I killed him.  I do not know how I was going to do that, but I was looking for him as much as he was looking for me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Killing is killing Mr Ngcobo, whichever way you do it.  You see, I get the impression from your application that this was really revenge killing, or a series of killings, because your mother was unfortunately murdered?</p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> That is not true.  It was not a revenge killing although my mother was killed.  War was going on at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In the trial court, as I understand the record, you told the Judge that you killed these people because they had killed your mother, that was the reason you gave.</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> The Commissioner must remember that I was defending myself in the trial case.  I was also helping my counsel so that I could be freed.  It is something else when you are facing a criminal trial.  One even tends to lie in a criminal case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now, how can you acquit yourself if you had told them that you had killed these people because they had killed your mother?</p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Will you please repeat that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How can you be defending yourself if you told the Judge that these crimes you committed, were committed because they killed your mother?</p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> That is how I perceived things at that time.  When IFP supporters were killed, nobody got arrested.  I then decided to kill too, because this looked liked a competition because nobody was getting arrested for doing this.  I was only surprised when I got arrested and wondered how it happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was nobody arrested or tried for killing your mother?</p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> I do not recall anybody getting arrested for killing my mother.  Not even one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In other words there was never a case for the murder of your mother, there was no case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> No.  Even the person who injured my sister was not arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is it correct that at your trial you did not give evidence about the fact that all the killing you have done, was as a result of your enmity for the ANC, that this was political killing, you did not tell this to the Court, is this correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Will you please repeat the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> At your trial you did not tell the Court that the crimes you committed, were for political reasons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> I remember saying that.  I cannot recall now but I think I did mention something about the organisation..</p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can you recall whether your client mentioned anything at all in his evidence in mitigation because the Judge ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Mr Chairman, I also only have the information that the Commission have.  I was not involved with that trial itself, but I do agree that he did not testify on his own behalf on mitigation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  He didn't say anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> I did read that in the judgement itself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, that is what I am trying to get at.</p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> I think Mr Chairman, if I may come in here, at page 53 of the bundle, the last line continue the next page, where the trial Judge said even if you were motivating these crimes by a political issue, etc, etc, talking about the ANC and the IFP, that is the bottom of page 53 over to page 54.</p>
<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> In the summary of the facts by the Attorney General, it was stated that it was a political case, so it seems that right through the trial, that it was known that politics had something to do with it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where is that passage in the judgement, on the question of sentence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> I cannot remember what the judge said.  I was absent minded when the judge talked to me.  I could not even remember the sentenced that I got.  I only remember the judge saying something about the death sentence and there were six death sentences, but I could not remember the years.</p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Carry on, I am sorry to disturb you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  You see, what you said in your application regarding the death of your mother, appears and I must put it to you again, appears to have been governed, or what you did, governed by revenge rather than politics, because the Police weren't taking any action and arresting those who might have been responsible for your mother's death.</p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> I deny that, but what was happening was something known by even a small child in the area.  My mother was killed in the midst of violence that was taking place at the time.  It also did not stop after her death.  I deny that I killed as a revenge for my mother, although that was contributory.</p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> You did indicate in your evidence in chief, that your mother was killed, I think you said 1990 or 1991.  Can we take it that in fact she was killed in 1991 because this killing spree appears to commence in February 1991 which would have been shortly, surely after her death?</p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> I cannot remember when my mother was killed.  My family is here, they are the ones who can say.  I cannot remember at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> One can assume that that would have been fairly close to the date when you committed the first murder and that is the murder of Dan Cele?  You wouldn't have waited for a year before you started killing people, or six months?</p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Yes.  That is possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Right.  Now, earlier you told the Committee that your mother's hut and the place where she was killed was near Nkulu ward.  How far is that from Oribi Gorge?  I am going through the counts one by one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line546"><a name="pos546"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> It is far although I cannot say how many kilometres.</p>
<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> How far?</p>
<p class="line" id="line548"><a name="pos548"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Fairly far.</p>
<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> And how far is Umthini bus stop from the place where your mother's hut was, before it was burnt down?</p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> It is not very far. Not as far as Oribi Gorge because it is a walking distance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Umtini bus stop, how far is that away?</p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> It is also far.  But it is a walking distance, unlike Oribi Gorge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Will it take you an hour to get there, or half an hour or a day or what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> About one and a half hour.</p>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> And Mtateni bus stop, how far is that away?  When I say away, I am talking about your mother's hut, in all the questions I am asking now, do you understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Mtateni is near uMthini. It is also far, but not that very far.</p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Dlovinga?</p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Dlovinga is nearby.</p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Bandlana?</p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Bandlana is far, but not very far.</p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> I am sorry, I withdraw that, he was acquitted on that count 15.  My mistake, I apologise.</p>
<p class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a>	You see on the face of the counts against you, it seems that you went on a spree of murders from February 1991 until July 1991, hadn't you had enough revenge by then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Er...</p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr Brink, did he not say that it wasn't revenge, and why do you pursue that line if he takes an opposite one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Mr Chairman, with respect I think he said it was partially revenge and also political.</p>
<p class="line" id="line566"><a name="pos566"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now you know, you have referred me to page 53 of the record.  Page 53 of the record conveys to me that it is his Counsel, he says the further factor urged by your Counsel is that there was political violence in the area, there had been killings and burnings by youth league and so on.  There may be some truth in it because it appears that from the evidence, that you specifically chose as your victims, only young men etc.</p>
<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a>	What I am trying to convey is that he did not give evidence to say that his offences were political, it was a submission made on his behalf by his Counsel.  The Court then goes on to say even if it were motivated by these crimes, by political issues, it is something which this Court cannot and will not condone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line568"><a name="pos568"></a>	The point really is that at no stage had he told the Court that he had committed these crimes for political reasons, it is his Counsel who advanced that point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Yes, that did appear from the record.  But in any event, I won't take that aspect any further.</p>
<p class="line" id="line570"><a name="pos570"></a>	(Indistinct), I am trying to deal with his application as it stood in paragraph 10(b), and that concludes my questioning, thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a><span class="speaker">NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR BRINK:</span> .</p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Just a few questions and really it is more for information than anything else.  On the court record it is stated that you went for training only for a period of two weeks.  Here evidence was given that it was a month.</p>
<p class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> I made a mistake.  It was two weeks.  It is my fault.</p>
<p class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And then, what I still find very difficult to</p>
<p class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a>understand, you tell us that you got the list from Dan Cele before you executed him at Oribi Gorge, gave you a list of names, and yet, you don't pursue those people immediately.  Can you explain that to us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> I was pursuing them.  I was looking for them, people like Steleka, and they were also looking for me.  It is just that our ways never met.  Unfortunately, some of them were killed before I got them and others fled to Durban.  I am now no longer involved in this and therefore no longer pursuing those who survived.</p>
<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> May I just for my own edification, summarise, you are saying to us that the people you killed within the framework of your explanation, were people who were comrades and who were killing people in your organisation within the community, that you had no instructions to kill, that you did that off your own bat, that you decided, you took the initiative, that you preached peace, but whilst the community did not know what you were doing, you were killing off the comrades, is that a fair summary?</p>
<p class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Yes.  I said so.  I did say in my evidence-in-chief that I once went to stay in Dlamini's and Luthuli's wards.  My party looked like a banned party at that time because they were afraid.  I then decided to start building the party.  When I went to Luthuli ward, I asked for assistance.  Luthuli's wife told me that they could help me in attacking people.  She said if I wanted to stay in their ward, I was free to do so, but when I go home, I should try to persuade people to rejoin the party.  When I went there, I persuaded people and fought those who fought me. That is why I was preaching peace on one hand and fighting on the another.  I wanted my party to grow, but did not want people to know the bad things I was doing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> What would you have understood at the time, to be the policy of the IFP, of the Inkatha Freedom Party?  Would they have supported it, would the President of your organisation in your understanding, have been proud of you or would he have been against what you were doing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> He would be against what I was doing.  That is why they never sent me to do these things.  I was doing this to protect myself and the community I was living in.  It was not from the party and that is why I was running away.  I had to protect the people in my area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you Chair, no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The organisation that you were building in your area, what was that called?</p>
<p class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Inkatha Freedom Party.</p>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And who were the officials in your area of the Inkatha Freedom Party that you were building?</p>
<p class="line" id="line585"><a name="pos585"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> It was Zulu, who was the chairman, and James Zulu was also a leader.  There were two Zulus, one a chairman that I cannot remember his first name, and James Zulu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line586"><a name="pos586"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What was James, James what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> James Zulu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line588"><a name="pos588"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You mentioned - yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line589"><a name="pos589"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> James Zulu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And did they know that you were trying to form this organisation by going around, killing other people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> No.  As leaders, I was hiding these things from them.  I did not have a group of killers.  I did this on my own, not with the people I was leading.</p>
<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, I am not talking about your followers, I am talking about the leaders, I am talking about the Chairman, Mr Zulu and I am talking about the other Zulu, did they tell you that in the name of the organisation, in order to build your organisation, you must kill the other people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line593"><a name="pos593"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> No.  They gave me the firearm to defend myself.  I just used that firearm to attack because I could not just wait to be attacked and defend myself then.  I would have been killed.  What I did was not the reason why I was given a firearm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line594"><a name="pos594"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Ngcobo, you said that you observed some of the ANC members through binoculars, do you remember saying so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line596"><a name="pos596"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How long before the first killing, were these binoculars taken away from you by the Police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line597"><a name="pos597"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> I cannot remember when the police confiscated the binoculars.  I used the binoculars to look for them and could not attack them when they were in groups.  I waited them to be alone so that I could attack them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line598"><a name="pos598"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You saw people being together, did you have absolute proof that because these people have gathered, that for instance Xolani Dlamini who you might have seen with these people, were you absolutely certain that he belonged to the other camp, that is the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line599"><a name="pos599"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Yes.  The message I got is that they were waiting for a bus from Gamalakhe to bring ANC supporters there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line600"><a name="pos600"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> This transportation you are speaking about, did for instance the IFP people have their own busses and the ANC people have their own busses?</p>
<p class="line" id="line601"><a name="pos601"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> At that place, ANC people use their buses because that was the ANC area.  There were no go areas then, as it is still happening at other places.</p>
<p class="line" id="line602"><a name="pos602"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Let's for a moment return to Mfanafuti Blose.  You say he was involved in the attacks of the community.  Was he attacking specific people in the community because you simply say he was involved in the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line603"><a name="pos603"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Mfanafuthi and his friend were attacking people.  For example they would arrest a male person who had assaulted his wife or girlfriend, and that person would be assaulted by a group of them, even girls, and they would then laugh at that person.  This was happening during the day, and they were raping girls as they wished.  The community knows that very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line604"><a name="pos604"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You have given us names of people who for instance killed your mother, would you associate him after you said he did all bad things to the community, even associate him with the killing of your mother?</p>
<p class="line" id="line605"><a name="pos605"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> You mean Mfanafuthi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line606"><a name="pos606"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That is correct sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line607"><a name="pos607"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> That is possible because people would leave, say Murchison and go to another area.  They would then meet people from that area and all of them would then go and do something to somebody at night, and they would then leave.  The same was done in another area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line608"><a name="pos608"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> For instance we could have some indication from you, because you said you observed some of these groups through your binoculars, did you ever observe him through your binoculars in the attack of your mother?</p>
<p class="line" id="line609"><a name="pos609"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> My binoculars were not those good, expensive binoculars.  One could see people who are not very far, and could see what they were doing.  However, one would not be able to say who are those people.  I could not go near them I was always a loner.</p>
<p class="line" id="line610"><a name="pos610"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You had testified that you had great respect for instance to the women folk, you wouldn't harm them at all.  Do you recall that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line611"><a name="pos611"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line612"><a name="pos612"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You went to the Hlope house, you first spoke to Mr Hlophe, thereafter to Mrs Hlophe.  Did you ever say to Mrs Hlophe, look, these boys in your house are troublesome, please speak to them, because you didn't want to hurt women.  Did you do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line613"><a name="pos613"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> No.  The harm I was talking about was the physical harm.  I know that I did harm to Hlophe's family, but I never hit a woman because that person is against me.  My crimes are an indication of that.  I cannot attack a woman because they are always defenceless.</p>
<p class="line" id="line614"><a name="pos614"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You say your biggest attempt was to mobilise people to join the Inkatha Freedom Party.  Could you explain to us, by killing people, how would you gather confidence from people that they would join your organisation, how would you achieve that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line615"><a name="pos615"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> The support of the IFP in the area was very small.  People were much afraid.  I was building the party because I built a lot of branches with Mr Zulu.  Another branch in my area was opened by Mr Khawula from eMahlongwa after I built it.  Not all ANC supporters were fighting us.  For example, there is an ANC leader in my area.  I used to chat to him when I was still outside and we never quarrelled.  I am imprisoned with other ANC members and we do not quarrel.  They know where we come from and that is something we cannot deny.  We now preach and we know what were doing before we were arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line616"><a name="pos616"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If we have regard Mr Ngcobo, to the people you killed, we realise the majority were youth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line617"><a name="pos617"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Yes.  They were the ringleaders.  Those were the people who were involved were these young boys, not the adults.</p>
<p class="line" id="line618"><a name="pos618"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Whilst you were mobilising the community after traumatising the mothers of these youths, do you think those people would have joined the IFP after being traumatised with death?</p>
<p class="line" id="line619"><a name="pos619"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Please repeat the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line620"><a name="pos620"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Let me rephrase it for you then Mr Ngcobo.  Your objective was to mobilise people to join Inkatha Freedom Party, isn't it so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line621"><a name="pos621"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line622"><a name="pos622"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And we see that the majority of the people you killed, were the youth isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line623"><a name="pos623"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line624"><a name="pos624"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If now you look at their mothers who are traumatised by their deaths, as you were by your mother, were you hoping that the mothers of these youths who had been killed, would join Inkatha Freedom Party?</p>
<p class="line" id="line625"><a name="pos625"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> No.  They would not.  Sometimes I was not thinking before I acted, and would make mistakes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line626"><a name="pos626"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You told us that the Police acted slowly or not at all, but then you tell us at the same time that you have been trained by the Zulu Police, do you recall saying so, KwaZulu Police or ZP, let me be specific, you called them ZP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line627"><a name="pos627"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> There was no KwaZulu Police at that time in Izingolweni.  They were only deployed in courts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line628"><a name="pos628"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> My question is why didn't you go to these Police whom you had such good relationship with, who could even train you to report these youths who were for instance, some of them who had killed your mother, why didn't you go to the Zulu Police, the ZP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line629"><a name="pos629"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> You mean at the training.</p>
<p class="line" id="line630"><a name="pos630"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you mention this to the Police who trained you, that I am coming here for training because I did not have joy from the South African Police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line631"><a name="pos631"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> No I never told the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line632"><a name="pos632"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Whilst you were at training that is, because we are not sure, and you are not, when you were trained, whether before the killings or after the killings, but you were trained at some stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line633"><a name="pos633"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> In the area I was not the only one who was chosen.  We were three and there were some who were trained before and after us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line634"><a name="pos634"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> On what basis were you chosen to be trained, what was the real reason therefore that you were chosen to be trained?</p>
<p class="line" id="line635"><a name="pos635"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> I was chosen in the area.  My brother Sipho was involved.  He is the one who took us there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line636"><a name="pos636"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry to disturb you, but who chose you for training?</p>
<p class="line" id="line637"><a name="pos637"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Amakhosi were being attacked by the ANC people.  The Commission will remember will remember that this is what was happening. People were chosen from different areas to go and train so that they could protect these amakhosi.  We believed that the ANC was against the amakhosi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line638"><a name="pos638"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You had according to you, to protect the amakhosi, protect them from what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line639"><a name="pos639"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> The Amakhosi were protected against the ANC. The Commissioner will remember that the amakhosi were attacked by the ANC supporters at that time, and it was decided that they should be protected. We believed that the ANC was against amakhosi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line640"><a name="pos640"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Which iNkosi had you to protect, because when we read the indictment for which you are serving in prison, is that there was none protection for any iNkosi but some personal revenge about your mother's killing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line641"><a name="pos641"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> My iNkosi was Khandalesizwe at that time and he was with me when I went to fetch my firearm at Ulundi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line642"><a name="pos642"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Could you just repeat that name please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line643"><a name="pos643"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The name of that INkosi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line644"><a name="pos644"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Khandalesizwe.  His other name is Sikhosiphi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line645"><a name="pos645"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thanda?</p>
<p class="line" id="line646"><a name="pos646"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Khandalesizwe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line647"><a name="pos647"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> When I listen to your evidence Mr Ngcobo you mention that the leaders Zulu for instance gave you a gun. My Question is when I further listened you used a .32 and again you used a 7.65 where did you obtain the other, I am not interested which one? Where did you obtain the other? Because they gave you one for self-protection.</p>
<p class="line" id="line648"><a name="pos648"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> This other one belonged to Mbambo.  It was found in his possession when the police arrested him in Sydenham.  That was a .32.  Both used the same ammunition.  A.32 is a revolver and a 7.65 has a cartridge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line649"><a name="pos649"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> So when you went to Ulundi to fetch weapons what did you do with those weapons when you accompanied Khandaleziswe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line650"><a name="pos650"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> I was protecting the chief with these firearms.  I was protecting him on his visits to the tribal court or when he visited the President.  I was also using them for my own political ends.</p>
<p class="line" id="line651"><a name="pos651"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> In other words the weapons you fetched from Ulundi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line652"><a name="pos652"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Yes.  I was using my firearm and the one belonging to my friend.  I never used the one I got from Ulundi because there was no need for me to use it because it was a legal firearm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line653"><a name="pos653"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Lastly Mr Ngcobo you told us that the hierarchy of Inkatha Free Party preached peace. You recall saying so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line654"><a name="pos654"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> Please repeat the question?  Yes they preached peace.  That is not what I was doing, however.  I used to attack and also protect myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line655"><a name="pos655"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> From your evidence it would appear that you did more attacks than protection? Would I be right in so gaining that impression?</p>
<p class="line" id="line656"><a name="pos656"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> I was also being attacked.  It is just that these people could not get hold of me.  Before I was sentenced, they used to attack me extensively, in the shop and all over.  Some of my attackers are in prison with me.  After I had killed, they attacked me while I was no longer attacking.  I was now a target.</p>
<p class="line" id="line657"><a name="pos657"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You were never shot by anybody?</p>
<p class="line" id="line658"><a name="pos658"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> No. They were trying their best with bombs and everything, but could not get hold of me. They also attacked me at Murchison but failed to hurt me. I reported some of the attacks to the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line659"><a name="pos659"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> But in all those attacks on you, you never killed anybody other than those you hunted down?</p>
<p class="line" id="line660"><a name="pos660"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> When they attacked me at the shop, they killed a Cele boy. It was Ziphakamiso Nyawose and Thokozani Mbhele, and some of their friends. They killed Guduza Mbhele. I retaliated when I was in the shop, and struck Thokozani Mbhele. He died on the scene and I went to fetch the police. Detective Breedt is the one who attended this complaint and those boys were then arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line661"><a name="pos661"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Did you report these attacks on people, that is the killing rather to your leaders?</p>
<p class="line" id="line662"><a name="pos662"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> No it was difficult to report to them to my leaders because they were against their policy.  I knew that they would not have liked it.  I believed that what I was doing was right.  It is not easy to report tot he leaders such things.  They were not the ones who were being attacked.  I am the one who was supposed to defend myself..</p>
<p class="line" id="line663"><a name="pos663"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> That is correct Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line664"><a name="pos664"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Thank you Chairperson I have got no further questions. Thank you Mr Ngcobo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line665"><a name="pos665"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Sorry Judge just one question following from Mr Motata's questioning. The firearms that the KwaZulu government or police issued you, that was after the killings? After your crimes. You again got weapons from the KwaZulu government or the KwaZulu police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line666"><a name="pos666"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> I went to training when violence was still going on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line667"><a name="pos667"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Also just for the record of your attorney on page 54 of the bundle the judge observes as what to him is disturbing in the extreme is that only 3 months before you stood trial you went for training for 2 weeks and you were issued with two firearms even licensed by the KwaZulu government from your Inkatha organisation he says. What happened to those arms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line668"><a name="pos668"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> The ones I got from Ulundi? I had them when I was arrested in Scottburgh. After I was arrested, I gave them to my brother Sipho, to take them back to Ulundi because they were licensed. I do not know whether he took them back or not. I never asked him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line669"><a name="pos669"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> If I read the portion of the judgment correctly it seems as if you got your training after you have already committed most of the crimes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line670"><a name="pos670"></a><span class="speaker">MR NGCOBO:</span> I cannot dispute that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line671"><a name="pos671"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are there any questions you wish to put in re-examination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line672"><a name="pos672"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> No questions Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line673"><a name="pos673"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes thank you very much. You are excused. WITNESS IS EXCUSED.</p>
<p class="line" id="line674"><a name="pos674"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you calling any other witnesses?</p>
<p class="line" id="line675"><a name="pos675"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> No further witnesses Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line676"><a name="pos676"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Brink are you calling witnesses?</p>
<p class="line" id="line677"><a name="pos677"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> No Chairman I am not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line678"><a name="pos678"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr de Klerk is there anything you wish to say in addressing us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line679"><a name="pos679"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman I will be brief. Firstly I would request the Commission to remember the time period and span when this took place what was the political reality or maybe just call it reality specifically in KwaZulu Natal and specifically in the south coast of KwaZulu Natal. If that is taken into consideration and the background of the applicant where he grew up and the way he grew up it may be more easily understood why he got involved with what he did and why he actually did. Unfortunately, it is my submission that although we do not likely want to admit it that political intolerance and specifically in this province and even today political intolerance is very hard. People perceive the opposition as their enemies not merely as the opposition. I think I can argue without any worry that there was attacks from both sides.</p>
<p class="line" id="line680"><a name="pos680"></a>	The applicant did what he thought would assist his position and his party's position in that area. Surely as he also testified it can be argued that there were revenge embedded in his thoughts. It is impossible to deny that. But just on the other side it is impossible to say in my submission that this was merely revenge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line681"><a name="pos681"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well now is there no possibility of drawing a line as to which of these killings were due to revenge and which not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line682"><a name="pos682"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> As was testified by the applicant Mr Chair his thoughts was influenced like anybody others thoughts by different things that happened in his life. One of it was the fact that his mother died. The other was that he was (...intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line683"><a name="pos683"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That seems to be the uppermost factor when one reads the record of the trial, of the judgment isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line684"><a name="pos684"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Well in the criminal trial as was testified by the applicant he lied. Secondly he did not testify regarding any of the political matters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line685"><a name="pos685"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So there are two lies, two things that were wrong. First he lied on the question of whether he was doing it for revenge. Secondly he did not testify anything about the political motives he had.</p>
<p class="line" id="line686"><a name="pos686"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> His counsel did argue that so if he is (...intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line687"><a name="pos687"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No I am not talking about his counsel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line688"><a name="pos688"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> So if his counsel argued it, it must have been on instructions. I cannot believe that the counsel will argue it out of his own without receiving instructions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line689"><a name="pos689"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(inaudible) but there was no evidence. He did not give evidence on that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line690"><a name="pos690"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> The fact that I will argue that the reason or the fact that there was no evidence led at the criminal trial does not say per se that the reason why it actually happened as testified today is (...indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line691"><a name="pos691"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No but there was not a breath during the trial as far as the evidence is concerned, there was not a breath of his political motives as far as the evidence is concerned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line692"><a name="pos692"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> The evidence by the accused today, the applicant was denied. So it was a denial of involvement. If it was a denial of involvement there would not have followed any admissions of a political motive.</p>
<p class="line" id="line693"><a name="pos693"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And even after conviction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line694"><a name="pos694"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Even after conviction because you must remember that there followed as appeal. And it is common that even after conviction ninety percent of all convicted persons does not come clean to the Court and then say: "Okay this is the position, I actually did it because of this and this." That is the great thing about the Amnesty and the Truth and Reconciliation process. Now they do have the chance to come forward and say that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line695"><a name="pos695"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line696"><a name="pos696"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Thank you Mr Chair. I must just point to one specific aspect and that is the poem that Mr Ngcobo the applicant wrote while he was on death row and I think it cannot be denied he even almost cried where he sat when he read that poem. But it is clear from that poem that he had a political motive. That politics as he perceived it and many other people in this province perceived it made him do certain things which he thought was right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line697"><a name="pos697"></a>	I believe firstly and I will argue that he told the truth to the Commission. Although politics was not the only reason for what was has happened as anybody else there is not one specific reason that make somebody act in a certain way, politics was the main reason. Although it was not said at the criminal trial. He told everything, he disclosed everything to this Commission. It must have been extremely difficult for him to come and say and admit what he has done. He has told the Commission on which of these crimes he was not there even if he was convicted. And he said that he was sorry. 	</p>
<p class="line" id="line698"><a name="pos698"></a>	To finalise it Mr Chairman this province especially during that time had a lot of these violence. A lot of these people did not come to the Truth Commission because they have certain worries about the Truth Commission. If persons that were involved in this war as testified by the applicant and surely it was a war. It could not have been anything else. If it is compared to any other incident in the world it must have been a war. </p>
<p class="line" id="line699"><a name="pos699"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> All you have is his version as given today about that, isn't it so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line700"><a name="pos700"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> That's right it was never disputed that it was a war. So the fact of the matter is I will argue that it was a war. Many people died. It was never disputed. It was a lot of people that died in this province. It is a known fact throughout the world. If these people did not have a political motive and merely participated in this war for some or other private and personal reasons it means that for these people that suffered on grassroots level it would have been unnecessary to apply for amnesty. Because what political motive did they have. All of them and most of them must have been in the same position. Either telling the world that they are protecting themselves and that is why they attacked or revenge. But all of this seen in the nature that they were politically motivated and politically divided. This is the basic, the lowest part of political intolerance in this country. And if these people can not receive amnesty then none and nobody of the people that were involved in this war can receive amnesty. That is all thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line701"><a name="pos701"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What do you have to say about the criteria that are set out in subsection 3 of Section 20? Have you got the Act with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line702"><a name="pos702"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> No I don't have it with me. If you can just jog my mind?</p>
<p class="line" id="line703"><a name="pos703"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Don't you have a copy of the Act in front of you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line704"><a name="pos704"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Not with me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line705"><a name="pos705"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Brink do you have a copy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line706"><a name="pos706"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> I think so ...(inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line707"><a name="pos707"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Which Section Mr Chairman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line708"><a name="pos708"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well the criteria that are set out in Section 20 subsection 3. Because in order to determine whether the offences he has committed were acts associated with a political objective and in order to determine whether they were the criteria are set out in subsection 3.</p>
<p class="line" id="line709"><a name="pos709"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Yes my argument on that maybe it was not that clear. I do not understand Section 3 as requiring the applicant to put forward some or other intricate and involved political ideology and motive. We are talking here about an applicant that put to the Committee his motive as the basic motive of overpowering the other side. That means if you do take out people that gives you problems you make it more easy for yourself. And I think that was clear in his evidence. These people were people that he received information that either wanted to kill him or wanted to do something against his party and he acted on that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line710"><a name="pos710"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just let's understand this. The picture one gets up to now is that this is a one-man activity that has brought him here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line711"><a name="pos711"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line712"><a name="pos712"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes. He has not been instructed by his superiors. He has never reported to them. He has never got their sanction for doing. It was he and himself that carried out these activities which have resulted in the offences for which he was convicted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line713"><a name="pos713"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Yes. Regarding that specific matter there was a matter of Judge Wilson specifically where an ANC person applied for amnesty he was busy at a meeting and he received the information that this person he received information about was killing ANC people. He then took it upon himself to stop this unnecessary killing and he then went and killed that person. he received amnesty. I do not see from this specific.</p>
<p class="line" id="line714"><a name="pos714"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you know what case you are talking about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line715"><a name="pos715"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> I don't, if I can stand down I can quickly get it from my office because I received from the internet. I do have the reference but not with me at the moment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line716"><a name="pos716"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line717"><a name="pos717"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> I would give it to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line718"><a name="pos718"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Let us have it early in the morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line719"><a name="pos719"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Early in the morning. I don't see the subsection 3 as saying there must have been an order.</p>
<p class="line" id="line720"><a name="pos720"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No it does not say it has to be. These are just all the criteria that are set out and I want to know from you  what your views are in so far as your client's case is concerned whether he meets these criteria?</p>
<p class="line" id="line721"><a name="pos721"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Definitely I think that he had a motive which was political. You see in the context of what is done it shows there were political uprising disturbance and it was a reaction thereto.</p>
<p class="line" id="line722"><a name="pos722"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What uprising was he reacting to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line723"><a name="pos723"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Well there was killing. There was a war at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line724"><a name="pos724"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, no he personally? I am not talking about what was happening in other parts of eZingolweni. I am talking about him personally?</p>
<p class="line" id="line725"><a name="pos725"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Him personally being in that area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line726"><a name="pos726"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line727"><a name="pos727"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Him personally being involved in that killing. Him personally being involved as a leader, a youth leader.</p>
<p class="line" id="line728"><a name="pos728"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You had the situation where he walks into a house with a gun and he can arrest a young man who he thinks had a say in an attack and instead of taking him to the police he executes him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line729"><a name="pos729"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> I think Mr Chairman the reality of that time was that people did not go to the police. There was attacks from both sides. It was clear that it was a war. So it was not uncommon for people not to go to the police. It was actually quite common for people to mistrust the police at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line730"><a name="pos730"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well now what about subsection F of Section 3 then? Where they talk about the proportionality of the offence in relation to the objective which he hopes to achieve.</p>
<p class="line" id="line731"><a name="pos731"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Well I think the objective to achieve and that means for the one political party to win against the other one I don't think you can get a higher political objective seeing into the context of what happened at that stage. If you can eliminate your enemy which is your political opponent and by that secure that your party is actually the winning party, there is no bigger prize that you can strive for.</p>
<p class="line" id="line732"><a name="pos732"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is there no such thing at all as want to take into account the proportionality of his offence in relation to the objective which he is seeking to achieve?</p>
<p class="line" id="line733"><a name="pos733"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> I agree with that as I put it Mr Chairman I must argue that his objective was the highest objective and that is to secure his party's success. As it would have been for a freedom fighter for the ANC to blow up 10, 20 people in a restaurant trying to secure democracy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line734"><a name="pos734"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well there would be difficulty in arguing by analogy in cases that are so disparate. The circumstances there, the factors there are completely different from a chap who armed with a gun and who stalks his enemy, he watches them, he knows where they live and one by one literally goes to where they were and eliminates them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line735"><a name="pos735"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Mr Chairman taking into consideration now the context. The fact that he was the youth leader. The fact that he also personally suffered. That his mother was killed. The fact that he was also attacked and that other members of his party was being attacked at that stage. Surely there must be a (...indistinct) It is not just one person that's mother was injured, nothing else, he is nobody and he decides upon himself to now to go and kill a lot of people. The context is much bigger than that. The context his a youth leader, a IFP youth leader that believes in what he is doing. Now further things happen that then make him come to this conclusion. Surely it couldn't have been just an easy procedure, it must have been a lot of influences that made him come to this conclusion or to this decision.</p>
<p class="line" id="line736"><a name="pos736"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes carry on? So you say that he meets the requirements of Subsection F of Section 3?</p>
<p class="line" id="line737"><a name="pos737"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Definitely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line738"><a name="pos738"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line739"><a name="pos739"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr de Klerk could I take you back to Subsection 2 and specifically Subsection 2(A) which refers to an act with a political objective being</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line740"><a name="pos740"></a>"1: committed in this instance by a member of a political organisation in support of such organisation."</blockquote>

<p class="line" id="line743"><a name="pos743"></a>	Now on the evidence was the applicant not telling us that he did not do this bona fide on the agenda of the organisation.

In terms of us having to apply criteria. And let us for the sake of that assume for the moment everything else that you have put before us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line744"><a name="pos744"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> As pleases Mr Chairman. I read Subsection 2(A)</p>

<p class="line" id="line752"><a name="pos752"></a>liberation movement."</p>
<p class="line" id="line753"><a name="pos753"></a>There was a war according to the accused between the ANC and the IFP. He bona fide believed that he was doing this in furtherance of his political struggle and the struggle of the IFP. Although it was not sanctioned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line754"><a name="pos754"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He couldn't have believed that the IFP were going to agree with what he was doing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line755"><a name="pos755"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> No he did not believe that. But he bona fide believed that by doing this he is furthering his party's success in the coming elections.</p>
<p class="line" id="line756"><a name="pos756"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How could he have believed that when he knew that it was his party's policy not to engage in violence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line757"><a name="pos757"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> I can only argue that Mr Chairman that, that is where the multi-facets of the decision-making comes in with the fact that his mother was also killed. So yes there is situations where he did do something that was not specifically according to the orders and the policy of the party. But he bona fide believed by doing this he is actually doing something good for the party.</p>
<p class="line" id="line758"><a name="pos758"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you say he bona fide believed don't, let's just leave out. You mean he believed not necessarily bona fide. I mean if he knew (...intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line759"><a name="pos759"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Yes he believed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line760"><a name="pos760"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If he knew what the political party's policy was and organisation and that it was against violence in principle, he knew that. He is a highly placed member of the, he claims to be a leader of the Inkatha youth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line761"><a name="pos761"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> I think in his evidence it was clear that it was never said that he is not allowed to defend and he also testified that he received information that these people would either attack him or did attack. And he also testified that this was a measure of defence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line762"><a name="pos762"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> None of these people that he has killed died in defending him or attacking him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line763"><a name="pos763"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Yes but.</p>
<p class="line" id="line764"><a name="pos764"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> They were all picked up, stalked as it were and eliminated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line765"><a name="pos765"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> It was testified that, on several occasions by the applicants that if he received the information that this person is the person that attacked or will attack he would have acted because it was a sort of a pre-emptive way to try and stop what was happening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line766"><a name="pos766"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr de Klerk I am prepared for the sake of this argument to accept that amnesty is there not for cases of self-defence. So we are not talking about self-defence in the situation of being attacked. So let's accept that for the moment but the question then remains what are we to make of the concepts "bona fide" in Subsection 2(A) of 20 and "order and approval" in Subsection 3(E)? Are we to disregard those concepts? Or - and this is really my question. Is it not compelling us to say that a person must have in good faith believed that he was on the agenda of the organisation and not simply in support of the organisation. Or to the benefit of the organisation by his own assessment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line767"><a name="pos767"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> I understand that Mr Chairman. I do believe that what will bona fide mean? Is it an objective or a subjective test? Are we now going to say what did he believe himself? I believe it is a subjective test.</p>
<p class="line" id="line768"><a name="pos768"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I will grant that but what was his evidence on that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line769"><a name="pos769"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> His evidence was clear that although he was never allowed or it was not the aim of the political party to attack all these attacks that took place and he was involved with he received information either that this person was the guilty one in some or other murder or is going to attack him or is planning or he is going to do something. And he bona fide believed in his mind that this will benefit the party. And I am sure, I don't want to be difficult but I am sure that it can be seen as self-protection which was condoned by the party. The self-protection side. That means we are not there just to sit and be attacked and accept it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line770"><a name="pos770"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We must not confuse two issues as to self-protection on the one hand. When a man does that because he believes that somebody is going to kill him. He takes the initiative and goes and kills them. That is what might fall under the heading of self-protection. But then that cannot be equated with the political motive of his political party. He did not do it for that reason. He did it because he was told that they were after him and therefore before they could get him he would go and get them. That was the driving force behind what he did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line771"><a name="pos771"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Yes if he was a normal person I would prepare to agree with you but he was the youth leader, the IFP youth leader.</p>
<p class="line" id="line772"><a name="pos772"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Does that make him abnormal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line773"><a name="pos773"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> No it puts him in a position as a political leader. So by defending him he is defending the party. It is not mere self-defence. By protecting yourself as political leader you are in effect protecting the party. It is not mere self-defence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line774"><a name="pos774"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So he is equating himself as the party?</p>
<p class="line" id="line775"><a name="pos775"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Oh definitely. The fact remains that he thought bona fide that this what he is doing is to the benefit of the party. And the party did not ever said there is anything wrong with protecting yourself. And it does not seem that any of these persons were merely killed without any reason. That means by aggression alone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line776"><a name="pos776"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well he went around killing innocent people and he is now sorry for having tried to kill them or shoot them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line777"><a name="pos777"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> No</p>
<p class="line" id="line778"><a name="pos778"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He shot people whom he didn't even know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line779"><a name="pos779"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> But he had information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line780"><a name="pos780"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes he may have information, he may have misinformation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line781"><a name="pos781"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> That is possible Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line782"><a name="pos782"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes. So what happens to the mothers and the fathers of those people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line783"><a name="pos783"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> The fact remains that if he acted on that information and he bona fide believed that, that information was correct he did that for the purpose to protect himself as leader and for the party.</p>
<p class="line" id="line784"><a name="pos784"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes alright.</p>
<p class="line" id="line785"><a name="pos785"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Mr de Klerk let's probably stretch our imagination and say 23, stretch it. Give it liberal construction. And then we return and say he was given a gun by Zulu for instance that he should protect himself with that gun that he was now looking at the subject element of bona fide - that he was even shy to go back to Zulu and say: "I have killed people with that gun." Would we say even if we give it that liberal construction we would be falling in the ambit of the Act?</p>
<p class="line" id="line786"><a name="pos786"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Yes I believe so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line787"><a name="pos787"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Despite not even - say condonation after the fact of his actions. Even let's say no orders condonation after the fact?</p>
<p class="line" id="line788"><a name="pos788"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> I must say I found one thing difficult. Maybe the Commission can assist me there. I don't know what was the position with all the applications up till now. Did each and every individual in those matters receive a order or some or other instruction? Or was it condoned afterwards? I don't know. I am of the opinion that if this person subjectively bona fide believed what he is doing is to the benefit of the party -even if he hides it from the party, what difference does that makes in his mind?</p>
<p class="line" id="line789"><a name="pos789"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well it all revolves around the use of your word "bona fide."</p>
<p class="line" id="line790"><a name="pos790"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> That is correct yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line791"><a name="pos791"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The question is that was he bona fide when he knows that it is in the policy of his party. When he knows that the Inkatha Freedom Party is not in favour of the resort to violence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line792"><a name="pos792"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Except in the circumstances where it also comes down to protection. I am not going to use the word self-protection. I am going to use the word protection.</p>
<p class="line" id="line793"><a name="pos793"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes so we are now talking about this bona fide?</p>
<p class="line" id="line794"><a name="pos794"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Because Mr Chairman I am sure that in the past what we have listened today is not an uncommon situation. What about the normal citizen that were attacked by the opposition group. He retaliates the next morning. He goes and kill those people. He actually ran after them and killed two or three more. That is what happened. Many thousands of those incidents took place. Does none of them fall under this Act? Was this Act not also for the benefit of these people which on the lowest level were involved in this conflict.</p>
<p class="line" id="line795"><a name="pos795"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr de Klerk that's exactly the question we are asking you. We have to make that deduction on the basis of the wording of the Act. And we asking you to assist us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line796"><a name="pos796"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> I believe yes. I believe yes. The reason why I say this. It is not a simplistic situation where you know it is only self-defence or revenge. It is a Zulu, traditional Zulu man, only standard 6 being chosen to be the political leader maybe without the knowledge or the necessary knowledge of how to be a political leader. Being sent for training by his brother. Being caught up by a total unnatural and uncommon situation of war. This is a situation where we have to look at the person. Now he acts on those impulses. He believes what he is doing is to the benefit of the party. Surely it is also to the benefit of him. He is not going to be killed if he kills the people that wants to kill him. Surely he is not telling it to the party. But he believes in his heart and it shows from his poem that he did it as a soldier. As a warrior to the benefit of everybody. Not even the party but everybody in his community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line797"><a name="pos797"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Except of course the victims.</p>
<p class="line" id="line798"><a name="pos798"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Except the victims if we consider that they were not involved in any actions against the other group at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line799"><a name="pos799"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Well even if we do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line800"><a name="pos800"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes. Is there anything else you wish to add? Mr Brink is there anything you wish to say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line801"><a name="pos801"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Mr Chairman nothing substantial. A lot of the difficulties have already been put by members of the Committee here. But I think my learned friend has argued as best he could in this matter at the same time and that should possibly assist him. If one has reference to the decision of a Committee of which you Mr Chairman was chairman in the matter of BOTHA, SMUTS AND MARAIS and you will remember that of those three I think Botha was refused amnesty on the basis that he had not been given any orders to do what he had done. Mr Chairman you will remember that very briefly the facts in that case were that on a certain morning and close to the beach area in Durban there was an attack upon various members of the public, the majority of whom I believe to have been white-skinned by youths who were said to have been wearing PAC shirts. BOTHA, SMUTS AND MARAIS who were according to them members of what I think was called the Order Boerevolk decided that they would exact revenge and they then went looking for trouble, no more no less. And they shot at a bus carrying completely innocent people who may or may not have been PAC members, may or may not have been ANC members or whatever. As a result of which there were a number of deaths and serious injuries. My recollection is that Smuts and Marais received amnesty. And the problem I have is in regard to consistency. Bearing in mind the provisions of the Act which you and Mr Malan have referred. Those are the only comments I ...(inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line802"><a name="pos802"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In that case you will recall that the two who got amnesty were acted on the orders and instructions of the (...indistinct) Do you understand?</p>
<p class="line" id="line803"><a name="pos803"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line804"><a name="pos804"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That was the distinction between him and the other chaps who did get amnesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line805"><a name="pos805"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> That is very true but you know the orders and instructions, with respect were limited in the sense that this was a three man band of which Botha claimed to be the head.</p>
<p class="line" id="line806"><a name="pos806"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well not Botha claimed. It was Botha who, it was undisputed Botha ordered these people to bring their arms because we are going somewhere. We are going to do something. And they gather their arms and they follow him and he then tells them that this is what I am going to do. And I think that because they acted on the orders and instructions of somebody that was a determining factor.</p>

So I also have my own trials in the normal courts that I had to postpone and that I quickly had to go there and postpone the matters because of the.</p>
<p class="line" id="line810"><a name="pos810"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So there is nothing you wish to add in writing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line811"><a name="pos811"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> No the one statement I can make is that in the indictment it was clear also from the Attorney General that this was politically motivated matter. It was specifically stated in the (...intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line812"><a name="pos812"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In the indictment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line813"><a name="pos813"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE KLERK:</span> Yes summary of facts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line814"><a name="pos814"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well the Committee will reserve its decision and give it in due course. Thank you very much. The Committee adjourns and we will resume punctually tomorrow morning Mr Brink at nine thirty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line815"><a name="pos815"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> I think it is a gentleman from the prisons who is here.</p>

<p class="line" id="line822"><a name="pos822"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes you may not know this but today we lost very valuable time when people whose case was not on were brought here in time and this man whose case was on was not brought for until an hour and a half. Now I have difficulty in understanding how the man whose case was supposed to be head first was not brought and the others brought.</p>
<p class="line" id="line823"><a name="pos823"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDLOVO:</span> ...(inaudible)</p>
