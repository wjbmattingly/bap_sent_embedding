I have been in communication with his attorney and I've told him that it is desirable that his client's application be heard by the Panel as it is presently constituted, because a great deal of the evidence relevant to the background in this matter has already been placed before us.  The members of the family of the deceased were present throughout the hearing.  One wants to avoid causing them inconvenience and the upshot of it is, I have now arranged for him, that's Mr Britz, to give him a special dispensation by interposing his application at half past nine on Wednesday morning.  He is going to come down with his client and we will then be able to close this chapter of the hearing.  So, we must work between now and then on the basis that on Wednesday morning we might have to suspend whatever we are doing to enable us to finish another matter.
