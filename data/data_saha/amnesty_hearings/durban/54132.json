The Panel is constituded as has been indicated on the record earlier.  We have on the roll this morning the amnesty application of S P Khumalo, amnesty reference AM1584/96.

If I am going to testify here today and say everything that happened, whereas they are complaining that they are not in a position to testify because their forms are missing.  I do not want to betray people by testifying here under these circumstances.  For us to stay in jail, I know eventually that some of the people who were harassed and ourselves will benefit, because if we are granted amnesty the people who were victims, it's very important, because we also get bad dreams when we think about the fact that all we did was a mistake, but we are grateful to get a chance to ask for an apology.

So it's something that seems to have been coming on, so I think we will have to deal with it as part of the preparations for the resumed hearing.\n\tWell we have listened to what the legal representatives and the applicant had said, it appears as if through some logistical problem - and this is not really uncommon, there has been some misunderstanding about the legal representation for the applicant in this matter.  The Committee has engaged the services of Mr Webster, who has been prepared to deal with the matter on fairly short notice.  And that, I must add, is the kind of co-operation that we normally get from the attorneys and the other legal representatives in dealing with the matters that we have to deal with, and without that kind of co-operation we really wouldn't be able to be doing this work.  \n\tWe have a great deal of work to do, there are still a number of remaining applications to be dealt with and everybody, in their own way, contributes to us being able to do that.  But it appears as if the applicant has engaged the services of a legal representative of his choice and as much as postponements and delays in finalising matters cause difficulties for us and for the process, it is one of the fundamental principles that we have to take into consideration in ensuring that the proceedings are fair, that the applicant, like the other interested parties, are satisfied with the arrangements in regard to their legal representation.\n\tSo under those circumstance, we unfortunately will not be able to proceed with this particular matter today, we will have to postpone the matter.  We are unable to allocate a date on which the matter would be heard again.  That is normally arranged administratively by our office in Cape Town, in conjunction with the legal representatives, which will happen again in this particular case.  And the matter will, as I have tried to indicate earlier in discussing it with the applicant, it will have to slot in where there is a place and a space available to hear it next, which by the nature of the things will probably be in a matter of months. \tSo under those circumstances we would adjourn the matter for a date to be arranged, when it will be heard.  We must apologise for the normal inconvenience that goes with this sort of situation, but we try to ensure that the matters are dealt with as fairly as possible, and we think it's fair under these circumstances, to postpone and to give an opportunity for the legal representative who has been engaged by the applicant himself, to be availble to deal with the matter.   So under those circumstance, the matter is postponed.  \n\tMr Webster, we would excuse you, we thank you for your assistance and your willingness to come into the matter, but for now you'd be excused then.",

The document that I'm referring to, Chairperson, is the document numbered 1 to 8, I think - it is 1 to 7, being the translation of the signed document 8 to 17, and I believe in the interest of justice I should just place this on record, so that when the matter is heard next time these problems will have been sorted out, because there are inaccuracies in the translations.  \nThe ones I've picked up, for the record, appear on page 2 of the translation and page 10 of the original Zulu version, paragraph 9(a)(iv).\n\t-\tThe next one appears on page 3 of the translation and it is on page 12 of the Zulu application, paragraph 10(a).  \n\t-\tThe next one appears on page 4 of the translated document, and paragraph 13 of the Zulu application, of the Zulu form, paragraph 10(b).  \n\t-\tThe next one is also on - or perhaps before I go there, just in order to clarify.  On page 4, 10(b), it's the one re: Vusi Maduna(?).  \n\t-\tThe next one which also appears on page 4 of the interpreted document and page 14 of the Zulu form, is towards the bottom of the page, dealing with Moses ...(indistinct) Dlamini.  \n\t-\tThe next one is on page 5 of the interpreted form, page 14 of the original application form, re: paragraph 10(d).  \n\t-\tThe next appears at page 6 of the intrepreted form and page 16 of the original form, re: paragraph 13(a).\n\tThese are very material and need to be attended to when the matter comes up, as the interpretations as they stand can lead to a miscarriage of justice, particularly if the persons who are dealing with the matter do not understand or cannot read Zulu.
