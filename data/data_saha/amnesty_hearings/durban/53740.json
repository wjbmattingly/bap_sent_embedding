It's got a band playing in there and quite often, well most occasions the group normally has a non-European in the band.  So we do get quite a few of the non-European coming in to listen to the group and things like that, but I would say that it's not a popular non-European bar.\"\nThe question then is -\n\"What's non-European?  I don't understand non-European, what's non-European?\"\nHe says -\n\"Well, I mean Asiatics and Indians, that type of thing.\"\nThe question is -\n\"What's the difference between an Asiatic and an Indian?\"\nOn the next page, 802, the question continues -\n\"I don't know.  Is Asiatic classified as Indian?\"\nOh sorry, that's the answer -\n\"I don't know.  Is Asiatic classified as Indian?\"\n\t\t\"Well, Coloured, Indians and Africans. Does that make it more clear?\"\n\t\t\"Alright, carry on\"\nThen he answers -\n\"Well it's not popular with that crowd, I mean they don't come in that often, but they do come in as musicians and listen to the band and that type of thing, but it is predominant white.\"\nThe question then is -\n\"That's Magoo's you are talking about?\"\nAnd he answers -\n\"Well both Magoo's and Why Not\"\nThe questioner -\n\"Do they both have bands there?\"\nAnd he answers -\n\"No, no, Magoo's has a band, Why Not hasn't, it's got background music.\"\nThen the questioner -\n\"Mr Davidson, my recollection - now perhaps you can just correct me, my recollection of one of the bars, the Why Not or Magoo's or both, is that the windows to them are tinted.  Is that correct?\"\nHe says -\n\"That is correct, yes\"\nAnd the questioner -\n\"And it's not that easy to see in?\"\nHe answers -\n\"During the day it's difficult, but in the evening when the lights are on in the bar you can see through them\"\nOkay.

I don't know who's instructing him in that regard.  Then he deals with the Chamberlain incident and Chamberlain here is item 8 and he's included that within the purview of the items he seeks to rely upon.  Mr Mall represents the victims there, but he seeks to question on those as well.  Herein lies the difficulty Mr McBride and I have in regard to who he represents, where is that list.
