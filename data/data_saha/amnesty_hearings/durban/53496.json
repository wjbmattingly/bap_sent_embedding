He did lead evidence to the effect that he sacrificed his employment in order to bring about peace to his party and family.  He honestly believed that by removing these troublemaking IFP supporters, beginning with the two deceased from whom he is presently seeking amnesty, he would surely achieve the peace he so desperately sought.\n\tOn page 79 of the bundle I refer you to the learned Judge Combrink's statement in which he states at line 9, I quote:\n\"Two middle aged men, for no apparent reason except political differences were brutally murdered.\"\nSorry?  Page 79.  He had, I repeat, had two children and a wife.  This political warfare resulted in their deserting him.  Financially he is a man of straw so he cannot even begin to think how he could assist the bereaved families.  He appreciates his actions have caused the victims' families immense suffering.  He admits too that this is something he could not have foreseen.  Nor was it part of his agenda.  Such easy prey for political propaganda, coupled with the fact that his party persistently enjoyed losses in the hands of the IFP raiders.  He is paying the price for his political intolerance but he cannot escape the nightmares he experiences for his involvement.  He vows never to resort to criminal acts to achieve his political objectives, instead he wishes in the spirit of reconciliation to tell the truth, to reach out to all political opponents and to educate himself in party politics with the assistance of those more learned than himself.  To try to understand the other man's views instead of resorting to violence to achieve political objectives, such as peace.\n\tI humbly submit that my client has satisfied all the criteria as set out in the Act.  In the circumstances I humbly submit further that the Committee grant him amnesty as his actions fall within the ambit of Section 20, sub-section 2(a), (d), (f) and sub-section 3 (b) and (e).
