<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ... the legal representatives to identify themselves on record for the purposes of that record.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, my name is Ms Mohamed from the firm Dehal Incorporated, on record for the applicant Mr Nyathikazi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  I represent the victims of the Nyathikazi application, namely the Ntuni family and my name is S Panday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Panday while you represent the victims, how many are there that you represent?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Mr Chairman it's the Ntuni family, that's the mother and the brother who are present.  I'm given to understand that at the time of the incident the deceased was not married.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Did he have any children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ja, he may still have children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> No, from what I understand there are no children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> For what it's worth, I think only the mother then becomes the victim in terms of the definition of the Act, while his brother may very well be an interested party.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are they opposing this application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman, they are opposing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> On what basis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> On the basis that they believe that the act was not politically motivated and the basis for the non political motivation,  that the family recognises the applicant to have more criminal agendas behind the incident as opposed to political agenda.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Nyathikazi, what language would you prefer to use?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> Zulu.</p>

<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MS MOHAMED:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Nyathikazi, before you have a bundle of documents.  I'm going to refer you to that bundle of documents, okay.  Now isn't it correct that a copy of this bundle was handed to you at prison last week?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Have you read the bundle and familiarised yourself with the contents?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Thank you.  Now I'm going to take you to the bundle itself.  Isn't it correct that you've made two applications for amnesty, you filled in two forms for application for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Okay.  Now look at pages 1 to 3 of the bundle.  Is it correct that this is the first application that you filled in and it's dated the 22nd of ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> That's correct.</p>

<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Thank you.  Now on pages 14 to 18 of this bundle, there's a hand-written affidavit.

<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Now Mr Nyathikazi, isn't it correct that you are applying for amnesty for the murder of Zwelibanzi Ntuni which occurred on the 14th of April 1994?</p>

<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Sorry Mr Lax, I'm trying to ascertain whether he remained a member of the Street Committee throughout his membership of the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> When did you join the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> During the 80's.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And you remained a member until this incident?</p>

<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And you were part of that structure until this incident?</p>

<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> In Tanzania.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> And when did you return to South Africa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> In April 1991.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Now Mr Nyathikazi, I'm going to take you to the day in question of this incident, that is the 14th of April 1994.  Now on the day in question, were you in the vicinity of Road 8 in Chesterville?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> I was at Road 8.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Who was with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> I was with Jabulani Mzweli.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> What were you doing there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> We were distributing pamphlets about the upcoming elections.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Okay and then what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> We were on a motor bike in Road 8 when two men approached.  One was Zwelibanzi Ntuni and the other was Wiseman.  They came closer to us and asked are we continuing with distributing these pamphlets.  They then started shooting at us at which time we fled.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry.  Was the Wiseman, Wiseman Ntuni?  What's his surname?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> I forget his surname.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> And then what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> Jabulani was hit on the leg. but we managed to flee although we parted ways as we were running away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Okay now isn't it correct that at some stage you later returned to the scene of this shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Okay.  How did you proceed to the scene, in other words?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> I then went back to the scene.  On my way I met Sitembiso Msimanga and Robert Ngobane walking down the road.  They accompanied me are inquired what had been happening because they had heard gun shots.  I told them what had happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who were the two people, Robert Ngobane and who else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> Sitembiso Msimanga.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Tembo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> Sitembiso.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Okay and then what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> We later met Mondo Mkhize and they all accompanied me to go look for the motor bike and the pamphlets.  When we arrived at the scene, we could not find that motor bike, so we turned back along Road 13.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Okay.  Then what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> As we were walking along the road we met Mondo Mkhize's girlfriend.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> What's her name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> I have forgotten her name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Okay, then what happened when you met her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> Mondo and his girlfriend stopped and chatted for some time.  As they were parting, the girlfriend indicated using her eyes, pointing towards the side.  When I followed her eyes, I noticed some people standing around there.  The people were standing next to a tree in a certain house.  Mondo then went towards that house and went inside the premises.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> And then what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Tell me, why did you go back to Road 8?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> I went to look for the pamphlets that were left there, as well as the motor bike.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now if you had found it what would you have done with it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> I would have taken them back to my home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Which is where, of which was where?</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> It was in Road 15.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now Road 8 and Road 15, are they parallel to each other, or do they run off each other, or what?  How do you - okay, carry on, answer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> They are a distance away from one another.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Parallel with each other, or do they run at right angles or any angle to each other?</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> They are not parallel, they are far from each other and they are not in a straight line.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is the shortest distance one has to use to get from Road 8 to Road 15?</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> You go along Road 13 and then that takes you to Road 14 and then you would get to Road 15.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now is Road 13 at right angles to Road 8, or is there another way you could use ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> They are at right angles.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is there another route you could use to get to Road 15 from Road 8?</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> You could also go along Road 1, but that will take you longer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now these people who had objections to your distributing pamphlets and so forth, were they known to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> Yes, I knew Zwelibanzi well, but the other one was just a resident who was not close to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now were they known political opponents to...</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> One that I was aware of as being a political opponent was Zweli who to me was similar to an askari.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now did you know where he was staying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> Yes, he resided at Road 18.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I see.  And in Road 13 were there any known political opponents there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> Yes, prior to this incident, there were some people who resided at Road 13 who had been our political opponents, but that was no longer the case.  The war was over.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now, tell me, when you went back to Road 8, you say that you went there to recover the pamphlets and the motor cycle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you armed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> No I was not armed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you have intention of fighting with anybody at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> No, I did not have any intention at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now, when you went up Road 13, did you have any intention of fighting with anybody?</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> No, there was no intention.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now I see in your affidavit, you say that you did not - well, Ms Mohamed, this affidavit that I have is not signed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Sorry, Mr Chairman, the statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well whatever, it's not signed.  Have you got one that's signed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> I'm sorry ...(indistinct), but the contents have been read to him and he understood and confirmed that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, can I rely on the contents in order to ask him certain questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Yes, Judge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I see in this statement that you intend signing, you say you associated yourself with the ultimate action of killing the deceased on the basis that it was political.  Now I need you to deal with the following issue.  If you had no intention while being in Road 13 of even fighting with anybody, how could you associate yourself with the killing, on whatever basis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> At the time that he was killed, I was also present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But you had no intention to kill him, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> No, I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You didn't even have any intention of fighting with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> No, I had no intention of fighting with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And actually you don't know why he was killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> I learned about it later during that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ja, but at the time when he was killed, you didn't know why he was killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> At that time I did not know the reason.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you did not contribute to his death, is that not so, in any way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> I did not contribute anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, Ms Mohamed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Nyathikazi, I'm going to take you back to a point earlier in your evidence when you said that, this is the point at which Mondo's girlfriend made some eye signs and you followed her gaze to a point where you noticed people standing next to a tree and there was a certain house alongside this and Mondo then went inside that house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> Yes, that's what happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Okay, now where were you when this was happening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> I was standing on the road with Robert Sitembiso.</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Do you know why Mondo went into that house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> Yes, Mondo went in there to shoot at the deceased.</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Do you know whose house that was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> I only knew the son by the name of Hewa who resided at that home, who was a taxi driver.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Okay now when Mondo went into that house, what did you do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> I remained standing on the road.  When the gun shots went off, we all scattered in different directions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Could you see who was firing the gun shots?</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> And who was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> It was Mondo Mkhize.</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Now when you said that you heard the gunshots going off, you all scattered.  Where did you go to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> I ran towards Road 14.</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, can I just interpose.  Why did you run away?</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> I could not tell who was shooting who because I began to hear gun shots from the direction of the tree.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> But you've just said that you saw Mondo shooting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So who else was shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> I did not see anybody else shooting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So again, why did you run away?</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> I was trying to save myself, because the bullets were flying all over.</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Was that because Mondo was shooting randomly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> He was shooting towards the deceased.</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Well then how could bullets be flying all over, if he was shooting at the deceased and not in your direction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> There were shots that were coming from the direction of the tree and I was not sure if the people at that house were also returning fire, but I did not see anyone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You didn't see anyone shooting at you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> No, I did not see anyone shooting at us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Did you see any flashes of gunfire coming from that house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> No, I did not see any gunfire because there was a fence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Please continue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> I fled and later met Robert Sitembiso and Mondo Mkhize.  I inquired if no one amongst them was injured and they confirmed that no one had been injured.</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is Robert's surname?</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> Ngobane.</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> What else did they tell you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> It's only Mondo who told me that he has shot at the deceased and he was not sure whether he had died.</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> So when did you hear that the deceased had died?</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> I heard when I was informed that police had been at my home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Mr Nyathikazi, I'm going to take you to an affidavit in this bundle ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Before you carry on there, when you were in Road 13 and Mkhize's girlfriend indicated the presence of these people, as I understand you, you say this group of people were standing near a tree.</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And at some stage during your testimony, you said you could not see who was actually shooting, because they were at this tree, did I understand you correctly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> Will you please repeat?</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> For some reason you could not see who was shooting there in Road 13, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> I said Mondo was shooting but I did not see anybody from amongst those people who was shooting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, did you know who these people were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> I just knew the girls from the township as well as the deceased and Wiseman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Could you identify them when you were there standing in Road 13 when Mkhize's girlfriend indicated or pointed to this group of people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> I could clearly identify the men from the clothes that they were wearing on the previous occasion when they shot at us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you knew at that stage that they were possibly armed, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why didn't you run away at that stage already, because last time you had met them, they were shooting at you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> As I have mentioned before, there was a tree that blocked my view and they were also in the company of women, so I did not know whether they were armed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> But these were the people who had given you trouble before.</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Shortly before.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> According to you, at any rate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So why didn't you run away from your attackers, people who were not your friends, they were trying to kill you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> As I have already mentioned there were women, but I was worried because I realised that Zwelibanzi was amongst them.  This also happened very quickly, because when Mondo went inside the house, went inside the yard, he just started shooting and that was when I ran away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> How far were you standing from this house where the tree was in the garden?</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> I was on the road, perhaps on that opposite wall to where I'm sitting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> About four, five metres, just the width of an ordinary road?</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> Yes, it was a tarred road.</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you know Mkhize was going to go there and shoot the deceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> I did not know that he was going to go in there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Did you not know that that was the deceased's girlfriend's house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> I did not know that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> But you knew the deceased.</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> yes, I knew him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Well, didn't you know who his girlfriend was, if you knew him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> No, I did not know his girlfriend, I only learned about it at the trial.</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Mr Nyathikazi, I'm going to take you now to the bundle of documents.  Isn't it correct that you are aware that  Mondo Mkhize has put up an affidavit which is included in this bundle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> Yes, I'm aware of it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Now in that affidavit on page 20 in paragraph 11 Mr Mkhize sets out the reason for killing the deceased.  Now do you care to comment on that paragraph?</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> I would say that I was not aware that Mondo was going to do anything to the deceased, because as we had been together, he had not shown any signs of wanting to harm anyone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Yes, you were asked to comment on the reason he gives here and the reason he gives here is that there was a grudge between them.  He says he killed him out of a grudge, as mentioned earlier on, which I do not consider as political from my point of view.  That's what you were asked to comment on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> As I've already mentioned, I met Mondo on the way.  He did mention afterwards that he had killed the deceased because of a certain grudge, because the deceased had killed his friend.  I think what he wrote here was advancing his reasons that he had a grudge against the deceased and for him it was not politically motivated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Isn't it correct that you associated yourself with the death of the deceased in this matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> Yes, I did associate myself with his death because when he was killed, I was also present,  that is why I have applied for amnesty, for the reason that I was present when Mondo shot Zwelibanzi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I've never known a "deader" horse to rise.</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Sorry Mr Chairman.  Mr Nyathikazi, there's also an affidavit in this bundle which has been put up by Wiseman Ntuni.</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Now in his affidavit he says that Zwelibanzi was still a member of MK as at the date of his death.</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> I believe he has written so because the deceased was his brother and also for the reason that he had been to exile.</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Could I ask a question?  If you had a problem with this deceased, why didn't you just call him before the Comrades Committee of MK as existed in most places, and arrange for him to be disciplined according to your code?  If he was a comrade who was behaving badly, why didn't you just call him before the Street Committee or before the MK Committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> His behaviour indicated that he was no longer part of MK.  He behaved like an askari, so it was not easy to call him to a meeting where there would be people who would not necessarily be his comrades.</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Well, did you at least report him to your committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And what did you do ...(indistinct - speaking simultaneously)  Please continue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> Ms Mohamed we're waiting for you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Oh I'm sorry Mr Chairman.  Mr Chairman, I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS MOHAMED</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Panday, have you any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> In the light of the evidence produced, not too many questions at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I'm surprised that you have one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR PANDAY:</span> Mr Nyathikazi, isn't it correct that when the incident at Road 8 had completed, or when you were attacked in Road 8, that incident was completed and you had no intention of seeking any form of retribution?</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> I did not have any intention of retribution.</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> And isn't it also correct that you came across Mondo Mkhize by chance on the day in question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> Yes, it was not pre-planned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> And you would have no idea of what sort of plan Mondo Mkhize had against Zweli Ntuni?</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> No, I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> So finally isn't it correct that based on your evidence there is no way that you can be associated with the killing of Zweli Ntuni?</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> What associates me with his death is the fact that I was present when he was shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Isn't it also correct then that the killing of Zweli Ntuni by Mondo Mkhize was not political?</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> As far as Mondo is concerned, it was not politically motivated, but that does not apply to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Why do you say it does not apply to you?  You had no idea that Zweli was going to be killed on that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> I did not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> So if you did not know Zweli was going to be killed on that day, you cannot know about his intentions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> I did not know what he had intended.</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Now the family of Zwe Ntuni maintains that Zwe was an ANC member and supporter right up until the day he was murdered.  Why do you suggest differently?</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> I believe that Zwelibanzi in whatever he did, he may not have told them what his activities were at the time.  I may understand that they are heartbroken because they lost their son.</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> When did you learn that he is no longer an ANC member?  In what year did you learn this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> It was after a while.</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> In what year?  Can you recall the year that you learned that he was no longer ANC according to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> In 1993.</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> And did you report this to anybody?</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE POTGIETER:</span> It's hearsay, why must we - what is the value of this, he heard somebody say something?</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> I accept, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE POTGIETER:</span> How does it help us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> I accept the point Mr Chairman.  Thank you Mr Nyathikazi, nothing further.</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR PANDAY</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Just a few questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS THABETHE:</span> Mr Nyathikazi, according to a statement written by Lindiwe, the girlfriend to the deceased on page 29, she says she saw you, amongst others, and she took note of you because she knew you to be their enemies -  to be enemies with and you were harassing the deceased, Nkosinati Ntuni.  Do you want to respond to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> As a girlfriend, she had lost her loved one so she could very well say anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> And you were not enemies?</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> No, we were not enemies.</p>

<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Also I just want to clarify one more factor.  According to Noma Langa in her statement on page 33 of the bundle and Mantombi Ngobane on page 36, they both say that they saw you together with a group, you were all carrying guns, hand guns, yet in your evidence you've stated that you did not carry a gun.  What ...(indistinct - speaking simultaneously)</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> I was not carrying a firearm.  She may have seen us on the street, but it is not true that I was carrying a firearm.</p>

<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> I have no questions Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a>NO RE-EXAMINATION BY MS MOHAMED</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you, you're excused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ms Mohamed, are there any other witnesses you're going to call?</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> No, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Panday, have you got any witnesses to call.</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Mr Chairman, it's just the brother of the victim.  I'll just be very brief with him and that's merely to confirm his continued existence with the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Whatever, I mean you can call him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Wiseman Ntuni.</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">WISEMAN BHEKI NTUNI:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR PANDAY:</span> Mr Wiseman Ntuni, what is your relationship to the deceased Zwe Ntuni?</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTUNI:</span> He was my brother.</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Is it correct that you had deposed to an affidavit for the purposes of the application of Dannyboy Nyathikazi, opposing the application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTUNI:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> I'm just showing you pages 26, from page 26 to 27, is that the affidavit that you've deposed to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTUNI:</span> Yes, it is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> And do you confirm the contents of that to be true and correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTUNI:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Now in the evidence given by the applicant, he alleges that your brother Zwe Ntuni had defected from the ANC.  Can you comment on that evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MR NYATHIKAZI:</span> He had not defected, he was still a member of the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> And more particularly on the day that he was murdered, was he still a member of the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTUNI:</span> Yes, he was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Now in your affidavit in paragraph 4 you mention of there being gangs, Mondo and his gang, now do you know what effect this gang had on your brother, or were there any problems between this gang and your brother?</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTUNI:</span> They were a group of gangsters who used to shoot at one another in the township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> When you say:  "They were a group of gangsters), who are you referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTUNI:</span> I would say all of them belonged to different gangs, because Dannyboy belonged to one group and my brother to another, but this had nothing to do with the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What kind of gangs were they, tsotsies?</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTUNI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Interfered with the community and to fight against each other?</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTUNI:</span> They were fighting amongst one another.</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Nothing to do with politics?</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTUNI:</span> No, it had nothing to do with politics.</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> So at the time your brother, although he was member of the ANC, he was very much involved in a gang, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTUNI:</span> Yes, he was a member of a gang, although he also belonged to the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> And the gang that he belonged to was in conflict with other gangs in the area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTUNI:</span> No, they were not in conflict.</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Do you know of any problem that existed between Mondo's gang and his gang?</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTUNI:</span> I do not know what was the problem between them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Now is it correct that you are opposing the application being brought by Dannyboy Nyathikazi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTUNI:</span> Yes, I am opposing the application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Can you state the reason for you opposing the application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTUNI:</span> Firstly, I would say Mr Nyathikazi has told lies before the Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> What sort of lies has he told?</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTUNI:</span> That my brother had defected, had become an askari.  What is an askari?</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> What other lies has he spoken?</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTUNI:</span> This re-opens old wounds.</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> We need you to help us, Wiseman.  Can you think of any other lies that's he's given in his evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTUNI:</span> The lie that my brother was an askari.  Also that he was standing on Road 13.  How could he have seen him?  It is also a lie that my brother was preventing people from canvassing for the elections.</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How do you know that that didn't happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTUNI:</span> How could he do that?  Because he was young, I would have known about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Now tell me, the area that your brother lived in and the area that the applicant says they were canvassing, what political party dominated the areas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTUNI:</span> It was the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Now do you believe that the murder of your brother was politically motivated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTUNI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Thank you Mr Ntuni, no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR PANDAY</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS MOHAMED:</span> Thank you Mr</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a>Chairman.  Thank you Mr Ntuni.  Mr Ntuni it has been your evidence that the applicant was part of a criminal gang.  Now it's Mr Nyathikazi's instructions to me that he was never part of any criminal gang, can you comment on that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">MR NTUNI:</span> He is lying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS MOHAMED</p>

<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a>NO RE-EXAMINATION BY MR PANDAY</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you, Mr Ntuni.  You are excused.</p>

<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Have you got any more witnesses Mr ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman, we call Mondo Mkhize.</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who is that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> That is the first accused in the matter, Mr Chairman.  But before we call him, Mr Chairman, could we have a short recess just to confirm with him certain issues?</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is the point of calling him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> Well Mr Chairman, he was the accused ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> We know who he was.  You can rest assured we know who he was.  The Chairperson's question stands.</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> He'll merely verify the sequence of events that took place on the day in question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well has the been put in dispute?</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> It might not be so, it serves no purpose to call him as such.</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Have you got any other witnesses?</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">MR PANDAY:</span> No Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ms Thabethe, have you got any witnesses?</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> None at all, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that the end of the evidence?  Looks like it.  Ms Mohamed, have you got any submissions to make?</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">MS MOHAMED IN ARGUMENT:</span> Mr Chairman, apart from saying the evidence has been led and the applicant still seeks amnesty, I can't take it any further.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Panday, we don't need to hear you, nor do we need to hear you.</p>
