In which event I suggest the matter be removed from the roll and I believe reading the papers that is a matter that could be decided in chambers in any event.\n\tAs far as the application of Mr Mthembu and Mr Ngobese are concerned both applicants are present.

It is also, in someway, to tell his daughter that she is now old enough to have a boyfriend.  I was with my friend Mthembu who was wearing an IFP t-shirt.  As we were dancing there, we heard someone mentioning the word \"uklova\" which is a derogatory word referring to IFP supporters.  We ignore this because it was not directed specifically at a certain person.  After dancing outside, we went into the kraal of our host.

Because of the intake of drinks, we were singing and were in a very jolly mood.  We then heard these people shouting, asking who were the people making a noise there.  They then started using swearing words, and later said, \"Oh, it is these klovas.\"  Mshengu, my uncle Kikiza and myself then decided to approach these people, to find out from them why they were swearing at us.
