What I'm trying to establish is that if Mr Ndaba was an informer at that time and if Mr Ndaba told you all about the house at the Knoll, surely you would have had surveillance of the Knoll and if you had had surveillance of the Knoll, surely at some stage or the other you would have known that Mr Gordhan and I met.  Mr Gordhan, I was never questioned about any meetings of Mr Gordhan during the time of my interrogation which was quite alarming.  What I'm reflecting is that I am saying that most of your information you got from the computers and some information in the process which could not have been achieved from the computer was basically the personal interaction and that's why I'm throwing some doubt on the issue of Mr Ndaba.

We know that certain aspects of that evidence has been put into issue by yourselves and we know that from the nature and content of the questions that you have asked them.  However, if the way to contradict evidence is to actually give evidence as well because if at the end of the day we only have the evidence of the applicants and no other evidence controverting that, that doesn't necessarily mean that the evidence of the applicants has to be accepted because we examine the evidence, we analyse it, we deal with it in connection with the probabilities, whether there's self-contradictions, contradictions amongst that evidence, so it's not automatic that it will be accepted but if it stands uncontroverted by any other evidence, it's more difficult to reject, it's got to be inherently weak in order to have it rejected.  So I'd like you to think carefully before you make a decision as to whether or not you're going to give evidence bearing that in mind.

            "Thank you Chairperson.  Chairperson, I'm going to be brief.  This is an application before you for the assault on both Mr Gordhan and Mr Lalla.  One of the outstanding features here, Chairperson, is that there is no dispute about the method or the intensity of the assault as testified to by the applicants through Mr Gordhan's or Mr Lalla's cross-examination.\n\tChairperson, least I forget, the application for amnesty, I specified specifically assault at page 1 of D, Chairperson, or any other delict or offence.  I did not specify, Chairperson, the obvious one and that is defeating the ends of justice by not having reported it later but in line with previous applications, Chairperson, we will ask you to include that under that general heading under B.\n\tChairperson, Botha has given evidence on a number of occasions about Operation Vula.  You have documents before you about Operation Vula.  We know what it was more or less about.  What Botha said at the hearing when you were not present, Chairperson, was that he had received information - well, perhaps I should just fill you in on the background.\n\tBotha says he went to Swaziland in 1988 and approached Mr Ndaba directly to become an informer and Mr Ndaba did so.  Mr Maharaj gave a very good reason why that would have happened.  He said that at the time in 1988 ANC MK operatives in Swaziland was under pressure because the enemy was making life very difficult for them.  Perhaps that might have been the reason why Mr Ndaba decided to become an informer but that's not relevant why he did so.  Mr Botha says he did.\n\tThen Chairperson, in 1988 Mr Ndaba became the deputy commander of the Natal urban machinery of MK in Swaziland.  That was a very important event because Mr Botha explained the moment that happened his name automatically was placed on the list of Trevits who was security organisation composed of different sections of the security establishment in order to identify targets in other countries, particularly in our neighbouring countries.  And then Chairperson, what he did, that is Botha, is he suggested to Mr Ndaba that he should try to arrange for him to be recalled to Lusaka because Botha was afraid that Ndaba might be eliminated.  That's just a little bit of background, Chairperson.  He then gave Ndaba a name of a contact person in Malawi plus his address and telephone number as well as a contact person in Swaziland and his telephone number.\n\tThen Chairperson, we come to 1990.  According to Mr Maharaj, Ndaba came into the R.S.A. illegally on the 4th or the 7th February 1990.  That accords with the evidence of Mr Botha who says it was early in 1990.  Approximately six weeks before the 7th July 1990, Botha says Ndaba contacted him, it was a direct contact, telephonic and certain meetings were then held.  Botha could remember as I remember his evidence of two or three such meetings.  During this time Mr Ndaba informed Botha that he had become involved in an operation which was headed by Mr Oliver Tambo himself and he referred to the President's Committee and he gave Mr Botha certain information.  Mr Botha was quite clear that he was unable to recall what information was precisely given to him at what date but what is important, Chairperson, was that Ndaba was arrested on the 7th July by an askari, as it turned out later by two askaris.",

            "Saturday, 7 July.  Botha is called down to C.R. Swart Square and when he arrives there he finds Ndaba there and obviously he wants Ndaba to be released.  There's already a risk because an askari, as it later turned out, two askaris had knowledge of the arrest and Ndaba is then taken - and I don't want to dwell too long on Ndaba, Chairperson, but Ndaba is then taken to a safe house in Verulam where he is debriefed by Mr Botha.\n\tVery shortly after arriving there Botha is told by Ndaba that he has a prior arrangement to meet Mr Shabalala and to cut a long story short, Chairperson, due to circumstances prevailing at the time and what happened there, Mr Shabalala is arrested and also taken to the safe house.  As a result of information, Chairperson, received from Ndaba on the 7th and on the 8th July that weekend on the Saturday and on the Sunday, suddenly the light goes up for Botha and he starts understanding how this whole operation of the president's committee or whatever you want to call it, fits together.  He is given addresses of safe houses by Ndaba which are later confirmed, Chairperson.  I refer you to Exhibit H, that is the statement of evidence by General Steyn in the Ndaba matter where he quotes from the judgement of the magistrate in the bail application of Mr Nyanda where the addresses were confirmed as were other things for example weapons importation etc. etc. and because of this new picture, Botha informs Steyn and Steyn says lets go to head office which they do on Tuesday the 10th.

            "Just so, Chairperson, I'm just mentioning this as a matter of background and because it was raised but of course, Chairperson, the fact of the matter is that Operation Vula was smashed because of information which could only have come from Ndaba.\n\tNow if I may come to the present matter, Chairperson.  At the time there was suspicion of a mole, an enemy agent, in the security branch at C.R. Swart.  Mr Mac Maharaj confirmed that, that there was such a person.  This at once explained why about two weeks - well, even less, after the arrests of the Operation Vula people had been made, he went to Bethlehem to go and ascertain from Mr Gordhan who - what the identity of this person was.  He told you here that he had good reason to believe that Mr Gordhan knew who it was and that was in fact confirmed by Mr Gordhan's questioning here today, he knew who it was and the rest, Chairperson, are facts which you are aware of.  Mr Gordhan and I take it Mr Lalla, appeared to oppose these applications on the trite issues set out in the requirements of the Act, no full disclosure.  The closest that Mr Gordhan could draw the non-full disclosure is in regard to his arrest which is not to remain to the issues before you today.  The fact that the - as it appeared, Chairperson, from the questioning, that the assault would have taken place because of a personal vengeance or personal malice or spite on the part of Mr Botha, no basis is laid for that.  There's no evidence before you, tested under cross-examination which even vaguely hints at it except for the statements put by Mr Gordhan to Mr Botha.\n\tAnd lastly then, Chairperson, there might even have been a hint of disproportionality.  Mr Botha, with great respect, gave frank evidence before you.  He has made various concessions which shows and proves in our respectful submission his credibility and we submit in brief, Chairperson, there is no evidence at all to make a finding against Botha on any of the counts which I've just mentioned.\n\tChairperson, it is clear that also again from the cross-examination of Mr Gordhan that what took place on that day in July/August 1990 in Bethlehem had everything to do with a political background and political motivation.  It was quite clear that the armed struggle was still at the time proceeding, in fact the armed struggle was only suspended on the 6th August, if I remember correctly Chairperson, 1990 which is a date which follows the occurrences of the present incident and Mr Botha also gave evidence here to you to say that while the bomb attacks had diminished, other type of attacks were taking place particularly that in Natal or between the IFP and the ANC which was just another dimension as we all know, Chairperson, of the armed struggle.  So the armed struggle was by far not something of the past when these assaults took place.\n\tWe say, Chairperson, that it is clear on the evidence that has been given to you under oath that it was a very brief encounter.  Ten to fifteen minutes.  Chairperson, nothing turns on another fifteen minutes for that matter but the fact is that all the witnesses recorded to have been brief, it was not a savage assault and even if it was, Chairperson, amnesty also provides for savage assaults but the fact is, in our submission, it does appear to be proportional to the ends which Mr Botha intended to achieve.\n\tAll in all, Chairperson, we submit that you would not have a problem with the evidence of Mr Botha or for that matter of any of the witnesses.  The contradictions such as they appeared from the evidence are such as one would expect from honest witnesses attempting to recall what happened nine years before.  There was no inherent improbability in anything that the witnesses stated and there certainly wasn't a fatal contradiction between them on any essential part of the elements for which - of the incident for which they apply for amnesty.  \n\tWe would therefore ask you, Chairperson, to favourably consider that amnesty be granted to Mr Botha as prayed for.

Chairperson, may I just on that score and I don't want to take up more of your time than is absolutely necessary, we  have submitted very recently that perhaps, Chairperson, as you know that from the beginning we all have had difficulties with certain provisions of the Act which could have been a little clearer and one of the remaining issues, Chairperson, is - and I know very well what Commissioner de Jager's attitude about this is in specifying offences for which you apply for amnesty but the question really here is does the Act really expect the Committee to find on the facts which precise offences or delicts had been committed or is it not really the function of the Committee in the intention of the legislature simply to grant amnesty for all offences and delicts committed in the confines of a particular incident.  Now I don't want to take that much further but if my submission is correct that on a proper reading of the Act the interpretation must be that it is not your function and that all that is expected of you is to grant amnesty for any delict or offence committed specifying a particular offence.  Then Chairperson, all these issues fall away.",

            "I must however point out that as far as the last interaction about what is torture and what isn't and whether it's a human rights violation or not, the Committee might want to take into account that solitary confinement where you are a total captive to the whims, fancies, desires or otherwise of a group of persons who are there to perpetuate a racist ideology is one that must be considered a serious violation of human rights.  If one is in the situation where you have no contact with family, no contact with law, you only have contact with the lawyer, a doctor that they can choose, you have no access to your own medical personnel, you have only access to a bible, upon request you can get religious material of any other denomination, you have no access to reading material, they will only allow clothes that they deem fit that a family might want to send to you, they might allow an odd packet of biscuits to reach you from time to time otherwise nothing if they desire not to, you'll have a bath at their leisure and pleasure, you won't have it if they don't want you to have it, if you can shave if they want you to shave, you don't shave if they don't want you to shave and I can go on, Chairperson.  That's the condition in which people who subsequently played a leading role in both the negotiations for this country, that brought us where we are and in it's first democratic government were subjected to during the course of what we described as this set of events here.\n\tThe second thing, Chairperson, is Mr Visser has in the absence of Mr Maharaj tried to recapture his version or his interpretation of the set of events from 1988 leading right up to 1990.  I don't want to counter every fact or detail, all I want to say is that one needs to balance that out with the evidence that a previous Panel which included two of the people that are here heard from Mr Maharaj as a contrary or alternate set of facts.  But there is some interesting terminology used there when he says that during the weekend of the 7th and 8th when Mbuso Shabalala and Charles Ndaba were in the hands of Mr Botha and others, he used the word \"the light goes up\" and suddenly there's an understanding on Mr Botha's part of what were the circumstances that were prevailing in relation to the Vula project.  I submit to you, Chairperson, that how can a light suddenly go up when here for four to six weeks you've had free access to an informer who is allegedly working for you from 1988?  That at that stage no computer tapes, computer disks, computer material, computers or any other personnel were in the hands of the security police or Mr Botha but just having - and earlier I think we heard that Mr Shabalala was also not cooperative, so the same person who was the informant, having spent a weekend with Mr Botha, suddenly becomes the source of the lights going up.  I think that's a very dubious interpretation to be granted to the circumstances of that point in time.\n\tAs far as moles/informants accessed by the ANC in the pay of the police or security branch are concerned, there's a long standing practice in the ANC, Chairperson, at that time to actually recruit the police.  It's not something new, The Owl wasn't the first person to be recruited by the ANC, nor was it the last at that point in time.  So moles or informants who were connected to the ANC were a permanent feature of the struggle for democracy as far as the ANC was concerned.  Why there had to be this inordinate desire to suddenly find out who The Owl is and do it personally and then do it vindictively is something that in my view lacks credibility from the evidence that we've heard.",

So Vula, whilst it was a big operation, should not be seen in isolation from the history of the struggle that this country has actually gone through.\n\tReference was then also made to the fact that the armed struggle was still continuing at the point in time that the assault took place.  That's not true Chairperson.  The fact of the matter is that Mr Maharaj was detained on the 25th July, that in his pocket when he was detained was the actual draft of the ANC's proposal to be tabled in the discussions leading to the Pretoria Accord dated the 6th August 1990 which stated explicitly as the court itself will demonstrate that the ANC had the intention to suspend armed actions and that in any event was the implicit understanding that both the government and the ANC through the dialogue that they were having from February 1990 onwards and indeed prior to that, through Mr Mandela and Mr de Klerk, Mr Mandela and Mr Botha while Mr Mandela was still in prison.  That was the understanding that was already beginning to develop and to justify the assault on the grounds that either the Vula operatives or any other ANC operative was still engaging in active armed struggle is being less than frank with us.  Equally problematic, Chairperson, is to deflect the importance of what was happening here by making reference to problems between the ANC and IFP in KwaZulu Natal.

It is my view that in the first instance, Chairperson, although Mr Botha has been quite frank about the fact that he solely took the decision to assault myself and that he went through some of those details in a fairly frank way.  He still has not, I think, addressed sufficiently and persuasively the type of equipment if you can call it that and how it was obtained in my view and in that sense in part we do not have sufficient detail being put before the Committee about the facts of the matter.  As far as political motive is concerned, Chairperson, there's no doubt this was a personal decision, it was part of a pattern which I believe Mr Botha has practised within the police, he admitted that he has operated outside the law, he has admitted that the Minister wouldn't necessarily be informed about what's going on.",

But those laws are not followed, magistrates are ignored, district surgeons are not taken seriously so you have a paraphernalia, a set of mechanisms put into place which in fact are there for window dressing purposes and nobody actually took seriously.  One can only say, Chairperson, that a very high level of personal vindictiveness and culture of violence was or the previous position to violence was the motivating factor in this regard.\n\tAs far as proportionality is concerned, I believe I have addressed that, the bulk of the information was available already.  As far as moles are concerned there was no impelling reason to find out who that mole was in that point in time, information that we wanted we already had and many things were done with that particular set of information and in any event that particular mole called The Owl was not a unique phenomenon in the relationship between the ANC and the police at that point in time.\n\tFinally, Chairperson, I believe that as the previous president would say we will have had less than frank answers, I believe, in the submissions put to you that there is no serious remorse about the kind of actions that were taken and the approach of Mr Botha as far as reconciliation is concerned is still wanting in sincerity in my view and I want to leave him with an appeal that he think seriously, not in my case, but having been party to the killing of Mbuso Shabalala and Charles Ndaba, that he gives very serious thought to letting those families have the bodies of their people, let those bodies be buried with dignity and with caring by their families and that perhaps when all these proceedings are over he should at least cooperate in that final and very important step of reconciliation to leave their minds at rest.

Well, with respect Chairperson, I don't need to address you on those issues.

We've dealt with the personal vindictiveness Chairperson, there's no evidence to indicate that at all except statements made in cross-examination.\n\tChairperson, lastly as far as the mole is concerned, Botha tells you it was important to find out who it was and one can easily understand why.  This person probably had access to information about informers, about information about reports that came in etc. etc. which he could pass on to the enemy.  With great respect, Chairperson, if Botha tells you that it was important to find it out there's no reason to doubt that assertion.  That's all we have to say, Chairperson, in response and we again ask you to favourably consider the amnesty application of Mr Botha.\n\tJust perhaps lastly, Chairperson, the same goes for the alleged contradictions about times etc. etc., the contradictions were raised by Mr Gordhan, it wasn't raised by the applicants.
