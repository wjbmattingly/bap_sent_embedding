There's no suggestion that there was no source.  There's no suggestion that the source did not facilitate this.   That is not the case of the family or any other persons Mr Chairman, and I respectfully submit, the applicant Mr Pienaar at this stage, has made a full disclosure.  He said he made use of a source and he even went further, from questioning by my learned colleague Mr Moerane and indicating who that person could be.  In the circumstances, I respectfully submit, Mr Chairman, the only issue here is that the Committee must guard against disclosing the name of that particular person, as this is a very, very - a matter which must be regarded with great circumspection as far as that person's life is concerned.  Will that person not be killed?  She was already arrested by the ANC as you indicated Mr Chairman and that person was already questioned.  What will the other people do, the public at large, when they know who that person is?  That person might be living in this area, might be living elsewhere, we don't know and I respectfully submit, in the interests of that particular person, that name should not be revealed.",

These applications involve the unlawful killing of certain people, of 9 people.  The relatives of these people are here and they have come to find out how their loved ones were killed, why they were killed, by whom they were killed.\n\tNow, what we have so far Mr Chairman, are the identities of the persons who actually pulled the trigger.  We know why they were killed, if that will be the evidence of the rest of the applicants that these were ambushes.  We do not know, from the side of people who under normal circumstances would have been sympathetic to the cause of the deceased, who were involved.  I think it's important for the families to know who amongst the ranks of the ANC or their sympathisers was involved in the death of their loved ones.  The identity of that person, from my questioning of Col de Kock and from my questioning of W/O Pienaar, is a person who has made a statement, a statement before this Honourable Committee.  I haven't disclosed the name to those instructing me, but I don't think I should be privy to information to which those instructing me are not privy.  I think they should know what I know.  There's no reason for me to conceal from them information which they seek, information which is important to them, so that they also can begin the process of healing when they know the full facts surrounding the death of their loved ones.  I do not believe that this person is still a source or an informer of the police and I submit, Mr Chairman, that her identity should be disclosed.

That could be an order of the court and if that person is still an informer, Mr Chairman, it makes it even more complicated.  But at this stage my submission is that that person's life might be at stake.  Even if the people represented by Mr Moerane have no intention of doing anything to that particular person, there may be people close to them who have bad blood as far as that is concerned.  There is always that risk.  It's only a risk that's required, Mr Chairman, not a reality, just a probability.  Thank you, Mr Chairman.
