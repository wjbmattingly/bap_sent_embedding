<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Chairperson, the last applicant is ...(inaudible) for your involvement and participation in the assault of Mr Pravine Gordhan and you set out your amnesty application in the bundle found on page 22 which runs through up to page 26, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a>	That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR NEL:</span> Mr Bothma, you are still in the Police Service today, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> And your current rank?</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> I'm a Superintendent.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> During the assault of Mr Pravine Gordhan, what was your rank?</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> I was a Warrant Officer, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> And you were stationed at the security branch Durban?</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Firstly, do you confirm the correctness of your amnesty application as I have referred you to it in the bundle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> I have asked this question three times previously but it is necessary for the record.  Exhibits A, B and C serves before this Committee which was handed up and deals with the general background to amnesty applications as well as Operation Vula.  You have studied these documents and do you ask that these be incorporated in your evidence insofar as your knowledge goes and do you confirm the correctness thereof?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> Yes I do, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> And you have heard the evidence of Lieutenant Colonel Hentie Botha as well as the previous applicants.  Do you confirm the correctness of their versions of the events as it had taken place on the day of the assault?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> I do so, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> If I refer you to Exhibit J will you please read to us from paragraph 1 where the circumstances are explained?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> During 1990 I was a member of the security branch stationed at Durban.  I was part of a group investigators and at that stage we were involved with the investigation of the so-called Operation Vula.  During the questioning of one Pravine Gordhan I assisted Lieutenant Colonel Hentie Botha to suffocate Mr Gordhan in order to persuade him to answer questions which were put to him with regard to Operation Vula.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> What exactly do you mean that you assisted Mr Botha in suffocating him, what was your part in the assault?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> I helped in holding Mr Gordhan down on the ground.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Please continue?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> After it became clear that Mr Gordhan was not willing to answer any of Mr Botha's questions, the assault was ceased.  During the assault and at that stage I believed that my actions were aimed at maintaining and protecting the then government.  I was not rewarded and did not receive any benefit for my participation in the assault on Mr Gordhan.  I request that my amnesty application be considered favourable.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Thank you Chairperson, that is the evidence of Mr Bothma.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR NEL</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Nel.  Mr Visser, any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR VISSER:</span> Thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a>	Mr Bothma, before this date of the assault were you involved in any interrogation of Mr Gordhan?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> No, I was not involved in any interrogation, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Can you recall on the day of the assault what the subject matter of the questioning was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> The interrogation dealt with specifically the identity of the agent or double agent in the security branch known as The Owl and certain aspects with regard to Operation Vula.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Were you present from the time Mr Botha started speaking to Mr Gordhan right up to the end after he was suffocated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> That is correct, I was involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Please give us an indication of your memory as to how long the process had taken from start to end?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> Approximately between ten and fifteen minutes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And you say in your evidence-in-chief that it seemed clear to you, are the words that you used, that Mr Gordhan was not willing to answer, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Can you explain that, why was it so clear to you?  How did you draw this inference?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> Mr Gordhan, since the start of his detention right from the start, he was not cooperative.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> How do you know that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> We had to struggle to obtain his name and surname from him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> So did you indeed take part in certain questionings of Mr Gordhan before the assault?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> Right from the start of the questioning right up to the end I was present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And he did not cooperate, is that what you say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> No, not totally.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And on the day of the assault was that once again the case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> Mr Gordhan denied that he knew the identity of the mole or the informant within the security branch or that he had knowledge of the identity.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Very well, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR VISSER</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Mr Gordhan, do you have any questions you would like to ask?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR GORDHAN:</span> Yes Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a>	Were you involved in any of the arrests of Vula detainees?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> No Chairperson, I wasn't involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR GORDHAN:</span> Did you have a direct reporting line to Durban yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> No Chairperson, Mr Duhr did the report back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR GORDHAN:</span> The issue of cooperation seems to plague our discussions here.  Did you actually expect an ANC detainee to cooperate with the special branch official?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> Not really.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR GORDHAN:</span> From the moment that you and Mr Duhr stood up in that office, put the lights off, asked me to face the window, the hood goes on to my head, to the moment when the wrappings are finally taken off my body and the hood is removed, you will grant that trying to recall that nine years later it could well have been between twenty and thirty minutes as well, that whole duration?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> I doubt if it took that long, it might have felt that long for you, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR GORDHAN:</span> It could have been 25 minutes, 20 minutes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> Possibly 20 minutes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, before you proceed Mr Gordhan, if I could just intervene on this aspect.  Mr Gordhan said that he was placed, he was in this room or cell whatever it was and made to look out the window and the hood was placed over his head.  Where did that hood come from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> I don't know, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did somebody have to go out the room to fetch it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> That must have happened, it was not in the office where the interrogation took place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can you remember anybody going out or being asked to go out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> No Chairperson, I cannot recall that anybody specifically went to fetch it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And also it seemed from the evidence that Mr Gordhan was wrapped up in some sort of blanket or something, where did that come from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> Chairperson, it could have come from the cells I suspect, I do speak under correction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did this interrogation take place in the cell or was it in a special interrogation room or other office?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> The questioning took place in an office of the security branch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And then we've heard evidence also that some sort of bag, I think it's been referred to as a bag or a towel or some plastic was placed on Mr Gordhan's face actually suffocating him.  Can you say what was actually placed on his face when he was being smothered?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> Chairperson, if I recall correctly it was a piece of plastic.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Like a plastic bag from a supermarket or what sort of plastic?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> A plastic rubber.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> A thicker type of plastic, like a tube in a tyre?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you know where that came from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> No Chairperson, I don't know, it was also not in the office, it was brought there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And do you know how long you've had to wait more or less for this stuff to be obtained?  This hood and the plastic blanket?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> Chairperson, we did not wait for it.  When we started, when Mr Gordhan was wrapped up in the blanket the rubber plastic was already there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So what are you saying that when Mr Botha came into the room for the interrogation the stuff was available, this material?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> That is correct, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Gordhan?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR GORDHAN:</span> Chairperson, just to amplify on that and Mr Bothma I'm sure will confirm that, that at least four pieces of equipment if you want to call it that were required.  The blanket, the hood, the rubber/plastic, piece of material and a rope with string or some equivalent with which my body was tied and Mr Bothma will also I'm sure agree that there had to be an element of planning and premeditation in order that all of that would be available when the assault took place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> Chairperson, I don't know that Mr Duhr or I or I do not know that we had beforehand received instruction or collected these items out of our own motivation.  With Mr Botha's arrival there the things were there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think what Mr Gordhan's putting to you then, well just to follow on what he has putting, would you agree then that before the interrogation started, the interrogator must have expected at least the possibility of using that equipment before it started, otherwise why bring it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> That is correct, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR GORDHAN:</span> So I would have imagined that the same piece of equipment would have been used on Mr Lalla?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> I was not present with Mr Lalla but I believed that they used the same things.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR GORDHAN:</span> What is your - you're a senior officer now in the South African Police, do you see yourself as being loyal to the current government and what is your approach to the question of regret and reconciliation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> Chairperson, it's correct I am still in the police and I have the rank of superintendent.  I feel sorry for what we had participated in and it took place during the circumstances of those times along with the influences which were upon us and seen in that light and I regret the fact that it had taken place and I agree with the reconciliation process which is ongoing in the country and I support it totally.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR GORDHAN:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR GORDHAN</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Gordhan.  Mr Lalla?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR LALLA:</span> ...(inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ms Thabethe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> No questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a>NO QUESTIONS BY MS THABETHE</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Any re-examination Mr Nel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> I have none, thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Advocate Bosman any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> One question, thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a>	Mr Bothma, do you know why Mr Gordhan and Lalla had been detained in Bethlehem and not in Durban?</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> I don't know exactly what the reason was for it, I believe with my personal opinion, I think it was to prevent them contacting them contacting their families or all the other detainees.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Mr Lax?</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Just one thing, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a>	You've told us that this apparatus, these four items, were not in the room when this questioning commenced, there hadn't been in there at previous sessions, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Mr Gordhan, had he been questioned in that office before that in your presence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> Yes he was questioned in that office in my presence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And you don't know who brought those items into the room that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> No, Chairperson, I don't know if any of the other persons brought it there or who brought it there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Was it not Colonel Botha?</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> It is possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Because who else was in the room on that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> Myself, Lieutenant Duhr and Mr Gordhan.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So you have no recollection of who brought those items in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> No, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> I want you just to go back just for a moment.  We understand that Mr Botha left the room at the point he decided to do something else, is that correct?  At the point you ordered Mr Gordhan to turn around was Botha in the room or had he left the room?</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR GORDHAN:</span> Chairperson, I wonder if I could help to clarify that the initial questioning period of what I referred to as three minutes was at least an hour or two before the assault actually took place so in a sense it was two separate events.  If that ...(inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If you've heard what Mr Gordhan says, do you confirm that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> I would agree with it, I cannot recollect it hundred percent but I can agree with it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, I certainly didn't have that impression, that's a very helpful clarification if you like of the process of that day.  So are you saying that Mr Gordhan was questioned, were you present when he was initially questioned by Mr Botha?  That's prior to the torture?</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> Yes, I was present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Well tell us what happened then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> During that interrogation, Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> During the initial interrogation, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> Mr Botha came into the room, he asked very briefly certain questions to Mr Gordhan.  He did not obviously receive satisfactory answers to it and he left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And then what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> After quite some time, I don't know exactly how long it was, I cannot say whether it was ten or fifteen minutes or even an hour, Mr Botha returned and then the interrogation continued with the blankets and the plastic.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You see Mr Gordhan is suggesting it was over two hours later.  Well an hour to two hours, that's how he put it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> I don't know, I would speculate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> But it was a reasonably long period of time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> I really can't say, I don't know whether it was one hour or two hours, I cannot say that it could have been longer than an hour.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You see if you can't even remember that how can you remember how long the torture went on for, how can you be so sure that it wasn't more than fifteen minutes or maybe twenty minutes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> I am certain of the time that the interrogation and torture lasted, it was brief and the questions were asked quickly and it was clear that we would not get any answers from Mr Gordhan.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You see the question I want to know is why are you able to remember that and yet you can't remember what the intervening period was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> It's seven years ago, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Precisely, that's precisely the reason why I'm asking you.  I know it was a long time ago and that's precisely why I'm asking you why you're so sure about one thing but not about another?  I would expect that if you weren't sure about things you would be not sure about a whole lot of things?  Do you see my point?</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You see what Mr Lax is getting at Mr Bothma is you've said that as far as you're concerned the interrogation and torture process lasted ten to fifteen minutes, plus minus fifteen minutes, you gave a time and we got the impression that you were fairly confident about what you were saying.  Now you've been asked, you've been told that there was a gap between the first interrogation involving Mr Botha and Mr Gordhan and then the torture and you've got no idea as to how long that period is between the first interrogation and the torture, you've got no idea at all.  Now what Mr Lax is asking you is well, how can you then be so sure in your own mind that the torture lasted for plus minus fifteen minutes when you can't remember the intervening period, the length of the intervening period.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> The torture - the interrogation during the time when the blanket and all the other things were used, I was actively part of that, I recall it specifically although I'm not saying specifically that it was ten to fifteen minutes, it could not have been longer than that and the time period before, I cannot even recall what I did during that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You see, this goes back to the issue of how the items that were used for the torture were brought in and what preparations were made for that next phase of the interrogation and so on.  You've no recollection of that, did you not participate in that?  Is it that you did and you've just forgotten about it or you're not sure?</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> I am not sure how the equipment that we used arrived there at the office, I don't know who brought it there, that is what I'm saying.  I don't know.  It is possible that Mr Botha had brought it in, it's possible that he sent somebody else to fetch it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> To exclude the possibility that you could have collected and fetched it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> Definitely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You don't know what happened to Mr Gordhan in that intervening time, was he left in the office, was he questioned further by you or other people in the meantime?  Did you carry on questioning him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> I can recall he remained in the office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Was he blindfolded, was he handcuffed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> No, he was not blindfolded and he was also not cuffed.  He was only blindfolded during the second entry of Mr Botha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So at the time - so we go back to the start of the second phase.  You or Duhr tell him to face the window and at that stage he is then - the hood is put over his head or at least over his eyes, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Was Botha in the room already, did he enter the room while he wasn't looking, while Mr Gordhan wasn't looking?</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> I don't know whether Mr Botha was in the office at that stage because the lights were switched off.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So the lights were switched off and he was made to look at the window and then the process started?</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Was that - what was the purpose of that, to hide the identity of the interrogator?</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> No, I think it was to scare Mr Gordhan.</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Thanks Chairperson, I'll leave it at that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a>	You've said that the hood and the switching off of lights was in your view designed to scare Mr Gordhan.  Did you hear any threats being made to Mr Gordhan?  Threats and or any unkind statements like for instance "you won't see your family again"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> Yes Chairperson, threats were made to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Can you confirm he was sworn at?</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> It's possible, I cannot recall, it's possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are there any questions arising from questions put by the Panel, Mr Nel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> None, thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Visser?</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No thank you, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Gordhan?</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">FURTHER CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR GORDHAN:</span> Just a few Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a>	Mr Bothma, the offices you occupied were the offices of the security branch in Bethlehem and I imagine covering parts of the Free State region?</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR GORDHAN:</span> The head of that office at that time was - I think he was a lieutenant then, Lieutenant Robert-Shaw?</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What's that name Mr Gordhan?  Robert?</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR GORDHAN:</span> It's a hyphenated name, Chairperson, Robert-Shaw.  S-H-A-W.</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a>	Is it possible that Mr Robert-Shaw and his staff from Bethlehem might have given a helping hand to find the equipment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> I would speculate if I answered, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR GORDHAN:</span> And Chairperson, just to put some facts so that we clarify this a cession version, the first set of questioning that took place in respect of Mr Botha's role took place in absolutely bright daylight.  It was very brief as I said and that has been confirmed.  As it became dark both Mr Duhr and Mr Bothma walked in and out several times and they will concede that, they put their files away and so on.  As it got darker it was towards twilight, I was then asked to stand my back to the door, my face to the window and the hood was placed over my head, not just the eye, I just want to confirm those facts?</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR BOTHMA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR GORDHAN</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Gordhan.  Mr Lalla, do you have any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR LALLA:</span> ...(inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ms Thabethe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> No questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a>NO QUESTIONS BY MS THABETHE</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes thank you, Mr Bothma, that concludes your evidence.  You may stand down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
