<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a>Mr Chairman this is a matter that was adjourned from the Pinetown roll for convenience.

<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well thank you, Mr Prior, for your assistance and overcoming the various obstacles that have come before us.  As we have already said, and I will repeat, that if there is an opportunity to set matters down afresh, consideration should be given to where is most convenient to the victims, the implicated parties and also the community at large.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a>	There are a number of these matters which if heard in the right area would bring the community to the hearing and they would realise what is being done and the purpose of this.  I think that that is very important and we, the three members of the Committee will do all we can to help you in that, Mr Prior.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
