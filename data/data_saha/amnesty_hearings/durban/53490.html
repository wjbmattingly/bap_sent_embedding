<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Thulani Percival Cele.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> Thulani, I would like for you to start where the whole problem began.  I know you understand what you are here for and can you please lead the Committee or bring to the Committee what happened in your area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Molohlanye, are we to take it that the document before us that is headed "Affidavit", you intend to use and you would like to request that it be handed up to this Committee as an Exhibit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> I would like to apologise Chairperson.  I certainly would like this affidavit to be used as evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Let the record show then, that will be Exhibit A, that being the affidavit of Thulani Percival Cele.  Are you going to lead him on the affidavit, that is Exhibit A before us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> Yes Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can Mr Cele read English?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Would it not be better if you gave him a copy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> Yes, I will certainly do so, Chairperson.  You may proceed Mr Cele.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Won't you just repeat the question that you put to Mr Cele?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> Before you come to that, Mr Cele, may you briefly tell us how was your area during those years?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> The area in which I was residing, had been peaceful, but there were other neighbouring areas where there was political conflict, that is between the ANC and the IFP.  That is not including the area that I was residing in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> Mr Cele, then can you proceed to the affidavit and read all that is there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> With regards to the charges that I was convicted for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> Yes, I would like you to start as the Committee wishes to, that you start reading from the first paragraph.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We don't want him, Mr Molohlanye, to read.  You are here to conduct his application as a legal representative.  You know the requirements of the Act, you know the pertinent evidence he must lead before us in order to satisfy us, that he qualifies for amnesty.  We will read the affidavit as you proceed with your evidence.  Will you lead him in chief by putting questions.  We expect you to lead him in chief by putting questions to him, in that way he will give much more pointed evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Just before you proceed, may I just ask, Mr Cele, have you read the affidavit that you have signed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You know and understand what is in there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And do you again affirm it here to be true and correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You can take it that this is before us and if you would lead him on the (indistinct), I will appreciate it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> Thulani, which political affiliation were you in 1989?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> The ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> What position did you hold in the organisation, were you just a member or a leader?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> I was a leader in my area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> Please tell us, were you elected or were you just nominated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> We had discussed the matter, that is the residents of the area and the structure was formed and I was elected to lead that structure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> In this structure, who was also in the structure, were you alone?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> There were five of us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> Can you please give us the names of the other five members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You may lead him on this.  You may actually read out their names and ask him if he confirms the people you stated belonged to the structure that he has referred to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> In the structure, the other members were Bongumusa, Thami Mthembu, Nhlanhleni Makhaya, is that right Mr - oh, I left out Bongani Khumalo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> That is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> Can you please tell us why was this Committee formed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> There were some events taking place although the political conflict had not as yet reached the area, but there were criminal activities taking place, people were robbed in the streets and people actually robbed houses.  The people responsible for these acts were the AmaSenora.   We then met and discussed this matter as ANC members and decided on electing marshals who would be responsible for safeguarding the area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> Please tell us, during that time as you said, there were no fighting in your area, so what was the main purpose of the structure which you formed as the members of the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Unless you want him to state something differently, hasn't he just responded to the same question, the intention was to defend the community against the many criminal acts which were prevalent and committed by a gang called AmaSenora?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> Thank you Chairperson, for that.   What else did you discuss in the meeting with the community?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> We discussed various issues for example developmental issues because there was a scarcity of resources as well as the fact that we needed people to defend the area because people were robbed of their possessions like TV sets which they would be robbed of during the night.  Therefore our intention of forming that structure, was to make sure that we defend that community.  Another factor is that our area had members from different organisations, but there was no friction amongst the members, therefore we also wanted to keep the peace in our area, we did not want to see a situation that was happening in other areas, the political fighting happening in our area as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> Mr Cele, so you are saying that you formed the structure to guard the area.  Can you please tell the Committee what would have happened to a person found guilty of any offence or committing crime in your area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> That person would appear and be convicted for that crime.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> After the conviction ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> May I interpose, that person would appear before your structure?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes, that person would appear before our structure and the structure would decide his fate.  He or she would be convicted to a number of strokes or lashes and the structure would decide just how many.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You may proceed Mr Molohlanye.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> Thank you Chairperson.   After the meeting you had and the structure that was formed for marshalling the area, how was crime after that in your area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> The rate of crime deceased.  The incidents of crime or criminal acts would only take place when the criminals knew that most people would be at work, away at work, they did not commit these criminal activities in the evenings when people were at home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> So Mr Cele, as we now heard the background of your area,  can you please tell the Committee what led to your arrest and conviction in this and what ultimately led you to appear in front of the Committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> With regards to my arrest, around December 1989 some people came to attack me in my area.  They suspected me of having killed Martin Ngcobo who had been living in the area, although he was not born and bred in the area.  I heard that some people had arrived.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> Sorry to interrupt you, can you please give us a date when these people came to your area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> We understand that it is a long time ago, you could even lead him on the date.  I don't think that would be disputed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> Thank you Advocate.  Please proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> If I am not mistaken these people arrived on the 24th of December and I heard about their arrival in the evening of the 24th.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> Proceed sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> On the following day, which was Christmas day, I discovered that indeed these people were present although I was not certain if they had really come to attack me.   The rumour that I heard was that they had come to attack me, that would have been a revenge attack for the death of Martin Ngcobo.    My family then decided to send a message to these people, or rather she sent the message to Martin's mother and requested to see her.  Martin's mother, that is Diana Cele, came to my home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> I am sorry to interrupt you Mr Cele, it is not Martin's mother, it is Martin's girlfriend's mother?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> Please proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Nococanya Cele, Martin's girlfriend, also came.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> What happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> When they came to my home, they were asked if they had any knowledge about the people who were alleged to have come to attack me for the death of Martin.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> What was their response to that?  What was their response to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> They said that they did not know anything about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> After the meeting that you had between both families, what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> They said they had no knowledge with regards to these people, just what their business was, and thereafter we dispersed and they returned home and we also remained at our house.   At that time, there were also people, neighbours, who had also noticed the presence of these people because these individuals were actually making a lot of noise where they were residing at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> Sorry, you are saying they were shouting.  What were they saying when they were shouting and making a noise?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> What I heard distinctly when I went outside, it was not very far from my home, they wanted to know from the group that I was in, who was Thulani and I showed myself.  Although I could not see the person quite clearly, he said to me he was coming.  He said that he was coming and he was going to get Martin's hand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was this a female or a male?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> It was a male.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How many people were there, you are referring to people having shouted at you and having asked who was Thulani.  How many people were there who were making such enquiries?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> There were quite a few, they were at Amos' house and there were people standing around there, children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can you estimate the number, would you say a few, would approximate three, four, five or more than five persons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> I think if I include everybody who was at that house, they could have been more than 10.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did this include Diana Cele?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> No, she was not there, she was at her home at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And the 10 persons, were they all unknown to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> I only knew the people whose home they were residing in, but of the people who had come, I didn't know anyone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How many people were unknown to you in that group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> It was difficult to estimate because they would not all come out simultaneously, they would emerge one person or two persons at a time.  I only saw them together when we went to a meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You have referred to a group of 10 persons.  I want to know from that group, how many people were unknown to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> As I mentioned before, that number included the people or the members of the household, but I could not really estimate just how many these unknown persons were because they were not all there in the yard, they would come out a person at a time, or two people at a time, but they were not all together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Later on you were able to know who exactly you knew and who you didn't know.  How many people were unknown to you at the time when you escorted these people to the hills?</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> There were six boys that I found as well as one female, whom I only saw when I was quite close to them.  I knew this female.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You may go back to your examination in chief, Mr Molohlanye.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> Thank you Chairperson.   You said you were standing outside and you heard these people shouting.  With whom were you standing, were you alone?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> I was not alone.  There were neighbours who were also standing outside on my yard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> Can you tell us what happened after that, on the same date, on the 25th of December 1989?</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> I waited, waiting for them to arrive, but they did not turn up on that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> Were you alone waiting for them or did you have any company?</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> There were many of us.  There were other residents of the area present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> You waited with these people overnight or did they leave at any time on the 25th?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> We all waited until the following day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> When did they leave your house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> They left on the following day, about mid-morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> What happened after that, Mr Cele?</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> After they had left, and it was only myself and my family remaining and my family were all females, these people then came to my home, the very same people who had been in that house.  They were all male and amongst them I only knew Bunu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How many were they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> I think they were about seven.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you say amongst the seven persons, you only knew one person by the name of Bunu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes, that is the only person that I saw.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes?  Proceed and then what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> As they left that house, coming towards my home, there was a noise that erupted, people from other houses started shouting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> Did they finally make it to your house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> No, they did not enter the house.  They were coming along the road, but a lot of people came out running, out of their houses because my family and myself also came out of the house.  The females ran away and I proceeded towards Muandla's house, which was about ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> You said some people ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I didn't get the translation.  Where was Muandla's house?  The translation didn't come through?</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The applicant said the house was above theirs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Muandla's house was above the applicant's house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> So you say people came, people from the area came when they heard the women from your house screaming.  What did they do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> There were a lot of people who came running and this group could not then enter the house, they just took another route away from my house.  Eventually they returned to Amos' place where they were residing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> So you were still at Muandla's house?  With whom were you there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> As I was still at Muandla's house, a lot of people came to that house, that is people from the neighbourhood and some of my comrades.  We all converged at that house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> Only people from your area were at Muandla's house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> At that time, it was just the residents, neighbours who could, who had witnessed and could hear what was happening.  As they were still standing there, we were also a bit confused.  As we were still standing there, some people from a neighbouring area arrived.  There were many of them, I do not know how the message got to them or how they came to our area, but they were coming from Gangala.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> You were at Muandla's house, what were you doing there, just standing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> We were standing around, discussing this matter, still deliberating on what to do.  It was not easy for me to go back home at that time.  Muandla's house was level to the house in which these people were residing.  As we were still standing there, talking, this group of people from Gangala then approached.  They approached and passed Amos' house and proceeded to the house in which I was standing, that was Muandla's place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> What did you decide after discussing this matter with the community and after the arrival of this Gangala people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> A decision was taken to approach this people so that we find out who they are and what their purpose of coming into the area was.   We then left and went to Amos' house where these people were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> Please proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> As we got there, the house was surrounded.  Some people went into the house and these people were removed from the house.  We proceeded to that spot where we usually held our tribunals.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Kindly, you say we went to this house, but you were the elected leader, did you take a leading part in going to the house and entering the house and getting the people out of the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> As I explained before, people from a neighbouring area came and their leader, Nhlanhleni Makhaya, enquired from me as to what was going on and I explained the situation to him.  Then they suggested that we go and approach these people so that we find out the facts from them.  That was when we went to that house and we found them in the house, removed them and took them to that spot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> What happened at the place where you used to hold your meetings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> That is where we questioned them about their identity and the purpose of their visit, what they were going to do.  We then learnt that they were from Umlazi and from what they explained, they said they had come to get Martin's hand.  Apparently when the body of Martin was found, a hand had been missing and they had been told that I had that hand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> Did you ask them who told them that you killed Martin or who alleged that you killed Martin?</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes, I did ask them.  They explained that they personally did not have information, but they had been approached by Amos and Nococanya  who had informed them that I had killed Martin.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> You said you asked them what their political organisation was, what answer did they give you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> At the time, I was not the person who was questioning them but I do remember that they were questioned on that aspect.  Some indicated that they were not affiliated to any political organisation and some said they belonged to the IFP, and one of them said he was an ANC member.  I think Ernest was Martin's brother.   He was further questioned on the ANC and from his answers it became clear that he did not have any knowledge with regards to the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> What happened to these people after the questioning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> May I interpose before you proceed?  What was the purpose of questioning these people about their political affiliation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> The reason for that was because of the circumstances.  We had expected that if there was a person who was concerned about Martin's death, we would have expected that person to go to Martin's house, but when we questioned Martin's family or the people that he had been living with, they denied any knowledge of these people.  That was why we questioned them because we also suspected that they may have been members of AmaSenora or members of the IFP.  We wanted to know as to why they had been there, maybe they were using Martin's death just as an excuse to attack the people in the community or if they had been really sent to revenge Martin's death.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who was doing the questioning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> There was Nhlanhleni Makhaya, he posed the questions although there were other people who also posed questions.  I, myself, also asked some questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What questions did you personally ask?</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> I asked them if they had found Martin's hand, what would they have done thereafter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, and what was the response thereto?</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> They said they would have just taken the hand and returned home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Nhlanhleni Makhaya is the leader of Gangala Youth League of the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You were not a member of Gangala Youth League?</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> No, these are just neighbouring areas but later on, we joined forces and worked in collaboration with one another because if there were people who were safeguarding our area, they would also do so at Gangala and vice versa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> As at the 25th of December, you were not a member of Gangala Youth League?</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> No, I was not.  I belonged to Manyaseni.</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> As at the 25th of December, was there some kind of co-operation between Gangala Youth League and the structure in which you were a leader, Emayaseni?</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes, there was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What kind of collaboration do you have?  Did you have co-operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Prior to the 25th, there was co-operation because the people who committed these criminal acts, did not demarcate just where they attacked, but they would rob any house, be it in my area or in Gangala, such that when we heard of these acts, regardless of where they were committed, we would all go and investigate.  Even if I was away at work, I would be assured that Nhlanhleni would also keep an eye on my area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you, thank you Mr Molohlanye.    You may proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> Thank you Chairperson.  You said you questioned these people and what happened after questioning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> After that questioning, after we had learnt that the purpose of their arrival was to attack, because we also found some firearms on them, we then held a separate discussion to discuss what to do with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> What decision did you come up with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> The decision was taken to attack them so that they do not repeat what they had done.  It was also decided that the people or the family that had been hosting them, should also be attacked, particularly their son so that they do not in future, fetch people from other areas to come and attack us in our area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Sorry for interrupting, I think you are losing me.  I heard you say that on questioning they said that they came to look for the hand of Martin.</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And that you specifically asked them, had they found the hand, what would they have done and they said they would take it home?</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So where did you learn that they came to attack?  I didn't hear you say anything that they told you that they came to attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> We deduced this from the questions that we asked them as well as the fact that they were armed.  Another factor that influenced me to think so is because Martin had been buried for a very long time, such that there was not really any expectation from them to find a hand ... (tape ends) ... it was early in December.</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> If this happened still in December, why would they be looking for a hand?</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> The amount of time that had lapsed between then, was long.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Were you armed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> What arms did you find on them, what weapons did you find on this group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Firearms, three firearms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> When you went to take them out of Amos' house, did they not show their arms, did they not try to defend themselves?</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> No, they did not attempt to do so because when we arrived there, we surrounded the entire house, it was not easy for them, it would not have been easy for them to do so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> When they first approached you to your house, from where the women ran away and your an away, they didn't show their arms then, they didn't show their firearms then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> No, they were asking me questions, they were not very close to me because they were standing at Amos' house and I was at my home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But if they really wanted to attack you, why would they not have taken out their firearms there and attacked you there at your house when you were alone with only the women?</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> I do not know.  Maybe they did not know just who was present in my home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But hasn't it been your evidence that as they were approaching towards your home and the women in your house, fled when seeing these people approaching from a distance, people in the neighbourhood then came and these people were stopped from getting into your house because of a large number of neighbours who came in towards your house, when they saw these people coming towards you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes, I did say so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> How far is Amos' house from Muandla's house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> It is not very far.  If you shout, if you call out to somebody there, they would be able to hear you if you are shouting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.  You took a decision and then these people were sjamboked, how many strokes did they get?</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> 300 strokes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> 300 for males or for both genders?</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> The males were lashed 300 strokes, the females were given only 50 lashes, expect for Dudu who was lashed for 200 strokes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> Dudu was present at the time that these people were punished?</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That is not his evidence, shouldn't you put a question which would not be leading, or not even leading, confusing him, because that has not been his evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> Thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was Dudu present when you administered the punishment of 300 strokes initially on the approximate seven persons that you took up to the hills in the place that you called "The People's Court"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Initially when the house was surrounded and these people were taken away, she was not there, but she was later present.  That is after some people went back and found her there at the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That is quite apparent from the contents of paragraph 14 of your affidavit, is that not so, that you found Dudu later on, hiding under the bed after the other persons had been punished?</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You may proceed Mr Molohlanye.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> Thank you Chairperson.  So, you told us that Dudu was sjamboked 200 strokes.  What happened after that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Dudu was the last person to be sjamboked and she was told to pack her stuff and leave the area, never to return.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> Please proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who was giving such instructions, can you be more specific?  Was it yourself or was this Nhlanhleni Makhaya?</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> I am the person who said so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, and what happened thereafter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> She left thereafter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> Proceed, after she left, what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> The people that she had been with, had left Amos' house.  A car approached and there were comrades in this car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> The comrades were from Amadiqwe, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Isn't that leading?  Why should you lead him, that is not so innocuous.  Where were these comrades from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> They were from Amadiqwe.  There may have been some who were not from the Amadiqwe area itself, but from a neighbouring area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you know them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> I did know some and some I did not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How did you know that they were from Amadiqwe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> I knew, the people that I knew, I knew them from Amadiqwe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How many were they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> It is not easy for me to remember just how many there were, but there were many of them, they were travelling in a kombi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  What did they do on arrival?</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> They enquired just what decisions had been made because when they arrived, the people who had been sjamboked were no longer there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How did they know that a decision had been made at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> When they arrived, people were dispersing, returning to their homes.  They met us along the way, that is when they asked us just what had been going on, what decisions had been taken from that rumour that they heard that there were people who had come to the area to attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How did they know that people had come to the area to attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> I do not know who had contacted them.  I was not even expecting them, I just saw them arriving there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Around what time was it when they arrived there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> It is not easy to remember, but they arrived after everything had taken place, they were the last to arrive.</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can you approximate, I know it is difficult for you to do so, but is it possible for you to approximate as to how long it took you to get the persons from Cele's house, march them up to the hills where you usually held your "People's Court", administer the lashes, go down to look for Dudu, find her, administer some lashes on her and tell her to leave, how long did that take?  Do you think it could have taken a few minutes or it took some few hours?</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> It must have been hours.</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How far is Amadiqwe from your place which is Manyaseni?</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> It is not that far.    If I can estimate, I will say from where we are now, it is from here to Durban station.</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.   You may proceed Mr Molohlanye.</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> Thank you Chairperson.   When they arrived, what decision did you take with these comrades from Amadiqwe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> When the comrades arrived, they didn't agree with the decision we had taken.  They said we were not supposed to just slash them and let them go because now we are giving them a reason to go and attack us.   That was the decision we were taught that we were supposed to kill them, not to slash them or stroke them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> What did you do after that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> That is when we left, we went straight to Mr Amos' house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> Can you proceed and tell us what happened at Amos' house and thereafter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> When we went to Mr Amos' house, we were not walking but we were running.   The people who were there, they ran away.   When we arrived there, since there was no one, we burnt down the house.  The people who were there, had already left and the people whom I saw there were children, they were playing outside.  We tried to chase the people who were running and they were not running to the same direction.  We couldn't get hold of the males, the only person we got hold of, was Dudu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> Were you present when she was caught?</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes, I was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> What happened to her after she was caught, will you please tell the Committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Just a moment please, could I just get clarity here.  That was after Dudu had been lashed, had received 200 strokes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> So she couldn't run at that stage or could she?</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> She tried, but then she didn't have enough strength because she was a female and the males were chasing her.  Other people who were slashed 300, they could run away and they did succeed in running away, but she couldn't because she was a female and the males were chasing her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, Mr Molohlanye?</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> Thank you Chairperson.  You said you caught Dudu, what happened after that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> She was beaten up, it was in the street.  She was beaten up to death.  That is where she died.</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> How was she beaten?</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Some were kicking her, some were beating her, some were throwing stones on her, I think the stones actually killed her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> What was your role during that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> I also threw a stone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> So you were involved in the beating and kicking of her, of Dudu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> The only thing I did, I took a big stone and I threw it on her.  I didn't kick her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Will you please look at the last sentence of paragraph 14?  You say there right at the bottom</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a>"... I also joined in kicking and beating her with stones until she died."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a>	Do you see that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Do you remember that I asked you whether you had read the statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes, I do remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And I asked you whether everything was true and correct and I think you said yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Now, did you kick her or did you not kick her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> No, I didn't kick her.  I took a stone because I wanted something to finish her quicker.  When I arrived there, so was already laying down and I took a big stone and I threw it on her.  Others kicked her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Were you not pursuing Dudu when you ran after these people, did you not say you followed the group who pursued Dudu?  If I can explain, if I understood you correctly you were splitting up in different groups, pursuing these people running away.   I understood you to say you were following Dudu, I may be mistaken?</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes, that is correct.  When the people left Amos' house, there were many and they were running towards one direction but, because there was a sugar cane or sugar field, some of them ran into the sugar field.</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Where did you run?</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> I ran to the road.  First I proceeded in chasing Bunu, but then Dudu was running on the street and not into the sugar cane, then I ran towards Dudu, I joined the group which was chasing Dudu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did you catch Dudu?  Did you get hold of Dudu, did you catch her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> We didn't arrive there and catch her or hold her, what happened is that once she was there, that is when we started throwing stones and some of them kicked her.  There was no time for us to hold her or to actually grab her, once we arrived there, we threw stones and we started kicking her, she fell down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And you threw only one big stone, you said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> I tried the small stones, but then one thing I know or one thing which was profound is that I took a big one when she was laying down, and then I threw it on her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did you throw, you first threw some small stones, is that what you are saying?  What was your part, you need to tell us unfortunately.  How many stones did you throw at her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> It is not easy for me to actually count the stones, we were too many and too many people were throwing stones.  The reason I took a bigger stone is because I thought that we were going to hit each other with the small stones and I took a bigger stone and then I threw it on her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> How big was this stone, can you point us, can you show us with your hands?</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> He is actually showing the size of the stone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I would say that is about 30 cm's in diameter.  Was it a round stone?</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> No, it wasn't a round stone, the shape is not as round, but we can say it is almost round, but not round.</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you recall the evidence that was led by one of the Policemen at your criminal trial in which the stone was described, would you say it was, the stone that you threw at Dudu, that was described during your criminal trial, the big stone that was discovered next to her body?</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes, I can agree.</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And that was the biggest stone that was amongst the other stones, discovered around her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes, I can agree with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Where did you hit her with this big stone, what part of her body?</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Her head.</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> And did the stone crush her head?</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> I am not sure, I just threw the stone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But the simple question is the stone that you threw at her, you threw it on her head?</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Can you just explain to me, I find it difficult to understand that the other people apparently six of them that got the lashes, they were also in Amos' house when you went running to the house, they fled from Amos' house, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And they each had just received 300 lashes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And you were quite a large group of able young men, pursuing these would-be attackers that were now fleeing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes.   Let me just explain there, as I have already  explained, I said after we slashed these people, we allowed them to go back and some of us, our group, we started dispersing and then later, when they saw that we were running back to Bunu's house, that is when others came back, not all the group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> No, but at least the people, the comrades from Amadiqwe were with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And some other people from your comrades that were involved in the lashing and in the court, the tribunal, your neighbours, there were quite a number of people present.  Who ran towards Amos' house after the people from Amadiqwe arrived?</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Many.  I was one of those people, but we were many.</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And six people fled from the house, plus Dudu, but you couldn't catch any of the six?</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> No, we didn't catch them, they ran away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> After you had lashed them, why did you allow them to go back to Amos' house if they were not from the area, why didn't you show them out of the area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> They did request that they needed to go to Amos' house because they left their clothes or their belongings there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And that initially you were quite satisfied to leave matters as they were, to give them lashes and to let them go and to give them a warning never to come back to your area again, is that not so?  It was only when the group, the comrades from Amadiqwe came in and told you that it was not wise to simply let them leave the area, but that you had to kill them, that you then decided that they should be killed?  That is how I understood your evidence, is it not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes, that is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Sorry, why did Dudu have to be killed because Dudu was from the area or not?  Was Dudu also from another area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> She came with them.  She was the one who was supposed to show them me, because they didn't know me and she knew me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> All right, sorry then, can you just explain to me how did she know you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Dudu was Martin's sister, she did come to visit the area before and left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did she visit often?</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> She never used to frequent, but she would come and visit the area, even my place, she would come to my place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Wasn't she the sister of Martin?</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes, she was Martin's sister.</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> And didn't she call out at you and asked for the hand of her brother?</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> No, she didn't.  A male person shouted for Martin's hand, not her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You are however, aware that evidence was led during your criminal trial to the effect that it was Dudu who called out, asking for her brother's arm and that during your criminal trial you maintained that it was not a female voice, but a male voice that called out.  You still stand by that version you gave during the criminal trial, that it was a male voice and not a female voice?</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes, I still stand that it was a male voice.</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> When these comrades from Amadiqwe arrived, they came in a kombi you said and there were many of them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes, a full load of a kombi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did they alight from the kombi, did they get out of the kombi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> They alighted the kombi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And did you stand at the kombi and tell them at the kombi what happened?  Was there a meeting with them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> They alighted the kombi and they came to us and we met with them, that is when they started questioning us and we explained everything to them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And you stood at that place where they met up with you, where they said you should have killed the people, not lashed them only?</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes, I was present there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> How did the decision, how was the decision taken to attack Amos Cele's house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> At that time, while we were standing there discussing, that is when we took the decision, because what they explained to us, we realised that what they are saying, was true, that if we let these people go freely, they are still a danger to us, they will come and attack us later and we also realised that they were still at Amos' house, they hadn't left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> When was Amos' house burnt, before Dudu was killed or after Dudu was killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Before Dudu was killed.   When we ran towards Amos' house, and when these people who were there, fled away and when we tried to chase those who fled away from Amos' house, those who remained at Amos' house, that is when they burnt Amos' house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did you take part in the burning of Amos' house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> No, I was chasing those who fled Amos' house and those who remained behind, they are the ones who burnt down Amos' house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Molohlanye, we request your indulgence, we deviated a bit from - you were still leading your evidence in chief.  You may proceed to do so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> Thank you very much, Chairperson.   You told the Committee that Dudu was kicked and you threw a big stone on her head.  What happened after that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> We left her there and no one was arrested at that time.  We realised that we didn't catch the others who also ran away, we decided that we were supposed to hold a meeting the following week, we all went to our respective homes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> Mr Cele, in your affidavit, paragraph 15, there is a last statement that you made.  Do you still hold that statement that you made in this affidavit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> What I know or whatever I took part on, it ends here, but when we were in a criminal court, I found out that I was told that I was also involved in other crimes, which I didn't take part.  I don't know of the other incidents or crimes which were committed after.   For instance Amos' murder, I didn't take any part, I was told that I was involved, but I wasn't there when he was murdered.</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Could you kindly explain to me, you were the Chairperson of this Association that you founded there to protect the people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> No, I wasn't a Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Oh, but you were the leader of the group you formed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Your function as a leader, did you also sit in on the Court who would sentence people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Were you ever present at a Court meeting where it was decided that Amos should be killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> No, I wasn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Do you know whether there was a meeting who decided that Amos should be killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> No, I didn't know of any meeting because Amos was killed immediately after Dudu's murder.  The situation at the time in our area, was so bad that Police were always there, were always around.</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> That day when you decided that Dudu should be killed, you also decided that the other people involved with her, should be killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Was Amos one of the group of people that should have been killed on that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> No, Amos didn't run away and we didn't take a decision to kill Amos.</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Afterwards, after you had heard about Amos being killed, what was your attitude about his killing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> If you could please repeat this for me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Do you think that it was a correct thing to kill Dudu at that stage, not now, at that stage, did you think that Dudu should be killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes, at that time, at that stage I thought it was a correct thing to do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Right, now at that stage, was it the correct thing to kill Amos also?</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> No, I didn't see that as a correct thing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Right, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> May I with your indulgence Mr Molohlanye, I am getting a little confused with your evidence, Mr Cele, and this is really meant to assist you, I hope you understand that.  Let me encapsulate your evidence as I comprehend it thus far.  You have this meeting which happens at the hills where you usually held your "People's Courts", you decide to administer some lashes on the group that you had with you at that time, which did not include Dudu.  You proceed to impose a sentence and you proceed to meet out punishment on that group of people who you estimated to be approximately seven.   You then decide that Dudu must be located, you go back to the house, you search the house, you find Dudu hiding under the bed, you take her up to the hills where you again impose a sentence of 200 lashes on her and proceed to administer that sentence.   At about that time, the comrades from Amadiqwe arrive in a kombi, they then give you some kind of wisdom about the decision that you had earlier on taken, and you then agree that these persons should not only be assaulted as you had already done, but that they should be killed and not only the people who were from outside your area, but those who assisted them which would mean Amos Cele and the people who were staying at his house.  You agree with that decision, as a result of which you go to Amos Cele's house, precisely to carry out the decision that you have now taken jointly with the comrades from Amadiqwe and that is no longer to allow these people to leave, but to kill them and kill those people who had harboured them, that would be Amos Cele and his people.  This is how I have been understanding your evidence.   As it turned out, Amos Cele is not in the house and these people see you coming and they start dispersing in different directions.  You then split into various groups, the others remain behind and they burn down Amos Cele's house.  It is quite obvious to me the way I understand your evidence, that you had decided to kill these persons as advised by the comrades from Amadiqwe and that would include Mr Cele, Mr Amos Cele?  Is that not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> No, that is not so.   The people from Amadiqwe, they only told us that we should kill the people who came to the area.  We didn't even look for Amos, in fact when we arrived from Amos' house, the females were there and they were playing, even the kids were there.  We didn't go after them, even though we had given or administered some strokes to them.  We only chased the people who were not from the area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In that case, I have not understood your evidence and I will request you to come back to this aspect which I consider quite essential to your case, to your application.  What decision was actually taken with the comrades from Amadiqwe with regard to those people to whom you had administered lashes because you had administered lashes not only to people who were outsiders, you had administered lashes even to those people who were not from Umlazi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What decision was then taken by the comrades from ... (tape ends) ... repeat that evidence, it is very important, we have to understand you properly on that aspect of your evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> The comrade from Amadiqwe said to us we were wrong in just administering strokes to these people because we are allowing them to go back and arm themselves and come back and attack us.  The easy way was for us to go after them and kill them.  When  we left there, we went to Amos' place in order to kill only the people who came from Umlazi.  Things like burning down Amos' house, we didn't take any decision about that, but people who were there, who went there to attack the people from Umlazi at Amos' house, decided there and there to burn down his house, but the decision was not taken by us and the people from Amadiqwe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So those who then burnt Amos Cele's house, did so outside the decision that was taken in conjunction with the comrades from Amadiqwe, is that what you are saying?  The burning of Amos Cele's house was not part of the decision taken?</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes, that is true.  The decision wasn't taken there, but it was a usual thing at that time that when someone was going to be fetched somewhere, in a certain house, the house was going to be burnt, this was a usual thing, this used to occur all the time.  So people just decided there and there to burn down the house, not that the comrades from Amadiqwe came with the idea.</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Confine your response to questions pointedly put to you, I am not asking you about what used to happen.  I want to know about the decision that was taken.  It wasn't decided to burn Amos Cele's house, that wasn't the decision that you took jointly with the comrades from Amadiqwe?  Yes or no?</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> No, we didn't take that decision, the only decision which was taken was that to kill the people who came from outside the area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, so how them do you state in your affidavit that you decided that the house should be attacked, because that appears in your affidavit, paragraph 14, line 5?  Let me read it out to you, you state then it was decided, maybe I should start one line up</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a>"... then as they were leaving ..."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a>	you are now talking about these persons to whom you have just administered some lashes -</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a>"... a kombi with comrades from Amadiqwe arrived who were not satisfied with the sentence.  Then it was decided that Amos Cele ..."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a>	I suppose it should have been Amos Cele's house ...</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a>"... should be attacked."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a>	Are you saying that portion of your evidence is incorrect because that is how it stands and that is how I comprehend it, that this was your decision?</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes, we didn't talk about burning Amos' house, we only decided that we were going to attack his house and take the people who came there, or the people he had harboured in his house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What did you literally mean by attacking his house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> We were going to look for the people who were in his house, because they were together with Bunu, that is Amos' son, because he was the one who was involved with these people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you suggesting that it was your intention also to kill Bunu because, is it Bunu or Bonny?</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Bonny.</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Bonny, yes, I think it has been incorrectly translated as Bunu, Bonny, are you saying therefore that it was your decision to kill Bonny as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes, he was going to be killed because the Amadiqwe comrades did ask who was with the people who came to attack us and we told them that they were with Bonny.</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was it your intention to kill Bonny or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> If we did find Bonny, we were going to kill him because he was the one who came with these people from outside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you not aggrieved by the fact that, you obviously were aggrieved by the fact that Bonny was there with these people whom you thought had come to attack you?  You were aggrieved by that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes, I didn't like the idea.</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  Were you therefore also not aggrieved by the fact that Amos Cele had dared to accommodate these people in his house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> No, at Mr Amos' house, there were many houses.  There was also Bonny's house and these people were actually harboured at Bonny's house, not the main house which was Bonny's father's house, or Mr Amos' house.  They were not from the main house, Mr Amos', they were from Bonny's, the outside house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So far as you were concerned, you were happy that they should be inside the main kraal of Amos Cele as long as they didn't come from the main house, even though this was his kraal, you were happy with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> The truth is I didn't like that, but I knew that if Bonny wasn't there at Mr Amos' house, there were not going to be people who will come and attack us, because Amos was an old man, but the reason they were there, it was because of Bonny.</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  How do you explain then the anger of the other people who were with you, who then decided to burn not Bonny's house but Amos Cele's house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> That wasn't the correct thing to do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Molohlanye, you may proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> So my last question was, do you still hold the statement Mr Cele, the last one in paragraph 15?</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> If so, thank you Chairperson, no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MOLOHLANYE</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Molohlanye.  Ms Thabethe, do you have any questions to put to Mr Cele?</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Madam Chair, I do but before I pose any questions, I would like to ask for a ten minute adjournment, there are a few issues I need to clarify before I proceed with my cross-examination.</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You have in chambers indicated to the Committee that the relatives of the deceased and the victims, were present and that it was their intention to oppose this application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> That is correct Madam Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you now seek an opportunity to consult with them with regard to the evidence tendered by Mr Cele before you can proceed to put questions to Mr Cele?</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> That is correct Madam Chair, I have consulted with them, but there are a few issues I need to clarify.</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think we will take a lunch adjournment, and we will reconvene at half past one.  Will that be sufficient for you to consult and still have something to eat as well as the relatives and the objectors?</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Yes, Madam Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We will convene and start at half past one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I know that the applicant is five minutes late.  Next time, please ensure that before the Committee moves in, the applicant is already seated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> Yes Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We must try to keep to time.  If we are not going to do that, then we will not finish.</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> I apologise Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I want to simply note that we take a robust view to not commencing timeously, because of such unnecessary delays.  Let them not re-occur.</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> As the Committee pleases.</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ms Thabethe, we adjourned when you were to commence with your cross-examination of Mr Cele.</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a><span class="speaker">THULANI PERCIVAL CELE:</span> (still under oath)</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You may proceed, thank you Ms Thabethe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS THABETHE:</span> Thank you Madam Chair.  Mr Cele, with regard to the family of Amos Cele or let me be more precise, with regard to Amos Cele, are you related to him in any way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Is it correct that he is your grandfather?</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> You have also stated in your evidence earlier on that at this area, in particular, at Manyaseni, there was no political fighting, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Coming back to the incident firstly which happened on the 25th of December 1989,  you in your evidence, you indicated that you were informed that there were people in the area who had come to attack you, is that correct, would I be right in putting it this way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Exactly who had told you that these people came to attack you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> A small boy from the area, his name is Beko.</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Won't you spell that for us?  The name of the person who told you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Can you spell that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Beko.</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Buko?</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Beko.</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Beko?</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that his first name or his last name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> I only know him as Beko.</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How old was this man?</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> There seems to be  a problem with the sound with the applicant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can you hear me now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If you can just put down what you are holding on your hands, you will hear much better.   Now can you hear me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How old was Beko?</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> I am not certain as to how old he was, but he was a small boy, young boy, but we were playing soccer with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Would you say he was approximately 15 years or younger than 15?</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes, approximately 15 or younger.</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you, you may proceed Ms Thabethe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Thank you Madam Chair.  Did you ask Beko where he got this from, this information from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> When I first heard about this, I didn't believe that that was the truth, I only believed that it was the truth when I saw the people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> I will leave that question for now, even though...</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Don't leave it, won't you just for completeness sake round it up.  When were you told by Beko that certain people wanted to kill you, when was this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> On the 24th.</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And where was this, was this at your house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> At home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did he indicate who wanted to kill you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> No, he only told me that there were people who arrived and he heard that they arrived here to kill me because they wanted to pay revenge on Martin's death.</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where was Beko staying at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> At Manyaseni.</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was he staying with the Cele's?</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> No, he was staying at his home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Thank you Madam Chair, maybe I should follow up my question.  My question was did he tell you how he got to know of the fact that these people were looking for you, that was my question?  Where did he hear this from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> No, he didn't tell me and also I didn't ask him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> In your statement on paragraph 8, you say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a>"... the house belonged to Amos Cele who was an IFP member."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a>	How do you know this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> I knew that because sometimes IFP supporters would come to Amos' house.   Even IFP meetings will sometimes be held at his house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> My  instructions, Mr Cele, are that Amos Cele did not belong to any political organisation, what is your response to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> I deny that because I have full information that he was a supporter of a member of the IFP, but there was no conflict between us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Is it your evidence, am I understanding you correctly if you say the fact that he was an IFP member, was not a source of any dispute in your area, is that what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> The time I am referring at, at the time, in that area, there were no conflicts but there were conflicts in the neighbouring areas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> I will take that answer to be yes, there was no problem with the fact that you saw him as an IFP member, even though I have been instructed that he was not an IFP member.   Do you want to say anything on that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> At the time, I have never experienced any or I have never seen any conflict between him and others.</p>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> You also state in your statement that you called on  Nococanya who was staying with the deceased, Martin Ngcobo and you asked them who the people who had visited Amos Cele's house were and their response was that they didn't know who these people were, do you remember saying that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> I didn't call Nococanya, I personally.</p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I don't think that is what is being put to you, what is being put to you is that you had a discussion with Nococanya and her mother Diana, yes Diana?</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes, I did speak with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> And according to your evidence they responded that they didn't know what these people wanted.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> According to my instructions Mr Cele, apparently they told you that these people were Martin Ngcobo's relatives who had come to see Martin Ngcobo's three month old baby and who had also come to find out whether they could find the other parts that were missing in his body.  What is your response to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> No, I wasn't told about this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Did you know that Martin was staying with Nococanya?</p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes, I knew that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Did you know that they had a three month old baby?</p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Even though I didn't know the months of the baby, but I knew that they had a baby together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Did you know that the people who had come to Amos Cele's house were related to Martin Ngcobo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> No, I didn't know that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Who did you think these ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Sorry, did Dudu, the deceased come with them or was she staying at your place, in your vicinity, your area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> If you could please repeat that question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Didn't Dudu come with the people from Umlazi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes, she came with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> And you knew she was the sister of the deceased, Martin?</p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes, I know that.   But at the time when I had a conversation with Nococanya, Diana and Simon, I didn't know that the people from Umlazi came with Dudu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Thank you.   I just wanted to make a follow up of the question that I have asked, you are saying you never knew who these people were before you spoke to Nococanya, is that your evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> No, I didn't know that.  The only thing I knew is that there were people, I was told that there were people who came to pay revenge on Martin's death and that is why I asked Nococanya because I knew that Nococanya was related to Martin or was a wife or Martin.  I wanted relatives to explain if they have any idea about these people who came, but then I didn't know who they were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Mr Cele, do you know or did you know that Nococanya is Amos Cele's daughter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> So was it strange to you if these people came to Nococanya's father's house instead of coming to her house, was that strange to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Nococanya is also my relative, even though we are staying in different houses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> My question is was it strange that they came to Amos, they arrived in Amos Cele's house instead of Nococanya's house bearing in mind that Nococanya was Amos Cele's daughter?  My question is was there anything strange?</p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> I don't quite understand your question, I would like you to clarify.</p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> May I just explain.  What is being asked of you is whether you found it peculiar that the people who allegedly came from Umlazi had gone to Nococanya's place instead of going to - had gone to Amos Cele's house instead of going to Nococanya's house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes, it was strange to me that why if they came to pay revenge, they came to Amos Cele's house, not from Nococanya's house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You don't seem to be responding pointedly to the question.  You have now introduced another element, now just try and confine your answers to what is being put to you without having to elaborate because in doing so, you are also confusing your own evidence.  Was there anything strange when these persons came to Amos Cele's house and not to Nococanya's house?  Yes, if you think there was, and then you may proceed to elaborate why you thought it was strange.</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> I have never seen these people to that area, this was my first time to see these people.  Dudu was the one who usually comes to the area to visit, but the place she would visit was Nococanya's, not Amos' place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Mr Cele, I put it to you that since there were five people who had come from Umlazi, and they had come to Nococanya's home or Nococanya's father's home, there was nothing strange about that, what is your response?</p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Hasn't he just responded to that, Ms Thabethe?  He says it was strange because Dudu used to visit Nococanya and not Amos Cele, you can take it no further than that, I think.</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Thank you Madam Chair.   You have also mentioned on paragraph 9, Mr Cele, that there were people standing outside and they were shouting that they wanted Martin's hand or arm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> How many people were shouting that, can you remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> I cannot remember how many people, but there were a few people who were outside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Were they just shouting or were they shouting at you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> They were just shouting to the direction of my house and I wasn't the only one who was at my house, my other sisters were there as well.  They said a lot, but what I can remember is what they have directed to me, they asked me specific, that is what I can remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> My next question was going to be, I guess I should ask that question, how did you know that these comments that they wanted Martin's hand and arm, were directed to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> They asked me who was Thulani and I said I was Thulani and they said they are coming to fetch Martin's hand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> My instructions Mr Cele, are that there is no such incident that happened.  The only thing that happened is Dudu Ngcobo did mention the fact that they were looking for Martin's hand or arm, whilst she was standing outside Amos Cele's home which happened to be next to yours, and that is how you heard about this comment, but it was not directed to you.  What is your comment to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> I don't know about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> In your evidence you have stated that the reason why you took these people into the hill where they were sjamboked, it is because they were people who came to attack your house?  Do you remember that evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> You mean us taking them to the hill?</p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Maybe I should read what you say in paragraph 10.  You say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a>"... on the 26th of December, we waited for them, myself, Roy and my other friends.  All my friends left at 11.00 am, then these people saw an opportunity and came towards my house."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a>	My instructions are that no such incident occurred, what is your comment to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> To me it is still exactly what I have stated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think what is being asked of you is, why did you wait for them to attack you and you had to wait in the company as you have alleged at paragraph 10 of Roy Cele and your other friends on the 26th of December?  Have they given or made any suggestion that they would be attacking you, I think that is what is being asked of you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> This is after I heard that the reason they came there, they came to pay revenge on Martin's death and that is why my friends stayed with me, because they realised that I was alone and if they were to leave me alone, I was going to be easily attacked, therefore they stayed with me until late and the next morning, they decided to go back to their respective homes to bed and eat, that is when they started shouting or approaching my house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you recall that when you were giving your evidence in chief, you intimated that you became aware that these persons had come to attack you around the 24th and that is when they arrived, on the evening of the 24th?  No, I will correct myself, because as I am putting it to you, I am reading my note</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a>"... they arrived on the evening of the 24th and we discovered that or there was a rumour that they had come to launch some revenge attacks for Martin's death on the 25th of December."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a>	That was the ambit of your evidence in relation to this point.    My question is, and I need clarity from you, when you heard on the 25th about this rumour that these persons had come to launch retaliatory attacks for Martin's death, what made you believe that that attack would be launched on the 26th because your friends came to keep you company on the 26th and not on the 25th?  How did you know that the attacks were going to be launched on a particular day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> No, my friends didn't come on the 26th, I was with them all along.  On the 26th in the morning, that is when they left.  I was with them the previous night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, I note I have made an error.  You have intimated to that extent at paragraph 9 and 10.   You may proceed Ms Thabethe, that was an error on my part.</p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Thank you Madam Chair.   On paragraph 12 of your statement you say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a>"... after gathering it was decided that these people should be fetched and questioned about their presence in the area."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a>	My question to you is when you took the people who were in that house, for questioning, you also took the people belonging to this family, not only the people who had come into this house, who were outsiders, why did you do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> We didn't take very member of the family, we took the people who came to Amos' house and we also took Bonny.  The female from Amos' house, they volunteered to come, we didn't call them, they came on their own.</p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> I must say Mr Cele, I find that very strange.  You were armed, isn't it when you came to Amos Cele's house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes, we were armed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> You were a group of, a large number of people, males, isn't that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes, there were also females amongst us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> But it was predominantly males, is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line546"><a name="pos546"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Now your evidence is that you only took Bonny Cele and the other girls followed voluntarily after people who were well armed and predominantly male?  I find that very strange to comprehend.</p>
<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ms Thabethe, do you have evidence or instructions to the contrary?</p>
<p class="line" id="line548"><a name="pos548"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Yes Madam.</p>
<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If you do, won't you just put it to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> I put it to you Mr Cele that the females who were in that house, were forced out of that house into the hills for questioning, by yourselves because you were armed.  What is your comment to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> No, that is not true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What you are saying is that it was not your intention to take women, the local women, to your "People's Court", is that what you are saying, they came of their own volition?</p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> When we left and approached Mr Amos' house, we were looking for the people who were armed and that is why we surrounded his house, because we were basically looking for the people who were armed, who were at Mr Amos' house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If that is so, can you explain to this Committee why then you proceeded to impose a sentence on the people who had voluntarily come to that "People's Court", because in your evidence in chief, you yourself stated that you imposed a sentence, 50 strokes had to be administered on those women?</p>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> When we arrived there and when they were there, they were present there, when they were questioned, they were answering and they were also giving up their ideas and also, they didn't want Bunu to be part of what we were going to do there to these people who came from Umlazi.  They didn't want us to punish Bonny, they wanted us to punish only the people who came from Umlazi, but then we didn't want to punish only those people, we wanted to punish them together with Bonny because that was the reason for them to be there.  That is why we ended up punishing those females as well.   The only person who we went and fetched who was a female, was Nococanya because we wanted to question Nococanya.</p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You may proceed Ms Thabethe.  We are obviously having regard to your earlier evidence with regard to why you punished these women, we however will not belabour this proceedings by putting what you initially said in your evidence in chief, which is contrary to what you are saying now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Thank you Madam Chair.  Earlier on in your evidence, you had stated that when you took these people up in the hill for questioning, you questioned them on their political affiliation, do you remember saying that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Why did you do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> As I have already explained that we already suspected because of the way they came to the area, and the people whom they came to their house, or the relatives they came to them, denied and the person whom was closer to them, was Bonny, who was running away because he was involved in other incidents.</p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How did you know that Bonny was closer to these people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> One could see because they were with Bonny.  They were one group and in those days, it was easy to identify because people belonging to an ANC organisation, will be together all the time, and IFP will be together, and people will easily know if you are an ANC or IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, but these persons were coming there for the first time, is that not so, that is your evidence?  You only knew Dudu out of the whole lot, you did not know the others, so how would you have known that they are a close association with Bonny?  Just by that encounter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> No, I am not referring to the group who just came to that area for the first time.  I am talking about the Senora's, the people who used to go to people's houses and ... (tape ends) ... but people from the community, they knew who they were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But Ms Thabethe is not questioning you about any other persons other than the ones that you thought came from Umlazi and were there to kill you, those are the person which you are being questioned about and only those persons.  How did you know that those persons had a close association with Bonny?  That is your earlier evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line566"><a name="pos566"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> They were together with Bonny on that day, even on the day when they came to my house, they were with Bonny.</p>
<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Proceed, Ms Thabethe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line568"><a name="pos568"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Sorry, could I interrupt something.  Beauty, she was the fiancee of Martin, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line570"><a name="pos570"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Was she an IFP member?  Beauty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> No, I don't have any idea about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Do you know whether Martin was an IFP member?</p>
<p class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> No, he just came to the area, I didn't know him very well at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> What as the trouble between you and Martin?</p>
<p class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> There was no trouble or any problem between me and Martin.</p>
<p class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Wasn't there trouble about money?</p>
<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> There was a long time ago, before his death and in fact, on his death, it was already been resolved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> What was this trouble about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> He had my money, I am not sure whether he lost it or he just didn't want to give me back my money.  Then there was a problem and I decided to go and approach Nococanya and explained to her about the money and I was paid this money, but it wasn't Martin, it was Diana who paid me back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> So Martin refused to pay you the money back that he owed you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> No, he didn't refuse.</p>
<p class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Well, Diana paid it to you, not Martin?</p>
<p class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes, Diana paid it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> How did Martin get hold of this money of yours?</p>
<p class="line" id="line585"><a name="pos585"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Martin took my bag, it was on a Friday.  He took it like he was playing.  It is a bag, not a bag where you put money, the one which we used to put money was inside that bag, that big bag.</p>
<p class="line" id="line586"><a name="pos586"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> So you and Martin knew each other for a long time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> No, not a long time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line588"><a name="pos588"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Well, at least - when was this money taken, you have known him since then or did you know him before that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line589"><a name="pos589"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> I have known him before he took my bag.</p>
<p class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> That was almost a year before or six months before he was killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> What are you referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> When he took the money, it was more than, it was 11 months before he had been killed, he took this money roundabout February, wasn't it, January?</p>
<p class="line" id="line593"><a name="pos593"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes, we can say that even though I am not sure, but it is the same year, it was in 1989.</p>
<p class="line" id="line594"><a name="pos594"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> So you have known him at least for at least 11 months, but maybe even a year earlier, maybe two years almost?</p>
<p class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> When the incident of the money occurred, he just came to the area.   When he arrived at the area, we were there, we were the first people he came to know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line596"><a name="pos596"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Yes, right.  Okay, now I just want to put it to you that you have known him for at least a year before he died.</p>
<p class="line" id="line597"><a name="pos597"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes, I can agree with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line598"><a name="pos598"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> And I have asked you whether he was an IFP member, he stayed in that area of yours for at least a year?</p>
<p class="line" id="line599"><a name="pos599"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line600"><a name="pos600"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> So do you know whether he was an IFP member or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line601"><a name="pos601"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> No, I don't have any idea when it comes to his political affiliation, I never actually paid attention on his affiliation, because he would come to the area and then leave and then come.</p>
<p class="line" id="line602"><a name="pos602"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Dudu stayed in the area, was she an IFP member?</p>
<p class="line" id="line603"><a name="pos603"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Dudu never stayed in the area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line604"><a name="pos604"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Beauty, his fiancee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line605"><a name="pos605"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> I never used to see Dudu in any political meetings whether IFP or ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line606"><a name="pos606"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> I am not talking about Dudu, I am talking about Martin's fiancee who had this child with him, his girlfriend, Martin's girlfriend.</p>
<p class="line" id="line607"><a name="pos607"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes, I am referring.</p>
<p class="line" id="line608"><a name="pos608"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Her name was Beauty, isn't that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line609"><a name="pos609"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line610"><a name="pos610"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Now was she an IFP member?</p>
<p class="line" id="line611"><a name="pos611"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> No, I didn't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line612"><a name="pos612"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Didn't you tell us that in your area the people of the two parties were flocking together, they visited each other and you knew, it was obvious to which party you would belong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line613"><a name="pos613"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line614"><a name="pos614"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> And to which party, with whom did she associated, with the IFP's or the ANC's?</p>
<p class="line" id="line615"><a name="pos615"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> As I have already explained that we will know how a person or what political organisation a person belonged, by associating with other people who were in that organisation, but with Beauty, she was working outside the area and sometimes she would stay wherever she is working and come back weekends and she never associated with people from any political organisation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line616"><a name="pos616"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> And Martin's death had nothing to do with politics as far as you know, there was no rumour that he was killed because he belonged to a certain political party?</p>
<p class="line" id="line617"><a name="pos617"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> No, I didn't hear any rumour.</p>
<p class="line" id="line618"><a name="pos618"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> And these people coming from Umlazi, they didn't accuse you or the ANC that you had killed Martin because he was a political opponent?</p>
<p class="line" id="line619"><a name="pos619"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> All I know is that they accused me of his death and as to what reason they had in order to accuse me of Martin's death, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line620"><a name="pos620"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Now the deceased in this case, Dudu, the woman that you had killed with the stone, throwing the stone at her head, there is no dispute now, we are talking about her now, did she belong to the IFP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line621"><a name="pos621"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> At the time, I didn't have full information about her political affiliation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line622"><a name="pos622"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> So why did you kill her, it was no political reasons then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line623"><a name="pos623"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> The reason she was killed is because she brought the people who came from Umlazi to the area to actually point at me or us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line624"><a name="pos624"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> So the only reason why you killed her was because she came with the people from Umlazi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line625"><a name="pos625"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> The aim was to kill all of them, the only reason she was the only one killed, is because she couldn't run faster, but the aim was to kill all of them.  It was so unfortunate that she couldn't run faster than the others, because the decision was taken that the reason they came, they came because they wanted to kill.</p>
<p class="line" id="line626"><a name="pos626"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Who did they want to kill, you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line627"><a name="pos627"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line628"><a name="pos628"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> And for what reason did they want to kill you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line629"><a name="pos629"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> I don't know, I think they can explain this much better than me, what I did ask them is that why they came from Umlazi to my area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line630"><a name="pos630"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Yes, and what did they say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line631"><a name="pos631"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> They said Amos and Nococanya came and told them that they knew the person who had Martin's hand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line632"><a name="pos632"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Sorry for interrupting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line633"><a name="pos633"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry Ms Thabethe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line634"><a name="pos634"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Thank you Madam Chair.  Mr Cele, you gave evidence and you have just given evidence again that the family of Martin Ngcobo was told by Nococanya and Amos Cele that they could get their hand from you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line635"><a name="pos635"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line636"><a name="pos636"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> My instructions, Mr Cele, are that this is not true.  Further, my instructions are that it is true that Kanyo or Beauty and Amos Cele went to Umlazi looking for Martin Ngcobo because he had been missing for two days or more and they went to Umlazi to look for him and they did not find him and they came back to Inanda.  It is not true that they had told the family of Martin Ngcobo that the arm and the leg could be found at Inanda, because at that stage when they went to Umlazi, they did not know that Martin Ngcobo had died.  Do you have any comment on what I have just said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line637"><a name="pos637"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> I do not have any information whether what they are saying is true or not, but I was told by those people who came from Umlazi that Amos and Nococanya came and told them that they could find Martin's hand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line638"><a name="pos638"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Where and when did they tell you this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line639"><a name="pos639"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> When we were questioning them at the meeting, when we were questioning them about why they came and how they came.</p>
<p class="line" id="line640"><a name="pos640"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> My instructions with regard to the questioning in the hills are that the question you asked as who told them that you had killed Martin Ngcobo, that is the question you asked them and not all the other questions that you have stated that you asked.  What is your comment to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line641"><a name="pos641"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Who said so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line642"><a name="pos642"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> It is my instructions Mr Cele, can you answer the question.  Did you ask who they had got it from that you had killed Martin Ngcobo at the hill, or didn't you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line643"><a name="pos643"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The people that you questioned during the "People's Court" proceedings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line644"><a name="pos644"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> No, that is not true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line645"><a name="pos645"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> You also stated in your evidence that at the hill you found arms from the people you were questioning.  Do you remember that evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line646"><a name="pos646"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes, I do remember that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line647"><a name="pos647"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> From whom did you get these arms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line648"><a name="pos648"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> One came from Bonny, the other one came from Ernest and the third one from one, a very light in complexion guy who had a perm in his head, I don't remember his name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line649"><a name="pos649"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Whereabouts in their bodies did you get these firearms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line650"><a name="pos650"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> The one I took from Bonny, he had hidden it here as he is pointing, in front of his pants.</p>
<p class="line" id="line651"><a name="pos651"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Do you remember in your evidence you said that you asked Ernest Ngcobo whether he belonged to the ANC or IFP and he said he belonged to the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line652"><a name="pos652"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes, I do remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line653"><a name="pos653"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> My question to you is why was he beaten if he belonged to the ANC, you also belonged to the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line654"><a name="pos654"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> My problem was that they were attacking and we realised that he was just saying that because they were attacking and he realised that we caught them and we asked them simple questions which one will know if one is an ANC member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line655"><a name="pos655"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Where had they attacked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line656"><a name="pos656"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Who?</p>
<p class="line" id="line657"><a name="pos657"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Ernest Ngcobo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line658"><a name="pos658"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> They came to attack there, to attack me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line659"><a name="pos659"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If you did not believe anything that Ernest Ngcobo said about his political affiliations, what was the import of even putting the question to any of them, knowing that they will say anything to save their skin?  What purpose were you seeking to serve in having to put questions of political affiliation to people that you knew, they will say anything?</p>
<p class="line" id="line660"><a name="pos660"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> I never took a decision on my own, we took decisions as a group.  If the group decided that we were going to do this, that is what we will go.  The organisation and the community decided that we should take them to the "People's Court" and ask them questions so that we found out whether the people came really to attack or they just came because of the vacation or the December vacation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line661"><a name="pos661"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You as the leader of the structure at Manyaseni, did you not have any kind of influence with regard to the mood and how things were being conducted by the group on that particular day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line662"><a name="pos662"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes, as a leader, I will say something, but to a certain extent like for instance, I did say that the females shouldn't be sjamboked like the males, because they didn't do so much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line663"><a name="pos663"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What do you mean by saying the females shouldn't be sjamboked equally like males, because they hadn't done much?  What have they done if there was anything at all that they had done?  Had they done anything?</p>
<p class="line" id="line664"><a name="pos664"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> They were not respecting the group, even the way they were talking to the group, they were not respecting the group.  I think that is the reason why the group ended up sjamboking them.  Because in that area, even drinking alcohol as a female or swearing at someone, or going out with two men, was a crime in that area.  As a female, you do not talk to males, the way they talked to this group and this is why the group decided that they should be sjamboked.  That is why I had to ask for them to be sjamboked less than the males.</p>
<p class="line" id="line665"><a name="pos665"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Let me get clarity without belabouring this point, the reason why you took a decision to punish the women was because of their behaviour during the questioning of the people who were from outside Manyaseni?  Would I be correct in summarising your evidence in that fashion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line666"><a name="pos666"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line667"><a name="pos667"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In that case, it had nothing to do with politics?</p>
<p class="line" id="line668"><a name="pos668"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> I personally perceived this as a political act because if they didn't behave the way they did, they were not going to be sjamboked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line669"><a name="pos669"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, you are talking now about women, the reason why you punished them was because of their moral behaviour, because women are supposed to behave in a particular fashion and they didn't conform to the expected behaviour of women, it wasn't because of their political activism?</p>
<p class="line" id="line670"><a name="pos670"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes, but the people who were involved, more especially the decision makers, decided that females shouldn't behave the way they did.  They way they were speaking to the group, the group decided that it was unacceptable for them, for the females to speak to them that way, so they decided that they were a problem.</p>
<p class="line" id="line671"><a name="pos671"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Let's not dilly-dally on this point, it is a very simple issue.  The punishment you meted out on those women, was because of their behaviour, not because of the fact that they had done anything politically to you?  It was not because of their political activities, but it was because of their behaviour during your questioning of the people who were coming from Umlazi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line672"><a name="pos672"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line673"><a name="pos673"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Proceed Ms Thabethe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line674"><a name="pos674"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Thank you Madam Chair, coming to the attack on Dudu Ngcobo, my instructions are that when you came down to look for Dudu Ngcobo, you with other people, went into the house of Amos Cele and you only found Zodwa Cele in the house.  What is your comment to that, your response to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line675"><a name="pos675"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> I did not quite get that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line676"><a name="pos676"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> When you went into the house, there was only Zodwa Cele in the house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line677"><a name="pos677"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> When we were looking for Dudu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line678"><a name="pos678"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line679"><a name="pos679"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> I cannot remember correctly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line680"><a name="pos680"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Further that you questioned her about the whereabouts of Dudu and you also pressed a bushknife and you assaulted her, what is your response to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line681"><a name="pos681"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> I have no knowledge thereof.  What I do remember is that the only reason we went to fetch her is because she was the only person absent.</p>
<p class="line" id="line682"><a name="pos682"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Maybe I have confused you, I am not talking about the incident where you went to fetch Dudu from the house and you took her up to the mountain, I am not talking about that incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line683"><a name="pos683"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think you have not been clear yourself, Ms Thabethe, when you put questions.  The first question that you put to him, won't you just make it quite clear that you are now talking about the incident after Dudu had been sjamboked and had been allowed to leave and that he thereafter, later after having allowed her to leave, went inside, that he, himself, went inside the house looking for Dudu and only found Zodwa Cele in the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line684"><a name="pos684"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> I am indebted to you Madam Chair.  That is the question, I don't know whether you want me to repeat it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line685"><a name="pos685"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You understood how it was rephrased that question, after you had administered the 200 lashes on Dudu Ngcobo and had allowed her to go back and had instructed her to leave the area, you later went inside Amos Cele's house whereat you found a lady by the name of Zodwa Cele.  You then questioned Zodwa Cele and asked about the whereabouts of Dudu Ngcobo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line686"><a name="pos686"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> That is not correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line687"><a name="pos687"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And that you further assaulted her in the process of questioning her about the whereabouts of Dudu Ngcobo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line688"><a name="pos688"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> That is not correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line689"><a name="pos689"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Proceed Ms Thabethe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line690"><a name="pos690"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Thank you Madam Chair.  Further my instructions Mr Cele, are that you proceeded to run after Dudu and you not only killed her, you not only beat her or stoned her, but you also used bushknives to kill her.  What is your response to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line691"><a name="pos691"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you mean he used a bushknife?</p>
<p class="line" id="line692"><a name="pos692"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Yes, Madam Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line693"><a name="pos693"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> No, that did not take place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line694"><a name="pos694"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Are you saying it never happened or are you saying you never bushed her, but she was bushed by somebody else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line695"><a name="pos695"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you saying the evidence will show that Mr Cele stabbed Dudu Ngcobo with a bushknife, that is the evidence you will lead?</p>
<p class="line" id="line696"><a name="pos696"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Yes, Madam Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line697"><a name="pos697"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> That I stabbed her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line698"><a name="pos698"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, using a bushknife?</p>
<p class="line" id="line699"><a name="pos699"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> No, never used a bushknife, nobody used a bushknife.</p>
<p class="line" id="line700"><a name="pos700"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> My other question to you Mr Cele is exactly on what grounds was a decision to kill Dudu Ngcobo, reached?</p>
<p class="line" id="line701"><a name="pos701"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> The decision was not taken merely specifically about Dudu, but with regards to everyone who had come.</p>
<p class="line" id="line702"><a name="pos702"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Won't you come again for my sake, Ms Thabethe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line703"><a name="pos703"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> On what grounds was a decision reached to kill Dudu Ngcobo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line704"><a name="pos704"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Sorry Ms Thabethe, but was the evidence not that they were counselled by this group of people, the comrades, who arrived in the kombi, not simply to lash people because they would be able to mobilise and take revenge, and that they should be killed?  Wasn't that his evidence?  And that they acted upon that counsel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line705"><a name="pos705"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> That was the evidence Member of the Committee, but what I am asking is what were the grounds for reaching such a decision?</p>
<p class="line" id="line706"><a name="pos706"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Maybe you want to rephrase your question because as it stands, it is going to elicit the same kind of evidence which has already been adduced before this Committee that the reason why they killed Ms Dudu Ngcobo was because of the advice given by the groups of comrades from Amadiqwe.  If you put your question in that way, that is the evidence that we will get, which evidence we already have, unless obviously you want to find out why.</p>
<p class="line" id="line707"><a name="pos707"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> I am indebted to you Members of the Committee, maybe I should go back a bit on my instructions.  Mr Cele, let me start here with regard to the people of Amadiqwe, my instructions are that the people of Amadiqwe were fetched by one of your people to come into your area, what is your comment to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line708"><a name="pos708"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you say the people, are you still referring to the same people that we know from the evidence led before us, as comrades?</p>
<p class="line" id="line709"><a name="pos709"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Yes, Madam Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line710"><a name="pos710"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Maybe we should stick to the word comrades, so that we don't get confused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line711"><a name="pos711"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Thank you Madam Chair, I will repeat my question.   According to my instruction, the comrades who eventually advised you to kill Dudu Ngcobo, were actually fetched by one of your people, I am just looking for his name here, Madam Chair, if you could bear with me,  by Qwazi, who is your half-brother.</p>
<p class="line" id="line712"><a name="pos712"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> I would deny that because when all of this occurred Qwazi was with me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line713"><a name="pos713"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> My instructions further are that Qwazi went to fetch the comrades from Amadiqwe, using taxi's, and he was actually seen coming back with the comrades in two taxi's and they also had containers filled with petrol.  Do you have any comment on that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line714"><a name="pos714"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> That is not correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line715"><a name="pos715"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> My next question is, when you met the comrades according to your evidence, you met the comrades, isn't it, after you had given lashes to the victims, exactly what did you tell the comrades about what had taken place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line716"><a name="pos716"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> I told them everything that had happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line717"><a name="pos717"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> The fact that you were suspected of killing Martin and the fact that you had taken the people from Amos Cele's house to question them about that, would I be correct to say that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line718"><a name="pos718"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> What they wanted to know was the purpose of these persons' presence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line719"><a name="pos719"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Yes, what I am asking you is, did you tell them it is because they suspected you of killing Martin Ngcobo and as a result, you decided to question them and lashes were given out or lashes were, they were beaten?  Is that what you explained to the comrades?</p>
<p class="line" id="line720"><a name="pos720"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Through you Chairperson, ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line721"><a name="pos721"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> And then after explaining this, they said no, these people should be killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line722"><a name="pos722"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Ms Thabethe, just a second, you are losing us because the Interpreter started to give the answer after your first question, when what came to us is what they wanted to know and then you kept on talking, so I would appreciate it if you would follow the interpretation in order to allow us to follow what is going on.  May I get back to the original question there where Ms Thabethe interrupted the answers through not listening to the interpretation.  You were asked whether you told these comrades everything about the suspicion that these people had, that you killed Martin, the questioning around  what followed after the accusation of you being involved in Martin's death?  Did you tell all of this to the comrades?</p>
<p class="line" id="line723"><a name="pos723"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line724"><a name="pos724"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Then you started to say what they wanted to know, what did the comrades then want to know from you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line725"><a name="pos725"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> They wanted to know what decisions were taken with regards to these people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line726"><a name="pos726"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Sorry for interrupting now, but didn't you tell them when you told them that they came there, they called on you for Martin's arm, they were suspicious that you were responsible for Martin's death, that you questioned the people about their political affiliation, didn't you tell them about having sjamboked them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line727"><a name="pos727"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> I did inform them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line728"><a name="pos728"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So why did they ask again about the decision?</p>
<p class="line" id="line729"><a name="pos729"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> They questioned me, they asked me as we were talking, as we were discussing and they were not satisfied with the decision or with the steps that were taken against these people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line730"><a name="pos730"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> What was their interest and why could they be satisfied or not satisfied if they were not from your area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line731"><a name="pos731"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> They had just come because we were all comrades.  At that time there was co-operation and we used to assist one another in whatever way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line732"><a name="pos732"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> No please, didn't you tell us earlier that at the time of this incident, there was no co-operation yet?  That was your evidence and you said specifically that came later.</p>
<p class="line" id="line733"><a name="pos733"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> Through you Chairperson,  in the evidence in chief, it was made clear by the applicant that the co-operation had already started before the incidents in Manyaseni area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line734"><a name="pos734"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line735"><a name="pos735"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> My apology, I will check my notes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line736"><a name="pos736"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I recall that.  I am a little disturbed by your response to questions being put to you from the bench.  I had earlier on understood the gist of your evidence in relation to the comrades from Amadiqwe to have been that they knew already about what was happening by the time they came to that place?  I recall this because I think I questioned you on this and because I was questioning you, I was not taking notes.  But this is what I seem to recall having asked you how they knew about this whole incident and you said you don't know how they knew, somebody must have told them, but by the time they reached where you were, they already were abreast with the situation.  I am now a little troubled by your now recent evidence which seems to suggest that they were actually brought up to speed by the information that you furnished to them.  Do you get my problem?</p>
<p class="line" id="line737"><a name="pos737"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line738"><a name="pos738"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now can you comment on the problem I have?</p>
<p class="line" id="line739"><a name="pos739"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> As I explained before, I did not know who had fetched them or how they came to this area but the moment that they arrived, it became clear that they did have knowledge of what was going on, but they wanted to know from us just what was going on at the time and what we were doing about it.  That was when they disapproved of our decision to just sjambok and let these people go, because they felt that it was wrong that they had come from so far a place to attack us and then we just let them go.</p>
<p class="line" id="line740"><a name="pos740"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, Ms Thabethe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line741"><a name="pos741"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Thank you Madam Chair.  With regard to the killing of Amos Cele ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line742"><a name="pos742"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Before you leave, are you leaving this point because if you are, I would like to interpose again, just put one question of clarity which actually is a follow up from what the Member of my Committee has put to you.  What exact authority was enjoyed by the comrades of Amadiqwe on the activities of your structure?</p>
<p class="line" id="line743"><a name="pos743"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> They did not have any authority, but as comrades involved in different areas, we were at different levels.  Some people were more experienced than others.</p>
<p class="line" id="line744"><a name="pos744"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was it usual for your structure to not just give advice, but to give overriding decisions in other structures outside your area?  Like would you have come with the same decision on issues affecting the comrades at Amadiqwe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line745"><a name="pos745"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> It could have been possible, the usual policy was that if there were problems in an area, there would be persons or comrades from other areas who would be requested to come and assist depending on how serious the matter was.  When they arrived, they already knew that there were people who had come to attack the area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line746"><a name="pos746"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Ms Thabethe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line747"><a name="pos747"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Thank you Madam Chair. ... (tape ends) ...   MR CELE:   I only learnt of it later.</p>
<p class="line" id="line748"><a name="pos748"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Is it correct that he was petrol bombed or petrol was sprayed on top of his body and he was burnt?</p>
<p class="line" id="line749"><a name="pos749"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you asking him to give a hearsay evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line750"><a name="pos750"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> I will withdraw the question then, Madam Chair.   My last question to you Mr Cele is ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line751"><a name="pos751"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I think you may phrase that question in a different way, did anyone tell you how Amos Cele was killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line752"><a name="pos752"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> I only heard that he was dead, but with regards to how he was killed, nobody explained to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line753"><a name="pos753"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And you never asked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line754"><a name="pos754"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> At that time, there was no specific person that I could have asked because I heard about it when I arrived home in the evening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line755"><a name="pos755"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I understood or I understand that Amos Cele was your grandfather?</p>
<p class="line" id="line756"><a name="pos756"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line757"><a name="pos757"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Your grandfather dies and you don't ask how he came to his death?</p>
<p class="line" id="line758"><a name="pos758"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> He did not reside at the area at the time of his death, his house had already been burnt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line759"><a name="pos759"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> When was he killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line760"><a name="pos760"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> On the 28th.</p>
<p class="line" id="line761"><a name="pos761"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> On the 28th, three days later?</p>
<p class="line" id="line762"><a name="pos762"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes, I think so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line763"><a name="pos763"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line764"><a name="pos764"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Thank you Madam Chair, I think something arose out of the applicant's evidence that I would like to follow up.  You have stated that he wasn't staying at his house any more because his house was burnt down.  My instructions are that there was one house, there was one hut that remained and actually Amos Cele stayed in that house and when he was killed, he was taken out of that hut.  Would you know anything about this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line765"><a name="pos765"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> No, I do not have any knowledge thereof.</p>
<p class="line" id="line766"><a name="pos766"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Would you dispute this that when the house was burnt, not all the huts were burnt, there was one hut ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line767"><a name="pos767"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Ms Thabethe, we really can't follow because you are not following the interpretation and we don't get the answers.  You follow up and the Interpreter is not interpreting to us, please if you will follow the interpretation too.</p>
<p class="line" id="line768"><a name="pos768"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> I apologise Honourable member of the Committee.  Where would you like me to begin?</p>
<p class="line" id="line769"><a name="pos769"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> The question was put to you that the instructions are that Amos stayed in the one house in the kraal that was not burnt, he was taken out of that house and killed.  The question was put, would you dispute that, we haven't heard your answer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line770"><a name="pos770"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> I do not have any knowledge thereof.  All that I know is that the house was burnt and nobody remained there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line771"><a name="pos771"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I understood you earlier to say that your house was next to Amos' house, the place where you lived?</p>
<p class="line" id="line772"><a name="pos772"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line773"><a name="pos773"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> In the same kraal, the same area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line774"><a name="pos774"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> It is not the same kraal, but opposite.</p>
<p class="line" id="line775"><a name="pos775"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But you did not see him in his kraal, for the next three days, you never saw him again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line776"><a name="pos776"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> No, I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line777"><a name="pos777"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line778"><a name="pos778"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> My last question to you Mr Cele is, was it necessary to kill Dudu Ngcobo and Amos Cele?</p>
<p class="line" id="line779"><a name="pos779"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I think he already on Amos said that he did not believe that he should have been killed, that it was wrong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line780"><a name="pos780"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> I will rephrase my question then, was it necessary to kill Dudu Ngcobo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line781"><a name="pos781"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> On that day or ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line782"><a name="pos782"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ms Thabethe, shouldn't you rephrase that question so as to assist this Committee to reach a just and equitable decision, having regard to the requirements of the Act which speaks to one having to determine whether an act is an act associated with a political objective, pertinently, whether any political objective was achieved or what political objective would have been achieved through the killing of Dudu Ngcobo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line783"><a name="pos783"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> I will try Madam Chair.  Mr Cele, in your evidence you have given that Dudu Ngcobo was killed because the comrades had given an order that she be killed.  My question to you is, why was it necessary or was it necessary, to kill Dudu Ngcobo in your opinion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line784"><a name="pos784"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line785"><a name="pos785"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line786"><a name="pos786"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Because she had been with the people who had come to attack, the decision to kill them, did not limit itself to Dudu, but to everybody else who had been in the area to attack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line787"><a name="pos787"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> What was political about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line788"><a name="pos788"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Our intention was to eliminate or to drive away the people who had come to attack our area, such that they would be unable to return and do the same thing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line789"><a name="pos789"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> And by killing Dudu Ngcobo, did you achieve this objective?</p>
<p class="line" id="line790"><a name="pos790"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Please repeat that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line791"><a name="pos791"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> By killing Dudu Ngcobo, did you achieve that objective?</p>
<p class="line" id="line792"><a name="pos792"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> At that time, I did not know whether these people had come in collusion or under her intentions, but all I can say is that the plan to kill her, was not limited just to Dudu, but to everybody else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line793"><a name="pos793"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Thank you Madam Chair, no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line794"><a name="pos794"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS THABETHE</p>
<p class="line" id="line795"><a name="pos795"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Ms Thabethe.  Mr Molohlanye, do you have any re-examination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line796"><a name="pos796"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> Yes Chairperson, I have only one question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line797"><a name="pos797"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, you may do your re-examination.</p>
<p class="line" id="line798"><a name="pos798"></a><span class="speaker">RE-EXAMINATION BY MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> You said comrades from Amadiqwe came to your area, is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line799"><a name="pos799"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line800"><a name="pos800"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> Amadiqwe, is that a neighbouring area or is it a place far from Manyaseni?</p>
<p class="line" id="line801"><a name="pos801"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> It is a neighbouring area, I can walk from Manyaseni to Amadiqwe on foot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line802"><a name="pos802"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Actually, when he was giving his evidence in chief, he estimated that it would be a distance of from here to Durban station, unfortunately we are not familiar with this place ourselves, and we would need to get an approximation.  Can Ms Thabethe and yourself assist this Committee by estimating how far that is?</p>
<p class="line" id="line803"><a name="pos803"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Approximately four kilometres.</p>
<p class="line" id="line804"><a name="pos804"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> May I just follow up on this, asking how long would it take you to walk from where you lived, to Amadiqwe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line805"><a name="pos805"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> I cannot be certain, but if I were to walk casually, it would take me about 45 minutes to an hour.</p>
<p class="line" id="line806"><a name="pos806"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line807"><a name="pos807"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> So, Amadiqwe was not very far from Manyaseni as you made us to understand, it was one of the surrounding areas around your area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line808"><a name="pos808"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes, it was one of the neighbouring areas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line809"><a name="pos809"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> In your examination in chief, you mentioned that there were already fights between the IFP and ANC members in the surrounding areas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line810"><a name="pos810"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But not in Manyaseni?</p>
<p class="line" id="line811"><a name="pos811"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes, there were political killings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line812"><a name="pos812"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Molohlanye, I hope you bear in mind his evidence because it was quite crystal clear that there was no political conflict at Manyaseni which is his area, but that there were some political conflicts in the other neighbouring areas, but not at Manyaseni which is where this incident took place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line813"><a name="pos813"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> Yes Chairperson.  What I wanted to know from the applicant is whether in Amadiqwe, were there any such political uprisings, that means fights between IFP and the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line814"><a name="pos814"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What bearing it has in relation to the offences for which he is seeking amnesty, I fail to understand, but I will allow the re-examination.</p>
<p class="line" id="line815"><a name="pos815"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> Please answer the question Mr Cele.</p>
<p class="line" id="line816"><a name="pos816"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> The relationship between these two organisations in neighbouring areas, was very poor, to such an extent that one group would be driven out of the area.  With regards to Amadiqwe, the IFP was driven out and they all left to live at Mzyasafi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line817"><a name="pos817"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> Thank you Chairperson, no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line818"><a name="pos818"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MOLOHLANYE</p>
<p class="line" id="line819"><a name="pos819"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Mr Malan, do you have any questions to put to Mr Cele?</p>
<p class="line" id="line820"><a name="pos820"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Please Chair.  I just want to have clarity on this, earlier in your - I am not sure whether it was under cross-examination - you said that you were told that Amos and Nococanya told the people that they could find the hand and arm with you.  Is my note correct, the hand or arm, that you had it?  In other words the inference that I draw is that you were told that Amos and Nococanya informed them that you killed Martin?  Is that correct, were you so informed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line821"><a name="pos821"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It was in cross-examination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line822"><a name="pos822"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line823"><a name="pos823"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> If Amos was indeed party to accusing you, why would it have been wrong to kill Amos?  Shouldn't he then also have been killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line824"><a name="pos824"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> I was asked, I was asked when Dudu was killed, did I see it or was it correct for Amos to be killed as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line825"><a name="pos825"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Yes, I think you said no, it was wrong for Amos to be killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line826"><a name="pos826"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line827"><a name="pos827"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But yet Amos accused you of having killed Martin?  Wasn't that your evidence in cross-examination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line828"><a name="pos828"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> At that time, when we questioned them, we started with Diana and Nococanya and they denied knowledge of these people.  When that information came that Amos and Nococanya had allegedly told these people that they could find this with me, it then became very unclear as to what was going on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line829"><a name="pos829"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> If I may just put a few questions to summarise for my own understanding, your evidence is that you have no knowledge of Martin or Nococanya having been members of the IFP, you have no such knowledge?</p>
<p class="line" id="line830"><a name="pos830"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> That is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line831"><a name="pos831"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> As far as you were concerned, they were not of the opposition group?  They were not the enemy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line832"><a name="pos832"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Whose enemy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line833"><a name="pos833"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> The ANC's enemy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line834"><a name="pos834"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> I did not know anything with regards to Nococanya.</p>
<p class="line" id="line835"><a name="pos835"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Then the second piece of information is that you were told that this group which Dudu brought, Dudu was Martin's sister, and according to you Dudu shouted asking you for Martin's arm, that this group wanted to attack you?  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line836"><a name="pos836"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> I did not say that Dudu shouted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line837"><a name="pos837"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Well, sorry, but the group came and the group shouted to you that they wanted the arm.  The information was that this group came to revenge Martin's death and accusing you, wanting to attack and kill you, that was your information, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line838"><a name="pos838"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes, when they asked who was Thulani and I showed myself, the person who then directed himself to me said he was coming to fetch Martin's hand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line839"><a name="pos839"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Yes.  But there was no indication that this was a reprisal from the IFP on ANC, politics at that stage, did not enter the question?  It was simply a group led by Martin's sister, brought there by Martin's sister, that you say wanted revenge for Martin's death and accusing you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line840"><a name="pos840"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> At that time, I regarded it as a political matter because if they had really come with regards to Martin's issue, they would have been at Nococanya's place, but they were instead at a house which I knew to belong to people who were IFP members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line841"><a name="pos841"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> These IFP members, was that Amos?  You say Amos was an IFP member?</p>
<p class="line" id="line842"><a name="pos842"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line843"><a name="pos843"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And he was your grandfather?</p>
<p class="line" id="line844"><a name="pos844"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes, he was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line845"><a name="pos845"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And he lived in the same area where Nococanya lived?</p>
<p class="line" id="line846"><a name="pos846"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes, but not the same kraal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line847"><a name="pos847"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Yes.   But it was quiet, there was no conflict, so he had no conflict agenda, Amos was not looking for fights with the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line848"><a name="pos848"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> At that time, before this incident, there was no violence in the area.  Although there was such violence in neighbouring areas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line849"><a name="pos849"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But in that area there was no political conflict?</p>
<p class="line" id="line850"><a name="pos850"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> At the time, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line851"><a name="pos851"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> This group of five, the marshals of which you were elected leader, that group also constituted the Court, the tribunal?  You were also the tribunal, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line852"><a name="pos852"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> I was not a marshall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line853"><a name="pos853"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But you patrolled, this group of five that you told us about of which you were the leader, you were patrolling the area and you were responsible for the safety of the people and to keep the criminals at bay, you had the "People's Court" up the hills and you were, this Court, this tribunal, you referred to it as a tribunal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line854"><a name="pos854"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line855"><a name="pos855"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Was that Court or tribunal Chaired by yourself as the leader of this group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line856"><a name="pos856"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line857"><a name="pos857"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Who was the Chairperson of this tribunal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line858"><a name="pos858"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> The Chairperson was elected at that particular time.   Anybody who was present, would Chair such a tribunal, but after all the discussions, it was the committee, the structure that made a decision.</p>
<p class="line" id="line859"><a name="pos859"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What you are basically saying is that the tribunal which has been alluded to by my colleague and which you have testified to as having been a "People's Court", would be Chaired by different people on different occasions, there wasn't a standing committee which would be responsible for conducting proceedings?  This is how I understood the "People's Court" to be operating myself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line860"><a name="pos860"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line861"><a name="pos861"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, but that you belonged to a structure to which you were a leader, you were a leader, of which you were a leader?</p>
<p class="line" id="line862"><a name="pos862"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line863"><a name="pos863"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> That is where I am still confused, because I understood you to be taking these people up the hills to the place where you said you usually conducted the "People's Court"?  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line864"><a name="pos864"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line865"><a name="pos865"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Also at this place, you put certain questions to these people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line866"><a name="pos866"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line867"><a name="pos867"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Who else put questions to these people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line868"><a name="pos868"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> There were many people who asked questions, I would just like to explain, on the day of this incident, this was the first occurrence, it was unlike any other meeting we had had before.   As they were being asked questions, some people were even impatient with the process of questioning them, because people were not sure whether these were IFP or Senora's who had come to commence their activities again.  There were many questions that were put to them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line869"><a name="pos869"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Who decided the punishment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line870"><a name="pos870"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> It was the structure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line871"><a name="pos871"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> That structure, is that structure the structure that you were the leader of?</p>
<p class="line" id="line872"><a name="pos872"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line873"><a name="pos873"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> May I on a point of clarity, when you say the structure, are you talking about the "People's Court" or are you talking about something else as having been responsible for taking a decision of what kind of punishment to meet out to the people who appeared before you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line874"><a name="pos874"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> I am referring to the people who made the decision, that is the group who would step aside after all the questions had been asked and they would make a decision on what punishment should be meted out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line875"><a name="pos875"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Would that be the structure of which you were the leader?</p>
<p class="line" id="line876"><a name="pos876"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line877"><a name="pos877"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You see, that is really what I understood you to have been saying to us, broadly people were asking questions, but the tribunal, the people making the decision, was the same structure that you were the leader of?</p>
<p class="line" id="line878"><a name="pos878"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line879"><a name="pos879"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Your evidence is that for some reason, and I am still not sure why, you believed that this was an IFP group who came with some political motive against the ANC, for some reason you were convinced that this was not really merely a reprisal from Martin's sister and his friends or relatives, based on their suspicion that you killed Martin?</p>
<p class="line" id="line880"><a name="pos880"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line881"><a name="pos881"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Can you tell me why you are satisfied that it was not some kind of mission of Martin's relatives and friends to firstly get the true facts about Martin's death and if getting it, to avenge his death?</p>
<p class="line" id="line882"><a name="pos882"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> The reason that I was not convinced is that Martin was not born and bred in that area, his only connection to the area was through Nococanya and when we questioned Nococanya and her family, they denied knowledge of this people and we also realised that these people were not even staying with Nococanya, they were staying at another home.  Another factor is that Martin had been buried for quite a while, and these people only came at that time.  If they had been, indeed been concerned with Martin's death, they could have come earlier than that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line883"><a name="pos883"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Why did they then come?  Why did they ask about Martin's arm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line884"><a name="pos884"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> I do not know.  As far as I am concerned, they had just come to launch an attack and they used Martin's death as an excuse, because they had already been caught, we had caught them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line885"><a name="pos885"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Sorry, and the attack, just to get the picture clear, this attack is now mounted by seven people of which one is Dudu, a woman, coming to an area where there is basically no political support to support them in such an attack.  Seven people come to attack you within a whole community, or attacking the community, apparently not you?  Let me withdraw that question, let me try and ask it differently.  Did you believe that they wanted to attack the community or attack you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line886"><a name="pos886"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> I believed that they were out to attack me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line887"><a name="pos887"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Then, just lastly, why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line888"><a name="pos888"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> I thought that they had their own personal agenda's.  I am certain they also knew that I was an ANC member, who was a leader.</p>
<p class="line" id="line889"><a name="pos889"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But who has never been involved in any violence at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line890"><a name="pos890"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> There was no violence in my area, only in the neighbouring areas.   When people from other areas came maybe to seek assistance from my area, they would approach me.  It was obvious that I was the leader.</p>
<p class="line" id="line891"><a name="pos891"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line892"><a name="pos892"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Adv De Jager, do you have any questions to put to Mr Cele?</p>
<p class="line" id="line893"><a name="pos893"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> No questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line894"><a name="pos894"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Cele, to your knowledge, to which political organisation did Bonny belong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line895"><a name="pos895"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> As far as I know, I usually saw him with AmaSenora.</p>
<p class="line" id="line896"><a name="pos896"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is AmaSenora, did they belong to any publicly known political organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line897"><a name="pos897"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> They were affiliated to the IFP, but AmaSenora were a criminal gang.</p>
<p class="line" id="line898"><a name="pos898"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now, who in Amos Cele's house, was an IFP member?</p>
<p class="line" id="line899"><a name="pos899"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Amos.</p>
<p class="line" id="line900"><a name="pos900"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was he occupying any particular office?</p>
<p class="line" id="line901"><a name="pos901"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> I do not know, but I would see him in the company of high ranking Officials in the IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line902"><a name="pos902"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you say high ranking Officials within the IFP, what are you referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line903"><a name="pos903"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> I am referring to people who were leaders in the area, IFP leaders just as I was an ANC leader in the community, that is how I knew them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line904"><a name="pos904"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He was associating with the leadership, the local leadership of the IFP in the area?  Is that what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line905"><a name="pos905"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line906"><a name="pos906"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who was the Chairperson of the IFP in the area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line907"><a name="pos907"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> I did not know exactly who held what position, but I knew that they were in leadership positions because sometimes other IFP leaders from surrounding areas would come and they would approach them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line908"><a name="pos908"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you aware of Martin's death when it happened?  Martin Ngcobo's death?</p>
<p class="line" id="line909"><a name="pos909"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> No, I only heard about it when I returned from work, that he had been killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line910"><a name="pos910"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When did you first become aware of his death?</p>
<p class="line" id="line911"><a name="pos911"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> I first became aware on the day when his body was discovered, that is when I returned from work, on that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line912"><a name="pos912"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Approximately how many days or weeks before the visit by Dudu Ngcobo and her companions?  A week, two weeks?</p>
<p class="line" id="line913"><a name="pos913"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> It could have been two to three weeks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line914"><a name="pos914"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you aware at any given state before the visit by Dudu Ngcobo and her companions of Martin Ngcobo's funeral having taken place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line915"><a name="pos915"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> I knew that the funeral had taken place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line916"><a name="pos916"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How did you know that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line917"><a name="pos917"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> The people from Nococanya's home are my relatives.</p>
<p class="line" id="line918"><a name="pos918"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  Thank you.  Mr Molohlanye, I've got to make sure that - Mr Molohlanye, emanating from the questions from the bench, do you have any re-examination that you intend doing on your witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line919"><a name="pos919"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> No questions Madam Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line920"><a name="pos920"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MOLOHLANYE</p>
<p class="line" id="line921"><a name="pos921"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That being so, is that the applicant's case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line922"><a name="pos922"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> Yes Your Worship.</p>
<p class="line" id="line923"><a name="pos923"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you intend to call any further witnesses in support of this applicant's application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line924"><a name="pos924"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> Yes, I would like to call only one person who in connection with the death of Amos Cele.</p>
<p class="line" id="line925"><a name="pos925"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That is an applicant.  I am talking about this applicant, in support of Mr Thulani Cele's application, do you intend to call any witnesses to support his application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line926"><a name="pos926"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line927"><a name="pos927"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Cele, you are hereby excused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line928"><a name="pos928"></a><span class="speaker">ADV DE JAGER:</span> Can you just tell us, you are applying for amnesty in respect of, is it only the murder of Dudu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line929"><a name="pos929"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> No, Honourable member, I am applying for amnesty for the public violence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line930"><a name="pos930"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The way I understand the issues that you are applying for are two acts, that is the public violence as well as the killing of Dudu Ngcobo.  Those are the only two acts for which Mr Thulani Cele seeks amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line931"><a name="pos931"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOLOHLANYE:</span> Yes, those are the two grounds because on other ones, the death of Martin and Amos Cele, he still holds it as I said that he was not involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line932"><a name="pos932"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> (Microphone not on)  You are applying in respect of two acts, not grounds.  Mr Cele, we have already excused you, you may step down, unless of course there is something that you wish to say which your Counsel has omitted to give an indication to us that you would like to say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line933"><a name="pos933"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> I just wanted to explain that I seek amnesty for the murder of Dudu as well as public violence.  But I would also request the Committee to look into the other matters because I am also serving a sentence with regards to them, although I was not part of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line934"><a name="pos934"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Cele, prior to the commencement of these proceedings, we held discussions with both our Evidence Leader, Ms Thabethe and your lawyer, Mr Molohlanye because we were perturbed that your amnesty application was only with regard to the two acts that have again been confirmed by your lawyer to be based on.  We are assured by Mr Molohlanye that the position has been (indistinct) explained to you, what the effect of the amnesty is and what the requirements thereof are.  We were assured further that you understood that if you do not apply for amnesty as you have done because you deny guilt in respect of the killing of both Martin Ngcobo and Mr Amos Cele,  that this Committee would then not have any jurisdiction at all to hear any of those acts for which you are not seeking amnesty.  We were assured by Mr Molohlanye that this had been explained to you and that you comprehended the situation quite well.  We were particularly concerned because we knew that at the time of applying for amnesty, you were not legally represented and we wanted to make sure that this was brought to your knowledge even before we commenced proceedings to hear your application.  As you have been undoubtedly informed by Mr Molohlanye, this is not a Court of Appeal, this is a very extraordinary and unique process where we only hear offenders who are admitting to having committed offences for which they seek amnesty and for which they allege that there was political motivation and which of course at the end of the day, we must be satisfied that indeed those offences were politically related.  Your request that this Committee should do something in respect of the offences for which you were convicted and sentenced involving the killing of Mr Martin Ngcobo and Amos Cele, you must be aware sir that we are in no position to do anything about that.  We had hoped that that position had been made crystal clear by Mr Molohlanye.</p>
<p class="line" id="line935"><a name="pos935"></a><span class="speaker">MR CELE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line936"><a name="pos936"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line937"><a name="pos937"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line938"><a name="pos938"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ms Thabethe, I don't know what your direction will be to this Committee.  We would propose that we proceed to hear evidence of the second applicant in respect of the killing of Amos Cele before you can lead your witnesses in respect of both applicants.  I think that will expedite matters better, than if we were to give you an opportunity now to lead the evidence of the objectors in respect of the offences for which Mr Thulani Cele seeks amnesty.  Are you in agreement with that procedure?</p>
<p class="line" id="line939"><a name="pos939"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Yes Madam Chair.</p>
