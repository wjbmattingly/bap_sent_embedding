I then went to Ndanda, myself and Israel as I appear here with not disguise.  That is why when I called him, on turning to face us he recognised me and he tried to draw his gun.  After that we then went back to J2 where I resided.  And because we had just completed a successful operation we then decided to go via Dlamini to check if he was not home and we also carried out an attack there.  \n\tXena has already explained that he shot twice using a shotgun.  He was shooting upwards knowing that nobody was going to hurt with these two shots, so that Sergeant Dlamini should answer and that would indicate to us as to his presence and we were hoping that he would shoot back but he instead insulted us.
