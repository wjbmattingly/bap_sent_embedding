            "I was raised in a conservative home.   We were a religious family and we believed in the triune God.  From a very early age onwards I attended political meetings with my father.  And as a result of that, my objectives became the following - I believed also that these objectives were very important to me.  I believed in the triune God, in the preservation and continued existence of the Afrikaans language and  culture, self-determination and the continued existence of the Boer people in its own territory.  The promotion of an independent Christian freedom at all costs.\nI worked in Potgietersrus, I worked in Potgietersrus on the mines as an artisan on the mines and that is where I saw what was happening in our country politically speaking.  I saw that things were changing in the sense that things were affecting the Boer people.  I then went to an AWB meeting in Potgietersrus, I listened to what was said and I listened to the objectives of the AWB.  And I approved of these objectives because I realised that these people were actually fighting the Afrikaner cause.  I also became a member of the CP at the time.\nI then left Potgietersrus, I moved to Richards Bay.  When I arrived there, there was no branch of the AWB at the time.  One day when I came home from work I saw some AWB posters announcing an AWB meeting to be held and I went to the particular meeting.  Mr Eugene Terreblanche was present at the meeting and he led the meeting.  \nAfter the meeting a request was made that people that wanted to join the AWB had to stay behind, and I did that because I wanted to join the AWB, and that's where I met Mr Botha.  After the meeting I visited Mr Botha on a number of occasions.\nWe drove to Eugene Terreblanche's home and the Wenkommando was established at one such meeting, and Mr Botha was elected as the Kommandant for Richards Bay.  Mr Botha appointed me as a Field-cornet in Richards Bay.  In due course Mr Botha contacted me.  I went to him, and he told me that he had been approached by the Orde Boerevolk.  He showed me the oath form.  I read it and I agreed with all the principles set out in the form.  At that stage I could not take the oath because a witness was not present.  I went home, and after quite a while, on the evening or on the day of the 9th of October 1990, at about six o'clock in the evening, Mr Botha contacted me and asked me come to his home, and I did so.\nWhen I arrived there, Mr Botha and Mr Marais were present at his home.  Mr Botha informed me of the attack which had taken place in Durban, in which approximately 30 PAC members had been involved.  They had entered a shop and stolen knives and attacked White people on the beach front.  We then decided that we would act against these attackers.  We then left for Durban that same evening.  \n\tWe drove to Durban and planned to attack a taxi.  We did find a taxi and started following it, but the taxi turned off from the freeway and we then decided to abort that particular attack.  We decided that it was late at night and that we should rather return home, and then we decided to go to a petrol station to buy some cooldrink before returning home.  Whilst we were drinking our cooldrinks a bus drove past and we decided that we would launch the attack at the bus.  We followed the bus and when we overtook the bus, Mr Botha gave the order to fire.  We fired at the bus.  We drove past the bus and made a U-turn and came back.",
