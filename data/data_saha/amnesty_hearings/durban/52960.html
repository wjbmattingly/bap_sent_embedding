<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, this is a similar application by Mr Wasserman.  Unfortunately you would have to refer to two bundles in order to find the complete part of his application, relevant to the present application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a>	That is the Zandile bundle 1 at page 112 to, well it runs on to page 125.  Thank you Mr Chairman, I appreciate that.  No, it is further than that,  it starts at page 112 Mr Chairman and it runs on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a>	The second - oh, I am sorry, 135, I heard 125, sorry Mr Chairman my Attorney says 125, I misheard.  I heard 135.  Mr Chairman, the other bundle is the Bhila bundle, at page 28.  Sorry page 44, it is the typed page 28.  It has been a long day Mr Chairman, page 44 and following.  The witness is ready to take the oath Mr Chairman</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In English or Afrikaans?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> English.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">LAWRIE WASSERMAN:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR VISSER:</span> Are you ready Mr Wasserman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Wasserman, you are applying for amnesty for the abduction, detention and the elimination of Mr Bhila and for all acts, omissions or offences associated with that incident, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You request the Amnesty Committee to also incorporate into your evidence also, the written submissions by the Foundation for Equality before the Law, the submission by Gen Johan van der Merwe to the TRC and the written statements by the Generals to which Mr Rosslee has already referred the Committee to, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> The same applies to some of the evidence, to the evidence which Mr Vlok and Mr Van der Merwe, Gen Van der Merwe presented to the Amnesty Committee in the COSATU House and Khotso House and Cry Freedom incidents, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Would you please Mr Wasserman, inform the, or fill in the Committee about your personal particulars?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I was born in Northern Rhodesia, later Zambia in October 1955.  At the age of 12, I moved to the then Southern Rhodesia, which is now Zimbabwe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> To Bulawayo, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> To Bulawayo in Southern Rhodesia, which is now Zimbabwe.  I completed my schooling there in 1974.  We were all politically conservative and supporters of the Rhodesian Front, the Ian Smith political party.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a>	I grew up in a conservative environment.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Your political background, you stated in the Zandile bundle at page 113, very briefly.  Would you care to elaborate to the Committee on your ranks?  Perhaps first of all I must ask you this, is it correct that you joined the BSA, the British South African Police, in Zimbabwe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And you went through the ranks there until you reached the rank of Warrant Officer if I remember correctly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> The equivalent thereof.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And thereafter you came to South Africa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> When was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> In March 1981.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> March 1981.  And did you then join the South African Police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> With what rank?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Detective Sergeant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And you are still today employed, I am sorry, are you still today employed in the service of the South African Police Service?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No Mr Chairman, I left officially on the 31st of May of 1998.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> 1998, this year?  With what rank?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Detective Warrant Officer, Inspector.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Inspector, Detective Warrant Officer, all right.  What were your experiences after leaving school against this police background and starting with the time that you served in the SAP for those six years before you came to South Africa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a>	Can you just sketch to the Committee the background to give them an understanding of what you were exposed to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I did basic training in the then Salisbury Police Depot.  I started off Uniform Branch enquiries, based in the districts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a>	After a period of two years, I applied to the Criminal Investigation Department of the SAP.  Shortly after that, there was a massive increase in war effort from the then ZANA and ZIPPER Forces of the Patriotic Front.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a>	From then I was pretty well relieved of routine police duties, and went into counter-insurgency pretty well full time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Full time in counter-insurgency operations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> In counter-insurgency operations, that is right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> All right, yes, continue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I attained the rank of Detective Section Officer, which is the equivalent of the Warrant Officer rank.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And during that period of police service in Rhodesia, what type of experiences did you have in a period where you suggested that you, or that you stated that you dealt with counter-insurgency operations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, I was involved in many armed contacts.   I hit a good couple of landmines myself and my Unit, ran sources and agents within those two liberation movements that I mentioned, ZIPPER and ZANA.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did these experiences make any impression on your own mind?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, it made an impression Mr Chairman, obviously there was a lot of fighting, a lot of blood, a lot of killing, and one hardened somewhat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  On the 6th of March 1981, you emigrated to South Africa, and you joined the South African Police with the rank of Sergeant, you have already told us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> In 1982, in February, were you then transferred to the Security Branch in Durban until your retirement on the 31st of May 1998?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> At which state you were declared medically unfit, due to post traumatic stress syndrome, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Are you, yourself, receiving treatment for your condition?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> During your service in Durban, you served under Colonel, the late Colonel Andy Taylor as I understand it, for most of the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What Section was he the Head of?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> He was Head of the Terrorist Section.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And how many divisions were there in that Terrorist Section?</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It was basically divided into two Sections.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Two Sections?</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> At a later stage, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Which were they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Terrorist Investigation and MK Terrorist Intelligence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Intelligence?  So you had an Investigation side and an Intelligence side?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Is it my understanding that Colonel Taylor, Major Taylor at the time, was the Head of both of those legs of the Terrorist Section?</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Who was the Head of the Investigation leg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It was also Colonel Taylor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Also Colonel Taylor?  Who was the Head of the other leg, the Intelligence leg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Colonel Botha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Colonel Botha, who will also give evidence in the present proceedings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Who was your Divisional Commander of the Security Branch during 1987?</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> 1987?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Colonel Steyn.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, that would be one of the applicants, I am sorry, I think it is J.S. Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> J.A.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> J.A.  J.A. Steyn.  You sketched briefly through your Attorney the time when you filed your application for amnesty, your political background.  Just before I come to that, perhaps we should go on with this, in your application form, that would be the Zandile bundle, at page 121 to page 124, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And do you confirm that those were the basic political, that was the basic political background against which you require the Amnesty Committee to look at your amnesty application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Would you like to extend a little on that, go a bit further and tell the Committee of how your mindframe was after you had come to the Republic of South Africa and how your political views were forged.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, after arriving in South Africa, I realised that the revolutionary onslaught was on at this side of the Limpopo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a>	It was very similar, or it was about to gain in similarities to that which I had experienced in Rhodesia.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a>	I also came to realise that there was not that much difference between the ideologies of the three liberation movements including the South African one, and the ANC.  On joining the South African Security Branch, I had reason to study the ideologies and the groupings relevant to the South African struggle and familiarise myself with it and particularly familiarise myself with the increase in Umkhonto weSizwe activities, military activities of that organisation and its recruiting increased of its military activities inside and outside South Africa and the increase of its underground activities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a>	I also studied many of the events which built up the terror campaign and familiarised myself with threats of a communist invasion, which was, which I anticipated would start happening inside South Africa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you find yourself in sympathy with those learnings, with the theories and did you take those seriously to heart, yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I did indeed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  Just continue.  We are talking about matters which had an effect upon you.  Yes, continue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> The amount of MK activities in Natal and the expose of MK's activities in Natal in the form of bomb attacks, assassinations on SAP members and personnel and people that were not sympathetic to the ANC, and members of the SAP had a profound effect on me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a>	Some colleagues were killed and injured and their homes destroyed, whilst they were performing duties.  They were targeted as legitimate targets by the liberation forces and that effected me merely because they represented or was seen to be upholding what was the government of the day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Which was in fact so, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, continue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Myself and my colleagues in the Durban Branch, we were also aware that we were targets ourselves and these factors did ensure that we had to do anything we could to contain and normalise the situation in this province.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you visit scenes of maiming, scenes after explosions where people had been murdered, or injured yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I did Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Give us some experiences which you had.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Well, I attended all the major bombs in Durban, in the Durban central area.  I had gunfights myself in which there were killings and woundings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a>	I attended houses of members and councillors who had been bombed.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What did such experiences have on you personally?</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It made me determined to oppose these attackers and stop them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  Please continue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I realised that as policemen the major primary role is to protect the public from destruction, devastation and killing and the situation here was particularly difficult to do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a>	Many people in this province discriminated against us because we were not always able to achieve and to keep things normal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What was the situation with investigating crime and taking people to court in regard to politically orientated violence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> If that was principally almost the first intention, however, if we succeeded and one could get prosecution through the court, that would be a great sense of accomplishment.  However, the situation did get out of hand, and this became the exception rather than the rule Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What were the problems in taking matters to court if there were any?</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> The major problem was that due to the amount of intimidation,  violent reaction witnesses and intimidation of the public, they would not assist and lack of witnesses was the principle problem.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.   As far as you were concerned, would you agree with the proposition that has been made by many members of the Security Branch, that what you were expected to do was really to fight an undeclared war?</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you consider the circumstances in and around the Durban area to be a war situation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It definitely was Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What do you ascribed that to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, the amount of military activity which is now a matter of record I believe before this Commission, indicate in itself the amount of military activity conducted by the MK forces.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  Mr Wasserman, with leave of the Committee and in order not to fall into repetition, we will not go into the detail of it now, but we will deal with it when Mr Botha gives his evidence, you know what his evidence is going to be, it has been discussed with you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a>	Can you now say that you agree with his references to the violence which took place within this area during the period that you were here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Is that a legitimate question Mr Visser, I mean he doesn't know yet what will be said?  There may be an intention, but it has not been said, but we get the drift of what you want to achieve.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I did that with a tongue in my cheek.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Then you may proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> But Mr Chairman, in fact I shouldn't even have put the question, because it just occurred to me just now that at the end of this witness' evidence, I am going to suggest that he does not give evidence about the other incidents and that we deal only with the Bhila incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a>	He is going to be back any way, and he can then confirm it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Perhaps that question can just be struck off the record.  You were faced with a faceless enemy we heard the evidence of Mr Rosslee, about workers at day and combatants by night?  I think the Committee has heard so often about the problems which the Security Branch members had, that I don't think it is necessary to drive these points into the ground and perhaps we can continue, going on to something else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a>	But the fact of the matter is this, is it not, that instead of just merely exercising pure police duties, you were called upon as members of the Security Branch, to uphold political party's views and policies?</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And as such, became more and more embroiled in a political struggle, rather than taking people to court and investigating cases as normal policemen would be expected to do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Was it your experience also that your colleagues as well as yourself, were called upon to do duty as we know it, border duty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And that there were problems with adapting as Mr Rosslee put it when you returned to Civvy Street, to the country?</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you, yourself, find a difficulty in that adaption?</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Through all of this, Mr Wasserman, and I am leading a little bit Mr Chairman, for the sake of going a bit quicker, is it true that you experienced certain pressures?</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Where did those pressures come from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> The pressures came from the government, from - we were expected to get hold of the problem and normalise the situation.  We were placed under increasing pressure to get results and normalise the situation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  There were also security systems in place, were there pressures exerted from that direction as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> There were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr Visser, will you not allow us just to pursue these last two questions, three questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a>	The response of prejudice firstly was that you experienced on yourself, pressures from government.  In which way, who in government put pressure on you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Perhaps that is not the correct words, but from within my Branch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Well, exactly, could we really stick to your really, not jargon or rhetoric, but your personal experience.  Within the Branch there was pressure?</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> There was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Your senior officers expected performance from you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Then secondly  you responded also to the call upon, you were called upon as Security Branch to uphold a political party's views and policies.  That was the question, and you confirmed it?  Will you explain to me what do you have in mind there, which political party or were you simply expected to implement the law as expected by the government of the time, and do that under a command structure?  Or is it really, are you referring to a political party?</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> When was that question put forward?</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Just before the one that I raised first.  You were called upon as Security Branch to uphold a political party's views and policies, that was the question, and you confirmed it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a>	I am putting that question again.  Was there ever expected of you to uphold a political party's views and policies?</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Okay, thank you, you may proceed Mr Visser.</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Who was the government of the day in 1987 Mr Wasserman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> The National Party, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> The National Party, was that a political party within this country?</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Indeed it was Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did it have its own policies?</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, it did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Including the policy of apartheid?</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Were you - was it expected from you to uphold the laws as promulgated by that government?</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It was Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Let's go on to the assassination of Mr Bhila.  Can you just tell the Committee exactly what you remember about this incident?  Perhaps before I get there, perhaps before I get there, looking at your application form, at page 44 of the Bhila volume, bundle 1, no particulars had been given to you, by you in that application form, except that you referred to the incident under paragraph 9(a)(i) as being the elimination of ANC/MK member, Sipho Stanley Bika, which you rectified at page 45 as under the heading name of victim, Sipho Stanley Bhila.</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And what you said under (iv) was the nature and particulars of this incident are not immediately recalled to mind.  I would do the necessary research, etc, in an attempt to provide a full and detailed statement which will be provided at a later stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a>	What I want to ask you to tell the Committee is this, was there such an occasion where you had the occasion of making a full and detailed statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> At the time of completing this particular one that we are talking about here, there was no time at my Attorneys.</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> All right, if you want to deal with that first, when you signed this affidavit, your application form, did you have a one on one consultation with your Attorney at the time, in December 1996?</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And at that time, how long before the cut off date was it that you consulted with your Attorney?</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I believe it was two days.</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Two days?  And Mr Wasserman, it is no secret, you apply for some 15 incidents?  How many?</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I think it is 15.</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> 15 incidents, and at the time when you couldn't remember this, the idea was to get in the application form at all costs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And then later, to fill in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.   Now, what I am referring to now is were you later - did you later receive a notification from the Investigation, apparently my Attorney doesn't agree with me Mr Chairman, just bear with me.  Oh yes, no that is correct, it wasn't a subpoena, it was an informal request made to you and others of Durban, who served in the Security Branch at the time, to meet with the Investigation Unit of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And you spent some two days dealing with all the issues which were raised by them and you allowed yourself to be questioned by them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Inter alia, did you also deal with the Bhila incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> So, having said that Mr Wasserman, and you having now had opportunity of recalling the events of the 22nd of February 1987, will you please tell the Committee what you remember about the incident concerning Mr Bhila?</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes Mr Chairman.  On the day in question, I was instructed by Colonel Taylor, to follow him in my vehicle to the Railway Police range.</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> How did this instruction reach you, can you remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Via my radio.</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> On your radio?</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> On my police radio, yes Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I am sorry, but let's just take this step by step.  Colonel Taylor or the then Major Taylor then asked you to meet him where?</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Follow?</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> To follow him where?</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> To the Railway shooting range at Winkelspruit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> All right, and did anything happen along the road?</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> We pulled off before the range and I, and we spoke together and he informed me that the Vlakplaas contingent had picked up Mr Bhila.</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a>	He was at the range.</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> The pistol shooting range?</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is the pistol shooting range, that is correct Mr Chairman.  He further informed me that Mr Bhila was going to be eliminated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you say to him, well, why tell me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, the reason for that was clear to me as I also regarded Mr Bhila as a very dangerous Umkhonto weSizwe trained person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> On that point, Mr Wasserman, we have received from my learned friend Mr Prior, Exhibit D, I believe it is D Mr Chairman, may I just check, the extract from the charge sheet, D, an extract from the charge sheet.  In the Ramlakan case, which is just a cross-reference to Exhibit A and I am afraid Mr Chairman, I know you haven't received yours yet, we will really make serious attempts at making sure that you have yours tomorrow, at page 13 to an incident at the Port Natal Administration Board Offices at Lamontville relating to an SPM limpet mine, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a>	I beg your pardon, my Exhibit D seems to have disappeared, I must have mislaid it here somewhere.   Be that as it may, it speaks for itself Mr Chairman.  Is that part of the reason that, yes, I have just found it Mr Chairman, did you - what did you know about Mr Bhila, his background?  Did you know that he had received training for example?</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman, I knew he had been trained, he had been military trained internally.</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, and the charge sheet suggested in paragraph 4 of Exhibit D that he suggested the bomb to be planted at Lamontville township offices on the 16th of June 1985?</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That is an important day, June the 16th, for the African National Congress, is that not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> It is a day in which an important event is being remembered?</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What about DLB's and Mr Bhila, can you fill the Committee in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Bhila was responsible for the maintenance and distribution of weapon DLB's.</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, we will hear more about that when Mr Botha gives his evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a>	Were those issues you believed to be relevant to Mr Bhila?</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> As far as Mr Bhila is concerned, and as far as your information was concerned at the time, did he act in concert with others, in a unit or a cell?</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, he did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Can you tell us who the other member or members of that unit might have been?</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, there were many amongst whom was Pumeso Nxiweni and Rosondo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And Rosondo, yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> And many of the arrested people which has been referred to here, as the Ramlakaners, (indistinct) personnel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Least one gets the impression from your evidence so far that there were one or two or three MK activists who were planting bombs and limpet mines and explosives, etc, in the Durban area in 1987, can you just in a sentence tell us what the situation was?  How prolific the membership was of people who had caused that kind of violent incidents?</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Well, the people that we are referring to here, were part of the first internal APMC establishment by Umkhonto weSizwe inside South Africa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And they conducted their operations under a code name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> The code name was Operation Butterfly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Operation Butterfly?  And it was due to the penetration of this Security Branch into Operation Butterfly and that is part of history now, and we know, that led to the Ramlakan case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct Mr Chairman, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> On the 24th and 25th of December 1986, approximately 30 of the cell members in Operation Butterfly were arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And we know that those were the ones - that was the group from which the accused in the Ramlakan case came?</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When were they arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> 24th and 25th of December 1986 Mr Chairman.  There was a swoop and approximately 30 of them were arrested.  Not to say that others of the same group weren't arrested later, but that was the big swoop.</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And they were the accused in the Ramlakan case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> From that group, not all of them were accused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Judgement was given on the 18th of February 1987 with the State case closed on that day.  I think there must be some mistake about dates.</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I am not mistaken about December, I might be mistaken about the year Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> If I may assist Mr Chairman, I think it was 1985.</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> One year out Mr Chairman.  I think it is on record now, that Mr Bhila and Pumeso Nxiweni were inter alia two of the accused in the Ramlakan case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> We will deal with the incidents which are laid at the door of Operation Butterfly and or its members, in the evidence of Mr Botha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a>	Coming back to your participation, you have just told us that you agreed with the viewpoint of Taylor that Bhila had to be eliminated, or did you say that he was a dangerous terrorist?  I am not sure what you said.  You agreed with Mr Taylor on what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> The reason was clear to me why Mr Taylor had said that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you agree with the thought that he had to be eliminated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I did Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And you made common cause therewith?</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I did Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What time of the day as best you can recollect, was it that you met Taylor on the way to Winkelspruit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> The best of my recollection is half past three, four o'clock, just after four in the afternoon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  And would that be also more or less the time when you together with Taylor, each in your own vehicle, arrived at the pistol shooting range?</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.   What did you find when you arrived there at the pistol shooting range?</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I found the people from Vlakplaas there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Who were they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr McCarter, Mr Rosslee, Mr Bosch, Mr Bhila.</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you know him well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Bhila?</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> All right, so he is there.  Who else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I believe that was all that was there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> All right, black members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> We had Warrant Officer Lembede from Durban.</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Michael Lembede?</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Michael Lembede, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, anyone else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> While you were there, did you see any interrogation of Mr Bhila?</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> There was no interrogation going on on Mr Bhila.</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you not interrogate him at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Not at all Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Would there have been any reason for you to interrogate Mr Bhila?</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> There is no reason for me at all to have anything to say to Mr Bhila, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Would you have known at the time, or did you know at the time, the whereabouts of Mr Pumeso?</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I did Mr Chairman, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> It has been pointed out that this incident took place within three days after Mr Bhila was discharged from the Ramlakan case.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I am sorry Mr Visser, could you just tell us you say that at that stage you were aware of the whereabouts of Mr Nxiweni?</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Where was he at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Allan Taylor Resident, Medical School.</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> He was at the Res?</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> It was suggested that the police and that would include you, killed Mr Bhila in order to exert the police's own special justice, because it might have been thought that the Court was wrong in releasing him.  What do you say to that proposition and that there was no other reason really why he was killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, that is an incorrect reason Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What perspective would you place thereon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, Mr Bhila had already shown his readiness and preparedness to use limpet mines and distribute weaponry to other personalities.  I had little doubt that he would continue with such actions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Sorry, may I just ask was he not charged for exactly those type of offences?</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, he was Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> If the question was do you think the Court made a mistake to release him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Are you asking my personal opinion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Or to acquit him?  Yes, the question was that there was a suggestion that it was the police's own justice because the Court acquitted him on such counts and then you come back and you say, no, but he had already proved that he had the mines, that he was distributing weapons, wasn't that part of the charge sheet?  That is really the question, or do you know what he was charged for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Not one hundred percent, I don't recall exactly what he was charged for, I wasn't the docket carrier.</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You knew everything about him, but you weren't involved in the preparation of the case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, I was aware he was to be charged for a bombing of Lamontville offices and for handling weaponry and distribution thereof, but the fact that he was acquitted by the Court, I accepted that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Why do you accept that he had to be killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Because the Court was the one forum that he would have continued with his actions, he was a committed combatant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You thought he was, but you had not been able to prove it, had  you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, I personally had not been able to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The police had not been able to prove it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Not during the court case, no Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> The only point Mr Chairman, least there is any confusion, is that I was really trying to clarify that there is no suggestion of criticism on the Court for having found, discharged him.  If there was evidence, of court the Court was correct in doing so.  This is the only point I am trying to make, but the reason why Bhila had to be killed in the estimation of this witness, that is another matter.  That is the next question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a>	I am trying to deal with that issue now, and he has answered Mr Chairman, and that is that he considered that Bhila, they knew that he had done these things, whatever the Court found, they knew he had done this from their information and he was, they knew also that he would continue with his activities, so that answer has also been given Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a>	You, I think we have reached the point where you are at the pistol shooting range, you are there.  As far as you can recall, he wasn't interrogated by anyone else, certainly not by you because you wouldn't have anything to interrogate Bhila about, and did you then later on that evening, accompany the Husky kombi which was referred to in evidence here, away from the pistol shooting range?</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Were you in that car or did you follow with your own car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I was in that vehicle Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well, just take us from there and take us through the facts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, the following personnel got into that vehicle, it was myself, McCarter, Rosslee, Bosch, Mr Bhila and Lembede.</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Lembede, and where were you on your way to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> We were headed off to a spot that Mr Lembede was familiar with, which is in the Umbumbulu area somewhere, at a place that I  am not able to get back to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Sorry, I didn't hear the last, you dropped your voice and I couldn't hear you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It is a place in the Umbumbulu area, it is a spot that I am not able to get back to Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, while you are on that point, we discussed last evening, did we not, the request that came through Mr Ngubane acting for the family of Mr Bhila, as to the possibility of discovering where that spot is?</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Perhaps you could just tell the Committee what you told me on the probabilities of you finding it again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> The probabilities of finding it, are not good Mr Chairman.  It was my first time to go there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Have you been there since?</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I have not Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You travelled there in the dark, that is common cause?</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you travel with a straight road until you got to this particular cliff?</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Not at all Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What was the position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> We left the tarred road, turned - I am not sure if we turned after Umbumbulu area or somewhere else, we turned to the right and thereafter, we turned many times, and I am unable to state where we were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, but if there is any assistance that you can give at all, you are quite happy and willing to give such assistance?</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I will, indeed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  All right, you are on your way to the spot which you say you probably won't be able to find again, and what, did anything occur along the road, along the way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> We had a puncture along the way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, and then eventually, did you come to this particular spot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Eventually, the vehicle was stopped at that particular spot, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Tell us what you can remember about what transpired there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> At that spot, Mr Bhila was taken out of the vehicle and taken a walk to the edge.  He was seated down.  He was blindfolded.</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> When was this blindfold placed in position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> The blindfold was placed I think, at the rifle range.</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> At the rifle range already?</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Right.  Was he also cuffed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> By his feet or by his hands?</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Wristcuffs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Wristcuffs.  All right, and what happened then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> He was then sitting down and Mr McCarter had one shot, shot him once.</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Shot him once, where on his body did he shoot him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> In the head.</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> In the head.  What happened to Mr Bhila after the shot had been fired?</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> He lay down, was straightened out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> All right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Flattened out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And what happened then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Then Mr Rosslee shot him in the head.</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Can you recall today clearly how many times?</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, not specifically, but I recall another two shots, I think, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Another two shots?</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Two shots went off.</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> In total?</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> In total.</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> One and perhaps another one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> One, and perhaps another, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So, two by Rosslee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Two by Rosslee?  Do you remember anything else that might have occurred while Mr Rosslee fired his shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Definitely Mr Chairman, he had problems with the feeding of the firearm he was making use of.  He was cocking it, obviously to clear the stoppage that had happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You know, when you and Mr Rosslee refer to cocking it, one gets the impression of cocking it with your thumb, bringing back the firing arm, is that what you mean?</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, that is incorrect, that is not the impression.</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What are you talking about when you say cocking it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Pulling the slide right back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Wracking it in other words?</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Wracking, it depends what shooting club you (indistinct).</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, I suppose so, all right.  You remember observing that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, I did, I did Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> If Rosslee had fired seven shots, would you have remembered that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I very definitely would have remembered that, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, all right.  There was a suggestion made particularly by Bosch and reference thereto also made by Rosslee in his Exhibit B and in his amnesty application, to a certain Spyker Mhieza also having been present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a>	First of all, or perhaps I should roll the two into one, did you see Spyker Mhieza there, either at the pistol shooting range or at the scene of the assassination on that particular day in question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, Mhieza was not there on that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> He wasn't, you can state that positively?</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I can state that (indistinct).</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> After Mr Bhila had been shot, what happened then, I mean to Mr Bhila?</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Lembede and Mr McCarter then bent over the body, I presume they were taking off the handcuffs and he was then pushed over the side of the cliff Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  Was it quite dark?</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It was very dark Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Were you however able to make out outlines, silhouettes of bodies?</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> How far from the scene were you at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I was standing from here to perhaps Mr Wilson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Justice Wilson, about five, six paces?</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And were you able to observe what was going on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> To a very large extend, I could.</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, all right.  Mr Wasserman, we know that thereafter you left.  Did you go back to Durban?</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I went back to the rifle range first and then on to Durban, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What happened, well, you say the rifle range, do you mean the pistol shooting range?</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What happened there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I then reported to Mr Taylor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Was he still there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> He was there, he was waiting there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, and you told him what had happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I told him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you left your car there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I had indeed, yes sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Were there any other people waiting with Major Taylor at the range at that time when you returned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> There was another vehicle there Mr Chairman, I think that was Warrant Officer Lembede's vehicle.  I don't recall anyone else, there might have been another personality with him, but I couldn't name such a person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Why would Taylor have stayed behind and wait for you there, all by himself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I can't answer that.  I think he would have waited to check on that vehicle that was also left at the range.  My vehicle as well as Mr Lembede's.</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Can you tell me why all of you had to go along for the execution, I think you said yourself McCarter, Rosslee, Bosch and Lembede went with for the execution of Bhila, why all of you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Well, Mr Taylor informed me that I must accompany Lembede, he would take us to a  place where the job could be done.  My exact role, I presume was just to accompany Lembede as another Durban person, on this operation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And to your recollection, only Mr Taylor stayed behind at the range, at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is my recollection, yes sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, I am hoping you are going to tell me that you have had enough of this day.</p>
