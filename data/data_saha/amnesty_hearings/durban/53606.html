<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Nel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.  The application in front of you is that of Mr Verwey.  It is found in the Cele bundle on page 168, and in front of you I've had placed a short summary of the evidence.  If we can possibly mark that Exhibit - I think the next on is G.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> G, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Mr Verwey will be testifying in Afrikaans.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">A E VERWEY:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you, you may be seated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR NEL:</span> Thank you, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a>	Mr Verwey, you are applying in terms of the Act for amnesty, for your involvement in the abduction of the case that we have heard here, that would be Dion Cele, and any other offence which may emanate therefrom.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERWEY:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> You have heard the evidence of the previous applicants who have testified and you have also had the opportunity to peruse Exhibit A, do you confirm the correctness of that exhibit as well as the evidence given by the previous applicants regarding your involvement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERWEY:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Mr Verwey, during this incident you were stationed in the SAP at Middelburg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERWEY:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> You were at the Security Branch, and what was your involvement there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERWEY:</span> I was a Warrant Officer for the Security Branch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> And am I correct in saying that Col Taylor from the Durban Security Branch during this time contacted you to assist in an operation which would take place in Swaziland?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERWEY:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Now why would he have approached you specifically?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERWEY:</span> We worked in Swaziland regularly and we knew the roads and the environment very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Now as I've said, you have heard the evidence of the previous applicants and your involvement in this operation was exclusively to offer assistance with a possible, if I may call it, escape route from Swaziland to the RSA.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERWEY:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> You say, or you summarise the incident on page 172 of your application and that this is correct, with the exception that you mentioned in your application that Sam du Preez was also one of the members who was present during this operation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERWEY:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Am I correct in saying that during consultation and in consultation with Mr du Preez, it appeared clearly that you were mistaken and that he was not involved at all in this operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERWEY:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Furthermore, you summarise your political objective on page 174 in question 10(a) of your application.  Do you confirm the correctness thereof and request that this be incorporated in your application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERWEY:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Mr Verwey, do you ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you say 174, page 174 ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Of the bundle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Of the bundle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Sorry, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And this is question 10(a), which paragraph, paragraph 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, all of them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> All of them, Mr Chairperson.  That is the ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Did you draw any financial benefit or reward from your participation in this operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERWEY:</span> No, not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> After Cele had been taken from Swaziland, did you participate in any way in the interrogation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERWEY:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> And you and Labuschagne then returned to your station?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERWEY:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Mr Chairperson, that is the evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR NEL</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Mr Visser, are there any questions you with to put?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I have no questions, thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Is there any cross-examination at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> No, Mr Chair, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a>NO QUESTIONS BY MS THABETHE</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So the limit of your participation is to get this man out of Swaziland and when you got back into the country that was the end of your participation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERWEY:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Just one question, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a>	Did you have any inkling about what might happen to this man after you left the scene?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERWEY:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Thank you, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> I see in paragraph 9 of your application that you have applied for conspiracy to abduct.  Where you indeed a member of the planning or were you just told to be there so that you could indicate roads?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERWEY:</span> We were there because we knew the routes and the environment very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> But you were aware that this person was going to be abducted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR VERWEY:</span> Yes, we knew this before the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Thank you.  Thank you, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you very much.</p>
