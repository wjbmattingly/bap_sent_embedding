They are members of a political organisation.  The attacked in the context of political violence in the area, I don't think that can be disputed.  Mr Chairperson, on the full disclosure the only slightly disturbing aspect was the role of Master Shange and whether or not he had ordered the attack, I submit that it cannot be held that the applicants were less than candid in this regard.  They had disclosed his role fully, they were not trying to cover up for him, they disclosed openly and without reserve that he had in fact supplied weapons and that he had trained them and those are offences enough.  The only motivation that they could possibly have had for not mentioning his role was to cover up for him so that he could escape undetected and by disclosing the fact that he had trained them and that he had supplied them with weapons, they opened up this person to prosecution in any event so I cannot, with respect, see any reason as to why they wouldn't tell the full story.",
