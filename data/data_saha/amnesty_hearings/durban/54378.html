<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning everybody.  I see before us we have Exhibit P, the relevant extracts from the work entitled "Forensic Analysis of the Skull", by Iskan and Helmut.  Does everybody have a copy of this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> The pages Chairperson, by way of explanation, are only the ones that we referred to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You made reference to, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> But of course anyone is welcome to look at the whole thing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Mr Wills, you indicated yesterday that you'll be calling a witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes thank you, Mr Chairperson.  Two things have intervened.  I believe Ms Thabethe has been requested to recall Ms Stephanie Miller, so we've arranged that if that's acceptable, that she'll go first.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a>	I would like to just place on record at this stage, or make an application at this stage, Chairperson, that I apply to recall Dr Naidoo.  There was one bit of evidence which I didn't put to him, which I think is material.  He has been contacted and he would be available to come at midday today.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, I can't see any objection to that.  Is there any objection to that?  Yes certainly, Mr Wills.  Ms Thabethe, you say you wish to call Ms Miller.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a>	Ms Miller, do you swear that the further evidence that you give at this hearing will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, would you please raise your right hand and say I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">STEPHANIE MILLER:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ms Thabethe?   Sorry, is ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER MERWE:</span> Mr Chairman, may I assist.  I am under instructions from Mr Nel just to put a certain statement to the witness, which is as a result of the Exhibits Q1, 2 and 3, the Section 29, or so-called Section 29 hearings of Andy Taylor.  There's just one or two matters which he just wanted to make clear regarding the evidence that was led by Ms Miller during ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes thank you.  Mr Nel did approach me yesterday, not in connection with this evidence, but informed me and asked for leave to come late this morning because he had to go to the Magistrate's Court or something like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER MERWE:</span> That is correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr van der Merwe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER MERWE:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Does everybody have a copy of Exhibit Q1, 2 and 3?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR VAN DER MERWE ON BEHALF OF MR NEL:</span> Thank you, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a>	Mrs Miller, you during your evidence stated that you obtained certain information from Andy Taylor regarding this incident during the Section 29 investigation and questioning, can you recall that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MS MILLER:</span> I can.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER MERWE:</span> Have you since had an opportunity to look at Exhibits Q1, 2 and 3?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MS MILLER:</span> I haven't had a look at Exhibits Q1, 2 and 3, although I'm aware of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER MERWE:</span> Right.  Well firstly, there's a couple of points which I was asked to put on record.  If we look at Exhibit Q1, which is the transcript of the proceedings in terms of Section 29, you will notice on the second-last page of that, which is typed page 11, that the witness was never at any stage sworn in.  I was asked to just stress that point.  He was never under oath during this, this was an informal discussion up to that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MS MILLER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, just before you proceed, Mr van der Merwe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a>	Were you actually present at these proceedings which are recorded here, Mrs Miller?  27th of November 1996.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MS MILLER:</span> Mr Chairman, I was present when Mr Taylor prior - in the anti-room, prior to the hearings and I went in and out of the hearings, I did not stay for the ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No I can recall you saying that earlier.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MS MILLER:</span> And I recall being reprimanded for going in and out by the person having the hearings, that I should either be in or out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER MERWE:</span> Which is evident from the record, we can see that you were reprimanded there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a>	Secondly, when we look at Exhibit Q1, nowhere in this whole record is there any mention of the Ntombi Kubheka incident.  Would you agree with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MS MILLER:</span> I haven't read it, but it might well be.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER MERWE:</span> You can take my word for it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a>	Then further, when we look at Exhibit Q3 which is the affidavit by Andrew Russel Carol Taylor, in response to the letter which was written by the TRC, Exhibit Q2, he says there in paragraph 27, where he intends applying for amnesty - it's on page 13 of that:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a>"I will state that to be the case and will then deal fully therewith in my amnesty applications, in order to avoid unnecessary duplication and that will not be done here."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a>So in this application he would have dealt with matters only that he didn't apply for amnesty for.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MS MILLER:</span> My understanding is that questions - I must tell you I have not read this, but in discussions with my colleagues since we requested that this be supplied, or found ... (intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER MERWE:</span> Well let me help you out as far as that's concerned ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MS MILLER:</span> ... what I was advised was that a letter was written, which I do recall, was written to Mr Taylor putting a list of questions to him requesting ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That's Exhibit Q2.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER MERWE:</span> That's right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MS MILLER:</span> ... asking for increased information and that's exactly what happened, he omitted certain items, or didn't answer all the questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER MERWE:</span> That's right.  Let me help you.  Exhibit Q2, on the 6th page, paragraph 15, the question was posed to Mr Taylor regarding the abduction, torture and killing of Ntombi Kubheka and Sibo Phewa(?), in 1986.  When we go to the affidavit of Mr Taylor, where he deals with all these matters and the questions that were put to him, and that is in his affidavit, page 19, after paragraph 38 you will notice that he does not deal with the question in paragraph 15 of Q2.  He does not answer any questions in this affidavit.  So my instructions are to put to you that when you gave evidence to say you got this information during the Section 29 hearings, it cannot be true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MS MILLER:</span> That is not correct.  I thought I made it quite clear that I could not recall whether the information was acquired from Mr Taylor informally, in our discussions prior to the hearing or actually at the hearing.  I did not recall at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER MERWE:</span> Well it's quite evident now that it was not at the hearing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MS MILLER:</span> It appears so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR VAN DER MERWE:</span> Thank you, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR VAN DER MERWE</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you, Mr van der Merwe.  Mr Visser, any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a>NO QUESTIONS BY MR VISSER</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Hugo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> No thank you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a>NO QUESTIONS BY MR HUGO</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Wills?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> No questions, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a>NO QUESTIONS BY MR WILLS</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Samuel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUEL:</span> No questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a>NO QUESTIONS BY MR SAMUEL</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ms Thabethe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> No questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a>NO QUESTIONS BY MS THABETHE</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  Thank you, Mrs Miller, that concludes your evidence.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Wills?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairperson.  On behalf of the victim's families, I call the younger sister of the deceased in this matter, Ms Lyn Motoko Masetla nee Kubheka.  Mr Chairperson, Ms Masetla has elected to testify in English.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">LYN MOTOKO MASETLA:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Mr Wills?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR WILLS:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a>	Ms Masetla, you are the youngest child of the Kubheka family and the younger sister of the deceased in this matter, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> Yes, it is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Now as I understand it, you went into exile in December 1982 and it was around that time that you last saw your deceased sister.  At that stage she was living in eSikhawini, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> That's correct, but with a slight misinformation.  I last saw her in December 1982, but I left for exile in 1983, February.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Sorry, yes.  Now during the ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, can I just clarify, was she living in eSikhawini when he last saw her in December '82?</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> My sister was living at eSikhawini when I last saw her, but I was in KwaMashu, but we frequented her - I had gone to visit her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Okay, so you actually saw her in KwaMashu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> I had gone to visit her at eSikhawini.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Okay, fair enough.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, just before you proceed, MS Masetla, if you could just - how many brothers and sisters did you have?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> We were four sisters in the family and one brother, but of course two have since left us.  So we are now two sisters and one brother.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you very much.  Mr Wills.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Now just for the record, your brother is Themba Muzwake Kubheka, your surviving brother, and your surviving sister is Sibongile Gugu Kubheka, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> That's true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And they too are both older than yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> Yes, they are.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Well they tell me that you are the person in the family that most resembles the deceased in this matter, would you agree with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> Yes, I would, it looks like ...(indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry we couldn't hear properly, there was some banging on the microphone.  Ms Masetla, do you mind just repeating that answer please.  The question was put to you by Mr Wills - well the statement was put to you by Mr Wills, that he's heard that of all the siblings you were the one that most resembled Ntombi in appearance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> Yes, I agree.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Now you had regular contact with your sister prior to you going into exile, can you briefly describe to the Committee the type of person that she was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> If my memory serves me well, eSikhawini was opened around 1979 and then I went to stay with her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> That was because the husband then wasn't staying at eSikhawini, so she was on her own and the husband would go to eSikhawini over weekends because he was a taxi man.  But also additionally is the fact that I come from a very humble family.  My mother was a domestic servant and my father was a labourer and my sister being the eldest in the family, was more of a mother to us, to all of us, and as a result of that she left the school at an early age, she didn't finish - she didn't even go to her high school education because she had to help my parents with us because they couldn't afford to look after all five of us.  But especially with myself she was more of a mother because as Mr Wills has said, correctly so, that I was the baby of the family and she really looked after me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How many years younger than her were you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> I was born in 1958.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> I think approximately 19 years, is that correct?  She was born in '37.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> '46.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Sorry, 12 years, yes.  Now what about her generosity?  You've indicated a story about her in KwaMashu when she was living with your mother at KwaMashu, I think it would be quite important for you to relate that to the Committee briefly.  The story about the children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> My sister, as I've said because of the fact that she was the eldest and she felt like more of a mother, she behaved like more a mother to all of us.  She assumed that position and that was also clear with the children's neighbours or any other child that was younger than her that needed to be looked after.  And as a result our house ended up not just being a family house only, any other child that she would come across on the street, the child that is hungry, she would look after that child or start cooking, do all those things.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a>	But also it sums it up, the very fact that she looked after me as a mother, being the baby of the family and the very fact that when she took me to eSikhawini, she was my mother there.  She looked after me and anything that I needed I got from her.  The very fact that she even helped in schooling my brother, who then went to - proceeded with his education to high school level.  He went to boarding school.  All those responsibilities she assumed them to relieve my mother from them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Thank you.  Now what are the recollections of the physical appearance of your sister when you last saw her, which was late in 1982?  Can you comment on her height in relation to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> My sister was slightly taller than me, it might one or two centimetres as I'm 1.48.  She was slightly taller than me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I'm sorry, could I ask Ms Masetla to speak up, Chairperson, I've got my volume full blast on and she seems to swallow words that I don't quite hear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Could you just please repeat that, Ms Masetla, you said she was slightly taller than you, and then you mentioned one or two centimetres, is that what you said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> Yes I have, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And then did you mention your height?</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> Mine is about 1.48.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> 1,48?</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> Yes.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Now as regards to her general stature, her girth, I think you referred me to the photograph which appears in the bundle, Exhibit R, the colour photograph ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Which one in the bundle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> It's the second-last photograph.  We haven't labelled these, Mr Chairperson ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(indistinct - no microphone) seems to be sitting on a fence post.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Ja.  If we could just do that for convenience, Mr Chairperson.  If we go to Figure 25 ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes I think so, Mr Wills, let's do that.  We've got Figure 25, which is the bullets and then we've got a mother and child photo, that will be Figure 26.  Then we have the photograph of Ntombi sitting on a bed, that will be Figure 27.  Then we have this one that you're talking about now, sitting outside a house, that will be Figure 28.  Then we have the one of standing next to a motor vehicle, that would be Figure 29.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> 28 is what you're referred to as the "fence post"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes.  I'm showing the witness Figure 28 and just to get this in context, do you know when and who took this photograph?  When this photograph was taken and who took it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> The photograph was taken by myself when I was living with her at eSikhawini.  That was around the period of 1982.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> So we can therefore assume that this is what she looked like when you last remembered her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> This is how she looked like.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Now turning to the other photograph - I'm referring the witness, Mr Chairperson, to Figure 26, the mother and child photograph.  Now we know that - can you identify the baby in the photograph?</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> The baby is her daughter, Tulisile.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And the daughter was born on the 30th of March 1983, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> Yes, it is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And you would estimate as - Mr Chairperson, I'm leading the witness to save time, if there're any objections obviously I will take them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> But your estimation is that the baby is approximately six months old in this photograph, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> Yes, if my memory serves me right I had left already and this photograph might have been taken the second half of 1983.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes.  But that's an assumption based on the age of the child?</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, you say the photograph might have been taken in the second half of 1983?</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> Yes, it's true Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry I must have got it wrong then.  So when was the child born, the 30th of March '83?</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> Yes, it was Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I've got '86 here, I don't know why.  So the photo must have been taken plus-minus, or during the course of the second half of 1983.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes, but other than that - and obviously that is your sister in the photograph.</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> That's my sister.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Now this Figure 27, can you throw any light on this photograph as to when it was possibly taken?  This is the photograph, Mr Chairman, of the deceased sitting on a bed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> This photograph was also taken when I had left the country and it's after the birth of her child, when she was breastfeeding.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Now what makes you say that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> I'm saying this because my elder sister, the one who is still alive at this point, Gugu, was still in the country then, she hadn't left and when we were speaking with her because I didn't recognise it to have been taken whilst I was still in the country, she was certain that it was after that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Now just going back to Figure 28 ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Just before you do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a>	When did Gugu leave the country?</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> She left around 1986, if I'm not mistaken.</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Thanks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> But then maybe it's also - what I need to add is the fact that she is certain because she also did live with her at some point before she left the country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> You're saying Gugu live with your ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> Lived with my sister before she left the country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> ... with deceased for a while before she left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> Yes, at eSikhawini, at her place, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Now just returning to Figure 28, can you tell us where that photograph was taken?</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> This photograph was taken at eSikhawini, H105.</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> This is the house in the background?</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> Yes, that's her house at the background.</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Now turning to Figure 29, can you comment on approximately when this photograph was taken?</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> The photograph also on Figure 29 was taken when I had left the country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Now why do you say that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> I'm saying this because the house at the background is also the house at eSikhawini, H105, and when I lived with her then we didn't have any cars and the husband then was driving the taxi, the kombi that he was using, and he would be there only over the weekends.  And I know for the fact that after I had left the country they had a workshop which I think they still had until recently and my sister was also helping in working at the workshop.  So my assumption is that this car might be the client's car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, when you say a workshop, you mean a shop in which cars were serviced and repaired?</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Now Mr Chairperson, I don't know if these other photographs which we were given today, I don't think they've been given exhibit numbers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I don't think - we haven't been given them yet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> We haven't got them yet, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that the photograph referred to yesterday, the one that we saw on the video, the frontal photograph?</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes.  Maybe I've jumped the gun, I saw a pile of them when I was consulting downstairs, so possibly they are going to be handed in.  But be that as it may, I will refer to this and possibly - I don't know where the rest are ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think if that photograph's going to be handed in, we can at this stage call it R30.</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a>	Now looking at R30, are you able to say when this photograph might have been taken?</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> I'm not very certain, but this photograph is a passport or an ID size photograph that I found with mine.  It might have been around the '80s, when she was looking for the ID.  I cannot vouch for that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So when you found it, it was one of these small passport size photographs and it's been blown up now, obviously?</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> I had it in my possession, so it was just blown up.  It is myself who provided it when we were looking for - the doctors were looking for photographs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Can I just clarify something.  Was that obviously taken before you went into exile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> It looks like it was taken before I left for exile.</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And assuming it was ID photograph and used for an ID book, is it not so that we've been through documentation and we were able to establish that the ID number was issued before June 1980, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> Yes, it is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> So the chances are, on those facts, that this photograph might have been taken before that period.</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, you say the ID was issued before June...?</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> June 1980.</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now why do you pick on June?</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Mr Chairperson, all I can say is that we've tried to get the file at Home Affairs, it has disappeared.  The ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you get the June from the number, ID number or ...?</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> No, what has happened Mr Chairperson, and I don't think it's a contentious issue, we've gone through certain documentation and there was an application for a house, something to do with a house in eSikhawini and the ID number was placed on that application and that application was dated in June 1980.  So we're assuming that this photograph was used for purposes of that identification document.</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I understand, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Thank you.   We'll move off the photographs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a>	Now just turning to the dresses that have been labelled, Exhibits 5 and 6, tell me how did you come across those dresses?</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> The day that Mr Visser was asking for the other dresses we went home that afternoon and we went to look.  That's KwaMashu ...(indistinct) ...23.  We went to my mother's bedroom to look for my sister's dresses because we knew that there were bags that were containing their clothing.  That is the bag, the suitcase that contains my sister's belongings and the suitcases that contained my mother's belongings and the suitcases that contained my late sister's belongings.  So we opened those suitcases and whenever we'd be opening any one of them we would ask the children whose clothes are these and - that's my sister's children, particularly the elder one, the boy, because then he was big then and he knew where - he was staying with my mother in KwaMashu, he knew what was happening.  Then he was able to say - to identify my sister's suitcase.</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a>	And then we would take out the clothes from there and just open them, stretch them and show them to him and we'll verify whether any of the items of those clothings were my sister's, and he confirmed that with us.  When I talk about "we", I'm talking about my sister, Sibongile and myself, because I went home with her.  So that's how we identified those dresses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> So as I understand it, you went home to the family home in KwaMashu.  There were certain suitcases.  One was identified as being the one that contained your sister's, your deceased sister's belongings.  You opened the suitcase, took out two dresses and they were verified to be your sister's by Clifford Thamsung Kubheka, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> That's true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And then you brought them in to the Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Now you mentioned that Clifford - well, let me ask you, do you know how old Clifford was at the time of your mother's disappearance?</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> Clifford was born in ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, sister's disappearance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Sorry, sister's disappearance.  I'm terribly sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> Clifford was born in 1969, at the end of January.  He might have been about 18 around that period.</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairperson, I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR WILLS</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you, Mr Wills.  Mr Visser, do you have any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR VISSER:</span> Yes, thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a>	Can you tell us Mrs Masetla, what month of 1983 you left into exile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> I left in February 1983.  It might have been around the 14th of February.</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And were you aware of your sister, Ntombi Kubheka's political activities in the country?</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> No, I wasn't aware.</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You weren't.  Are you aware that your sister, Sibongile, made a statement to the TRC?  Gugu Sibongile.  It's in bundle 2, page 4.</p>

<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright.  If I may be personal now, because that was your evidence, it was about your own personal length and so on.  Mrs Masetla, would you mind terribly if during the tea adjournment we just took a measurement of your length?</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> I don't mind.</p>

<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  You see that's really the problem, because there were two measurements provided for you.  One of 1,58 and the other is 1.48.</p>

<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a>I say something and that is:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a>"Can we now know how tall Mrs Masetla is, otherwise the whole exercise is meaningless."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a>and the Chairperson makes a remark and Mr Wills says:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a>"1,58 seems to come from the gallery."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a>So he was told from the gallery 1,58 in relation to your length.  That's 10 centimetres taller than what the Doctor now measured you at.  So if you don't mind, we just take a quick measurement, make a mark on the wall and we'll know exactly what the story is.  If you don't mind.</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a>	And Chairperson, while I'm about that, we haven't had any feedback on Mrs Dludla.  I notice that she's here.  She signified that she would have no problem with that and perhaps we can do that in the teatime as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you.  Would you describe yourself as being a thinner person than Ntombi Kubheka, or do you say you are fatter or stouter than Ntombi Kubheka?  Or the same?</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> Not the same, but I'm not thinner to her.  I may be a little smaller, not thin.</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Would you generally say that Ntombi had small breasts or medium breasts or large breasts, how would you describe that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> Depending on the period like when she was breastfeeding, then of course the breasts would enlarge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, of course.</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> But I would - I'm trying to remember her before I left.  She had - the top was almost my size.</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Would 110 centimetres be approximately right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> I can't tell you, I'm not sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just for record purposes, seeing Mrs Masetla sitting here she certainly to me, does not appear to be a large woman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  Thank you, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a>	I want to just refer you to photographs in Exhibit R, and seeing that you've now referred to Exhibit R29 I'm going to through you, place something on record.  It seems that on Exhibit R29, the person on the photograph is standing next to a motor car.  I, Chairperson, can't make out what type of car it is, unfortunately.</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I tried to do so myself, but I couldn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> It would seem to be slightly larger than a middle sized car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It does seem to be quite a large car with a vinyl roof, I think.</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a>	And would you agree ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I would venture to suggest if it looks like anything, it might be like a Valiant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> In fact.  That's the closest I would guess, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a>	Would you agree on that photograph, Mrs Masetla, that the person standing next to the car is approximately a head taller than the top of the roof of the car?  If not more.  Given the fact that the car is obviously sloping downwards with its nose.</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> Looking at it roughly, I would agree.</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  Now do you know motorcars at all?  Do you know a Nissan Sentra?</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> I have an idea.</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes it's a medium sized, it's a smallish medium sized motorcar.  I want to put to you, and I do that for the reason that anyone can then check it if they disagree, that the top of the roof of a Nissan motorcar is 1,35 metres, given a millimetre or two either side - I'm not going to argue about that, but roughly 1,35 millimetres(sic).  Would you - well I wouldn't ask you to agree with it or not, I'm just placing it on record.  And I'm putting to you that if you took the measurement of a person's head, it would come to approximately 20/30 centimetres, which would bring us to around 1,6 metres.  Was that how tall Ntombi Kubheka was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> I cannot estimate that, but all I can say certainly for sure was that she was slightly taller than me, as I said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  Would you really ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Just to be fair, Mr Visser, you did run the thing right along your head from around, rather than in a straight.</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Chairperson, this is not a scientific evidence, but 25/30 does - around 1,6.</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, 30 centimetres in the old terminology is a foot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> My hand is 8 inches.</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, 37 would be a ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So it's less than 30.</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Ja, make it 25, plus 1,35 brings you to around 1,6.</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a>	Would you Mrs Masetla, ever have described your sister, Ntombi Kubheka, as a considerably short person?  Would you have described yourself as a considerably short person?  As a female person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> I am short myself, but it's easier for me and also as we were growing up, you know we are - my family is not tall, but it's easier for me if I make it in relation to us, because I'm taller than my sister.</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Which sister?</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> My sister, Sibongile.</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Sibongile.</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> So this is why it's easier for me to say my sister was slightly taller because the two that are late, were slightly taller than us.  So it's not tall in general, but it's compared to the other members of the family.</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, I accept that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> This is why it's easier for me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Fair enough.  And Ntombi Kubheka's daughter, she's very tall, isn't she?</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> Yes, she is.  I don't have to justify that also, but it's important to note that the father's side is very tall and in all respects she resembles the father.  In the same fashion you look at the son also, he is tall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes 1,7 or something.</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> We do not - when we reflect on the height of the family, like I'm saying I'm comparing my sister with her siblings, we do not reflect on them because the children are taller.</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  Mrs Masetla, you said that on photograph, Exhibit R27, if I understand your evidence correctly this photograph was taken after you had left in - you said February ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Are you referring to R27?</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The photograph of Ntombi sitting on the bed with what seems to be some money and a note book.</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a>	Now you say, or you said in your evidence:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a>"This was taken when I left the country"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a>now do you mean to say this was taken after you had left the country?</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> "After I had left the country", qualifying that is the fact that my sister knew the house more than I did then because she had lived with my sister, but also for me she's counting money.  She had no business then when I was still in the country and the only business they had was one of the taxis which of course the husband when he was staying here in Durban, in Inanda, he only went to eSikhawini, joined her or joined us at eSikhawini over weekends.  So she had no reason to count the money.</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a>	Now this is why I'm saying "after I had left", because they had a business of the car workshop and she worked in that business, she ran it, that business.  So for me she's counting the money.  And my sister confirmed that she recognised the bedspread.  She recognised the fact that my sister was breastfeeding then.  So those are all the factors that made me realise that, or roughly say I had left the country already.</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, you know I was really only going to ask you whether anybody thought that at the time when this photograph was taken, Mrs Kubheka was pregnant.  But that's not your inference, is it, that she was pregnant at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> Myself I did - maybe you picked up the passage talk, I did say on the corridors when we were talking, we were trying to speak to recognise ...(indistinct) I did say "Sibo, wasn't she pregnant at that time?"  That's what I thought, and Sibo said - that's my sister, she said "No, she was breastfeeding."  ...(indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> So it's really her evidence, not yours, that's what you're saying?  You're drawing all sorts of inferences from she told you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> I think I've qualified that with my reasoning also, that there is money being counted, she's got a book there and when I was staying with her before I left the country, that facts was not there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> When did ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> So I qualified hers with mine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> When did the husband, as you referred to him, start with his taxi business?  Wasn't it at the time between 1979 and '83, when you lived with Ntombi Kubheka?</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> He was - Kehla, Kehla Ngcobo, he was a taxi man even before they met with my sister.  He was coming from Inanda area.  He was running taxis in this area, Inanda and Durban.</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And I take it as a good husband, sometimes he would give Ntombi Kubheka money, surely?</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> Yes of course, he would give her money, but I did say she had no reason to count the money and also I know very well, it's a fact that I stayed with her.  I went to stay with her when eSikhawini was opened, because it was a new area.  I went to stay there with her.  I know for the fact.</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  When you say Exhibit R26 refers to the daughter, are you talking about the person who is referred to as Tuli?</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> That's Tulisile Pheki.</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  And that is the daughter sitting here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> That's the only daughter she has, the one sitting here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you ever know this child as a baby, or had you left already?</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> Come again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you know this child as a baby?</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> I didn't know her as a baby, I had left.  She was born shortly after I had left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  So how would you know that this - because you were asked and you said</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a>"This is her when she was six months old."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> Did I say she was six months old?</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, indeed, you were led to say that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You said approximately six months old and it was estimated that this photograph was taken in the latter part of 1983, and the child was born as far as I can recall you saying, in March 1983.  I think that was what was said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> When I said roughly the second half of 1983, I knew because I was sent the photos of her as a baby and amongst the collection of my photos I've got her there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Now I want to talk to you about that collection of photographs.  Do you have more photographs of Ms Ntombi Kubheka?</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> Apart from the ones that I provided, I do not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You do not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> In September last year - let me ask you this first, do you live in Pretoria?</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> I live in Johannesburg, I stayed in Pretoria then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright.  In September last year we were told that one of the sisters, and I think it was you, had photographs in Pretoria of Mrs Ntombi Kubheka and that they would be provided later ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Sorry, where was that told, Mr Chairperson?  If we can just refer to the record in that regard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Chairperson, if Mr Wills wants to dispute that, that was said by Mr Wills to both Mr Wagener and myself in the hall during an adjournment after we had for about the fourth time, asked for photographs.  But if Mr Wills wants to dispute it, Chairperson, let me read to you what is at page 1905.  Mr Wills in the second part of - one third from the bottom</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a>"CHAIRPERSON:   Have you had an opportunity to discuss the possibility of going off on an inspection?"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a>says the Chairman.  </p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a>"MR WILLS:   Yes, thank you, Mr Chairperson.  Firstly, on the photographs I just want to place on record that the family have no problem in handing over photographs.  The problem being, is that the family's homes are no longer in the KwaZulu Natal area and the family is employed in Pretoria and obviously Mr Kubheka is in Denmark, but we will endeavour to get those photographs as soon as possible and hand them over.  We have no objection to do that.  I have discussed with Wagener they types of photographs he wants and we'll try to oblige him in that regard."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a>That's what I'm referring to.  That's the discussion I'm referring to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Mr Chairperson, if I could just emphasise this because much play is being made in this regard.  We have tried to oblige in that regard.  We have done searches, the family have done searches for photographs.  At no stage did I say we have definitely got photographs.  I, as can be seen from the context of this transcript, I certainly have never seen the photographs.  We assumed that there may be photographs in Pretoria, searches have been done and no additional photographs have been found.</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes but when - at that stage did we have these photographs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, where did these photographs come from?  I mean we've got photographs and they're here in these Figures, 26 etcetera, 26 to 30.</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Now these photographs, Mr Chairperson, were handed to the - as I understand it, were handed to the Truth Commission much before my involvement in this matter and they were retained by the persons giving medical evidence, and after the searches for photographs it was established that there were no other photographs and that these were the only remaining photographs.  And all I can say, and I don't think Mr Visser's being fair, with respect he's trying to say that we are - the inference of his evidence is that we are trying hide evidence from this Commission, and with respect, that isn't the case.  Searches have been done for photographs and no other photographs can be found.  It's as simple as that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Mr Chair, can I also put it on record that the TRC did not have any photographs in their possession.</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you, Ms Thabethe.  Mr Visser?</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Chairperson, may I ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You see there can't be - I'm just thinking aloud, I can't see any reason why some photos would be made available and not others.  I mean you don't have a photograph of - you know if you're going to hand five or six, if there's five or six available, there's no real reason why others should be withheld.</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Except one thing Chairperson, and that is I'm going to make certain, and I may say strong submissions in this regard to the Panel at the end of the day, because Chairperson, you will recall that we didn't just ask for photographs, we knew that what was in issue here were the length and the girth of Mrs Kubheka and possibly the teeth.  We asked specifically for two types of photographs.  One, showing her teeth and another type of photograph being a group photograph, preferably by people standing in a group with her, identifiable people.  Those are the photographs we've asked.  There was never any talk about any other photographs, those were the ones we were interested in.  That's what we discussed with Mr Wills and we asked this Committee all the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes.  If I can just add to that.  I concede that and I will place on record that I requested my clients to search for photographs like that.  When they - after the last hearing, when they went back to Pretoria they conducted searches to that effect and my instructions were to the effect that there are no other photographs and I had communications I think in writing with Ms Thabethe prior to the setting up of this hearing, where that fact was known, that the only photographs that were available were those given to the medical practitioners and the family has not objection in those being handed over to Mr Visser.</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes thank you, Mr Wills.  Mr Visser.</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you, Chairperson.  If I may continue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a>	You referred to a photo album, is that what you referred to just now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Collection.</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Collection, sorry.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a>	What do you mean by a photo collection?  Is it in an album or what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> My photo collections as it is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Is it in an album, a photo album?</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> I suppose it entails both because I've got the photos that are not in an album, I've got photos in an album.  But maybe before I come to that question, can I before we seal up the previous question of the photographs?  One, if we had known and you have clearly stated that you wanted the photos that were showing the teeth, as the family we were going to say or respond back to say even the Doctors had asked when they were asking for photos.  They had asked for the photos specifically amongst others, the photos that would be showing the teeth where she is smiling or laughing so to speak, so that it will be easier for them, but we were not able to provide that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a>	But also what comes up is the fact that my sister stays, Sibongile Gugu, she stays in Pretoria, so you cannot specifically say I stay in Pretoria and you asked for it.  We both stay in Pretoria, so it wasn't necessarily put clear which one was going to find the photos, but being members of the family, both, we were going to look in our collections for the photos.</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a>	The photos that are available and I'm talking about, I've stressed that's the photos that I have provided.  And for the fact the photos that are here are my copies.</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is this your entire set depicting the deceased, Ntombi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> These are the copies I had of my sister that were left.  The other copies that I had been sent whilst I was outside - I wasn't in one country, in one occasion I was in Swaziland where my suitcase was taken and was never brought back, when the house I was staying in was searched by the Swazis, so I lost those copies there.  I'm just only left with these copies that are here.  So I provided all these photos.  Thank you, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Visser.</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a>	Are you a person who likes collecting photographs of your family?</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And your sister, Sibongile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> She does keep family photographs of course.</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You know what I find amazing is that in total we have five photographs of a person who grew to the age of 41 years and who had three sisters and a brother and a mother and a father, it's just amazing ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Hang on, why is it so amazing, Mr Visser?  With the greatest of respect, the sort of tone of your question is not fair and I'm a bit unhappy about it.  To say that it's amazing - you've been told of their financial circumstances, I mean you're making all sorts of assumptions in saying it's amazing that there are no other photographs, about their financial ability, their economic status, access to cameras.  With the greatest of respect, I think it's a bit of an insensitive question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I will argue it, you don't have to answer it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> I'm not going to be answering it, but I think it's important to be stated here that more than anything we feel that we have been tried as family, especially by you, Mr Visser.  You do not seem to show any remorse at all.  By rights the Special Branch had been behind our family for years, all of us.  They kept photographs which wherever you go or any person from the area or from Durban itself, goes wherever, whether you pass through the border or whether you are taken for questioning, you'll be shown that album.  People came and told us "You are in that album, your whole family is there."  And as our representative, our lawyer, Mr Wills has said, we were not and still are not under intentions at all to hide any evidence.  But so far as we are concerned up until now, you have hiding everything.  You should have provided us with the photos that you have kept of us, or your clients so to speak.  So it's very sad and I think you are trying me more than anything.  You are pushing us to the limit.  Thank you, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you, Mrs Masetla.  Mrs Masetla, are you alright?</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> Yes, I'm fine, thank you Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Visser?</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a>	Now the son Clifford, was he living permanently with Ntombi Kubheka, or what was the position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> Clifford he never lived with the mother, he was living in my mother's house, but of course he will frequent the mother from time to time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> He lived with his grandmother and visited his mother, is that what you're saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> He would visit his mother, yes of course.</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> From time to time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Where did he attend school?</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> He studied in Botha's Hill, he studied in KwaMashu, he studied in Lesotho.</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> In Lesotho.  His high school career, where was that, in Lesotho or here in Natal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> It was both in Natal and in Lesotho.</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  And what I understand from your evidence today is the two dresses, Exhibits 5 and 6 that were here, that were brought here, were really identified by him as belonging to Ntombi Kubheka.</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> Yes, I did say that, that we took them out, we confirmed with him if the dresses were the mother's.</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  Why not with Tuli, for example?</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> Tuli was young, she was a baby.</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I see.  Why do you suppose have these dresses been kept for thirteen years and haven't been given to the daughters?</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> Traditionally that wouldn't be done.  I've told you that we have my mother's things and we've got my sister's clothes, who has passed away, we've got Sisi Ntombi's clothes.  Up till now, maybe it's still not up till now, until the truth be told we are going to be keeping those things until all the rituals have been done and they are cleansed and then we can then divide them amongst ourselves or they can be given to whoever it available at that point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I'm sorry, I didn't quite follow you.  You say it will be divided up at some point, after what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> When we have finished with the rituals, when the clothes have been cleansed, when we have buried my sister and closed the case up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright.</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How are these clothes being stored at the moment, Mrs Masetla?  You've talked about the clothes of your mother and of Ntombi and your other sister.</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> They are in suitcases in my mother's bedroom in KwaMashu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are they all together, or what is the situation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> My mother's are in her bags in the suitcases on their own, they're not mixed so to speak Mr Chair.  My other late sister's, Tuli, they are in their suitcases and my elder sister, Ntombi, they are in her own suitcase.  So each one of the belongings are kept differently.</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Were there any other clothes belong to Ntombi Kubheka in that suitcase?</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> Yes, there were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Can you give us any idea of what it was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> What do you mean what it was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What kind of clothes were they?  In the suitcase.</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You're talking ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Dresses, shirts ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Dresses, shirts, slax, shoes, jewellery, whatever?</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> There are dresses, there are shirts, they are skirts, there are belts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  Would there be any objection if we could look at them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> If you could?</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Look at the suitcase and the contents of the suitcase.</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> Do you want us to bring the suitcase and the contents?</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That's what I'm asking.  Would there be an objection to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> There wouldn't be any objection, but I think after what I have raised with the way you have treated us, personally I would ask why do you want to see them and if you give me a valid reason for me to bring them, I would do that, but I don't see why I should be bringing them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Now Mrs Masetla, that's the second time you've blamed me for acting untowards to you.  Now I want to put it to you that I'm here to do my work as a lawyer for my clients.  I've not been disparaging to you or anyone of your family.  I've gone up to those that I know are members of Kubheka's family, to your brother for example, I've introduced myself to him, to the daughter as well.  I greet them every day.  And I reject your imputation that I acted incorrectly towards you.  Okay?</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> Thanks very much, I appreciate it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR VISSER</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Mr Hugo, do you have any questions you'd like to put to Mrs Masetla?</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a><span class="speaker">MR HUGO:</span> No questions, thank you Mr Chairman.</p>

<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I've got a note here from Mr Samuel, excusing him and in which it is also stated that he has no questions for you.  Ms Thabethe, do you have any questions you'd like to put?</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Yes, Mr Chair, I do.  But maybe before I do Mr Chair, I just want to put it on record that as the TRC, to the family we are very sorry that we had to put you through this, we realise how tough and how strenuous it has been on you as a family.  We are very sorry.  Especially with the clothes, I know traditionally clothes of a person who is deceased, you're not supposed to hang them anyhow, you know display them and everything.  Traditionally it shows disrespect, so we are very sorry that we had to put you through that.  On behalf of the TRC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS THABETHE:</span> Now you have mentioned that Ms Kubheka, Ntombi the deceased was a bit taller than you in 1982, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> Yes, it's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Now what I want to find out is, how old were you in 1982 would you say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> I was born in 1958.</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You would be 24, plus-minus.</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> In the early '20s, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Plus-minus 24.</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Okay.  And would you say in - you've been this height since 1982, or have you grown since then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> No, I haven't been this height since 1982.</p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> So how tall do you think you were in 1982?  Or maybe let me not put it that way.  Do you think you were shorter than what you are now, in 1982?</p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> I'm not sure, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> I'll tell you why I'm asking this question.  I'm trying to ascertain, you are saying Ms Ntombi Kubheka was taller than you in 1982, and I'm not sure whether ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you know what your height was in 1982, Mrs Masetla?</p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> No, I don't recall Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It would be unusual for people to still be growing when they're 24.</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Is it, Mr Chair?</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well as far as I know, normally by the time you're 18 you've stopped growing.  The older you get you start shrinking after a while, but when you're 24, I'd say that you may have - unless there's something unusual, but I think it's general knowledge that most people when they're 24 have reached their height.</p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Okay Mr Chair, I have no further questions.  Thank you.</p>

<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Wills, do you have any re-examination?</p>

<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a>NO RE-EXAMINATION BY MR WILLS</p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Lax, do you have any questions you'd like to put?</p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Sorry Mr Chair, before Mr Lax, can I impose please.  I just wanted to put something else on record.</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> About the pregnancy issue on the photograph ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The photograph of ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Ja.  I actually stated that on record that I thought I heard someone saying she might have been pregnant, but I was going to follow it up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> So I just want to put it on record that I didn't say it for certain that she was pregnant, I said I heard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Thanks, Chair.  There was only aspect and that was on the question of the photographs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a>	You had more photographs of the deceased but you've lost some of them over time.  That's what I understood your evidence to be, do I understand it correctly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> Yes, you do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And the photographs that you have in your collection as you call it, those were either taken before you left or had been posted to you while you were in exile.</p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> Both.  Some of them before I left but some of them when I was outside I was sent some copies.</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> But also when my mother came for the wedding she brought other photographs.  But as usual, we were not able to come back with all the things that we have, coming back from exile.</p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Yes.  My only question was, by some other chance, are there any other possible photographs that you might have received while you were in exile, that you might have?  I'm saying you may have other boxes lurking somewhere that you may have put away that you might have forgotten about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> That might be possible.  Not in my boxes so to speak, maybe in my in-law's place in Soweto, because I've got the things that are there, so that might be possible, I can't guarantee it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Yes.  All I'm asking is, you know when one generally looks in your possessions, you don't always think about you might have something somewhere else, like that.  So that's why I was asking.  And in fact, you may find there are other of your possessions elsewhere that you hadn't thought about, like now you're mentioning your in-laws.</p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Could you possibly - I know that we're probably going to conclude these proceedings for the moment, but would you kindly go and look amongst those things and if there are other possible photographs maybe, it would just help us if you could make them available please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> I will try that.  It might not be immediate, but I can be available to do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Within the next week or two, possibly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> That may be close.  If I do come across something I'll provide it, but if there's nothing I will also let Mr Wills know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Thank you, we would just appreciate that.</p>

<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Advocate Bosman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> ...(inaudible) comment.  Mrs Masetla, lawyers are a special breed, don't judge them too harshly.  We are also victims of our occupations sometimes, so don't take it too personally.</p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> Thank you, Advocate Bosman.  I wasn't necessarily looking it as the approach of the lawyer so to speak, but I notice - I don't want to pursue it further, but I noticed it personally and as I say, I wasn't saying all of them or whatever, some of them have been very kind.  To say hello, I am so and so, it doesn't necessarily reflect that you are being kind to a person or whatever.  But as I say, I wouldn't like it to be a fight or an attitude towards Mr Visser or whatever.  I was just commenting that this is how the family has felt, because of the reasons that I have stated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> No, we understand that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a><span class="speaker">MS MASETLA:</span> We know for the fact that they had records.</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> No, we understand your vulnerability in the circumstances.</p>

And I can assure you that we at the TRC, certainly in no ways ever mean to cause any disrespect or harm to the family.  We thank you for testifying.  That concludes the testimony.</p>

<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes, 24/7/2000.</p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a>... when another Dr S Naidoo, I think being one of the District Surgeons in Durban, took certain measurements and heights in relation to Sibongile Gugu Kubheka, Lyn Motoko Masetla, Themba Muzwaki Kubheka, Clifford Tamsanqa Kubheka and Peggy Tulisili Kubheka?</p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> Yes, I was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And is it not so that he took the weights and heights of each of these individuals?</p>

<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And you were present when I recorded the weights and heights, is that correct?</p>

<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well Chairperson, what's the point of giving him the evidence?  Why is he recalled to ...  I thought he was coming to testify as to what he knows.</p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Wills.</p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Well possibly - Dr Naidoo was present when I was the scribe at that stage, possibly I can give him my notes and he can confirm that that note was taken at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Chairperson that's pointless, with great respect, I mean we may as well read it out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is your stance ... No, I hear what you're saying Mr Visser, but are you going to dispute the correctness of those heights and measurements or ...?</p>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Chairperson, we have a problem with this.  We've asked you, the Committee, whether we can take height measurements ourselves.  The witnesses have agreed to that.  Mr Wills doesn't want to allow us to do that.  We've got two different heights of Mrs Masetla on record now.  There's clearly a disparity of 10 centimetres.  But if that's the evidence which Mr Wills wishes to present, Chairperson, I'm not going to stop him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes alright Mr Wills, continue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Mr Chair, shouldn't we do it now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Mr Chairperson, I just want to record that I'm offended by Mr Visser's suggestion that as an officer of the court I would be given notes by the District Surgeon and I record that incorrectly.  It's an affront to my stature as an officer of the court in this matter, and I'm in no way intending to try and mislead the Commission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes no, I'm satisfied of that, Mr Wills.</p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I wasn't imputing that, Chairperson.  The point is just that the witness is being called to give evidence as to the correctness of the contents of what Mr Wills heard and noted down and that's what it's about.  He may have heard it incorrectly, he may have written it down incorrectly.  I don't know, Chairperson, I wasn't there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well perhaps we can just find out on that point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a>	Dr Naidoo, when these measurements were taken by the District Surgeon, you were present and Mr Wills was present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> That's quite - I observed it and read out the heights and weights to Mr Wills, who recorded it.</p>

<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And I'm not imputing anything, Mr Wills, by asking that question, I assure you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line568"><a name="pos568"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> ... out of the corner adjacent to me, Mr Wills was recording.  I didn't look specifically to make sure that he'd recorded the correct figures, but you know I know he was recording ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> From information spoken by yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line570"><a name="pos570"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> Yes, verbally.</p>
<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, I think you can continue, Mr Wills.</p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a>	Possibly - we don't have a scale here but I believe that Mr Visser has a tape measure, possibly we could measure one of the, or the persons here in order to establish the heights.</p>
<p class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think if you can proceed with your evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, I was going to say, if you want to do that I don't have any objection to it personally, but before we break to do that little exercise, because we'll obviously have to do it here against the wall or whatever, I just had one or two other questions that have arisen since we heard other evidence today, that I thought that I might want to ask the Doctor, but I'll do that when you've finished.</p>
<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes.  That isn't particularly the reason that I recall Dr Naidoo, it only became contested later.  I thought the height became contested after Dr Naidoo's evidence and hence I led this, but there is another issue which I will go onto.</p>
<p class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a>	Dr Naidoo, I turn now to the issue that I recalled you for, and that is in relation to the height of Lyn Motoko Masetla.  She gave the height - she was measured at the District Surgeon at 1.48 metres.  She gave evidence today that Ntombi Kubheka, her deceased sister was one or two centimetres taller than her.  Now I want to refer you to your formula, Lundi's formula, and ask you outright whether or not if somebody was either 1.49 metres or 1.5 metres, would this be an exclusionary factor in regard to your findings as to the identity of the deceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> Yes, my answer would be, not really.  No, there wouldn't be an exclusion.  For that matter it would be not impossible, but inappropriate to exclude any specific height.  What happens is that as you go out of the range that I calculated, then the probability shrinks.  Whilst the possibility may be there at all stages, but the probability shrinks and shrinks till it becomes negligible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So it's not progressive?</p>
<p class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> That's right, yes.  I in fact - as the Commission would read that I actually made a note that</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a>"Please note, the above formula provides not the precise estimation and the actual height calculated may be considered to be inaccurate.  However, the figures do point to a considerably short individual."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a>You know I think with due respect, you know very much like facial reconstruction and these parameters, what we're doing is giving some guidance and leaning towards a particular area of a person.  It would be certainly incorrect to state that we could calculate a very precise age, or even a reasonably precise age and a weight, a height.</p>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a>	I would think that - you mentioned 1,49 or 1,5, that would be 8 centimetres.  Yes.  That would naturally be a closer, amount to a closer more probable you know, give you more probability than 1.6.  So I can't say very much more than that, apart from saying that it wouldn't amount to an exclusion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line585"><a name="pos585"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And obviously it would be less probable than 1.42?</p>
<p class="line" id="line586"><a name="pos586"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> Yes, that's right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Just on the genetic makeup of siblings as opposed to children, is it likely that, is it more likely that Ntombi Kubheka would reflect the makeup of her siblings in a more dominant way than that of her children?  Are you able to comment on that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line588"><a name="pos588"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> Yes.  Now if you look at it, that would be correct simply because there's a constant and repetitive phenotype that we call the phenotype, the outward expression of a genetic makeup in the family.  What would - biologically or mathematically speaking, both would represent, a child and a sibling could represent, possibly, similar deviations or shall we say, a similar amount of phenotypic outward expression of genetic makeup, simply because the child for example, would be a product of the mother and an external(?) father, whilst a sibling could, there's a possibility, could receive the gene that was not present in Ntombi Kubheka, but present in a sister.  However, simply because there seems to be some constancy in that most of the siblings, or for that matter all of them are shorter than normal.  So what it shows as a probability is that both the mother and father in the Kubheka family, of all the siblings, had shortness as their genetic genotype.  DNA makeup.</p>

<p class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well we'll leave that to you, we don't really - we've seen Mr Kubheka every day, we've seen the Sisi.

<p class="line" id="line596"><a name="pos596"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes, and then possibly at the same time we can satisfy the query about Mrs Dludla.</p>

Do you want to do that now before I ask people if they want to cross-examine Dr Naidoo on this further evidence, then we can have that as part of his evidence, or will it be measured and then handed in by consent?  I don't know what you want to do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line598"><a name="pos598"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> As you please, Mr Chairperson, perhaps that will be convenient.</p>

<p class="line" id="line642"><a name="pos642"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> What does a confidence interval mean?</p>
<p class="line" id="line643"><a name="pos643"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No.  What do you mean by saying that you don't know whether there's a confidence interval ...(indistinct - coughing) these measurements?</p>
<p class="line" id="line644"><a name="pos644"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> I have no - I'm not too sure of what the statistics would actually call that range.  Whether it's a range of values and with it comes a confidence interval, such as to say that 95% of cases in the general population with that height of femur, measurement of femur, will fall within that range, I have not really looked into that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line645"><a name="pos645"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What did you intend this Committee to understand when you gave the evidence of the 95% confidence range?  What did you want us to understand you to mean?</p>
<p class="line" id="line646"><a name="pos646"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> That the - broadly speaking, most people with that height, most South African black females with that measurement of femur, should be within that range of height.  That was all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line647"><a name="pos647"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Of 1,35 to 1,42?</p>
<p class="line" id="line648"><a name="pos648"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line649"><a name="pos649"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And didn't you intend to express the opinion that that would be 95% accurate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line650"><a name="pos650"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> Yes, if that was the confidence interval that we're looking at, if that expression of that range is a 95% confidence interval, then that's what it would be intended to mean.</p>
<p class="line" id="line651"><a name="pos651"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Frankly I just don't understand your answer, but let's go on.  Would you also perhaps recall that ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line652"><a name="pos652"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Sorry Mr Chair, if my learned friend doesn't understand the answer, would he like maybe to give an opportunity for the Doctor to explain such that he understands?</p>
<p class="line" id="line653"><a name="pos653"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It's up to him if he wants to ask.</p>
<p class="line" id="line654"><a name="pos654"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> It's up to him, not - okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line655"><a name="pos655"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Doctor Naidoo, when I cross-examined you yesterday I asked you whether the bottom range of 1,35 and the top range of 1,42 were the two extremes, do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line656"><a name="pos656"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> I'm not too sure of the actual wording, but I ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line657"><a name="pos657"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Those were the words.</p>
<p class="line" id="line658"><a name="pos658"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> ... you discussing that, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line659"><a name="pos659"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Those were the words from my notes.  And I specifically asked you whether it is your evidence that if the actual height of the person sought to be identified from the skeleton, fell outside those limits, whether you would consider that to be a rule-out.  Do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line660"><a name="pos660"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line661"><a name="pos661"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, and you said yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line662"><a name="pos662"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> I can't recall the actual question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line663"><a name="pos663"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Oh well Doctor Naidoo, what you said here today is directly in conflict with your evidence of yesterday, and the record will show it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line664"><a name="pos664"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> Do we have a record of it?  No, not at this stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line665"><a name="pos665"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line666"><a name="pos666"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I'll look at my notes now, not that my notes are verbatim.  Sorry Mr Visser, you say that he testified that - you're putting it to him that he testified that if it fell without the parameters, it's a rule-out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line667"><a name="pos667"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> It's a rule-out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line668"><a name="pos668"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But before I look at my notes, my understanding was that he did say that there was this 95% confidence level, so ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line669"><a name="pos669"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, I'm just coming to that Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line670"><a name="pos670"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I didn't understand that it would be a rule-out because what happens to the other 5%?</p>
<p class="line" id="line671"><a name="pos671"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I'm just going to put that to him now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line672"><a name="pos672"></a>	If one assumes, if one assumes a 5% error margin and if one assumes that your evidence did not intend to mean that it would fall within that limit but outside the limits, I suggest to you that we still don't come by the length that we now know Mrs Kubheka was, namely approximately 151/152 centimetres, according to Mrs Masetla.</p>
<p class="line" id="line673"><a name="pos673"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> Well what I recall yesterday was - I think I recall we spoke about a 1,6 metres in height and I indicated 20 centimetres is the difference between the upper limit on this side and that carries with it a lower probability.</p>
<p class="line" id="line674"><a name="pos674"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well we spoke about rule-outs, Doctor, let's not speak about probabilities here.  What would you regard ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line675"><a name="pos675"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> But you see you can't rule out anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line676"><a name="pos676"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I see.</p>
<p class="line" id="line677"><a name="pos677"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> I think we, it's a play on words, there's nothing that you can rule out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line678"><a name="pos678"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> We're not playing with words, Doctor Naidoo ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line679"><a name="pos679"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If I could just ask a question just for my own clarity, and correct me if I'm wrong.  I'll tell you what I understood, was that you take the femur, you do the measurements of the femur and the other long bones and you apply Lundi's formula and you come up with an answer and in your case you came up with this parameter of 1,35 to 1,42 and you said that there is a 95% confidence level.  My understanding was that that 95%, or alternatively the remaining 5%, didn't relate to figures.  In other words, it wasn't that 1,35 to 1,42 was 95%, it might be 5% either way or either way.  My understanding is that 95% of the population of that particular group would fall in that range.</p>
<p class="line" id="line680"><a name="pos680"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> That's right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line681"><a name="pos681"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You might however get somebody with a very short femur and a long torso who might be 12 centimetres or 20 centimetres, a sort of freakish type growth, who would fall in the 5%.</p>
<p class="line" id="line682"><a name="pos682"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line683"><a name="pos683"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And that person falling out of that 95%, didn't have to be within 5% of 1,42 or 1,35.</p>
<p class="line" id="line684"><a name="pos684"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> That's so, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line685"><a name="pos685"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That was my understanding.  It didn't relate to figures, that 95% and 5%, to the measurements.</p>
<p class="line" id="line686"><a name="pos686"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> That's right.  It's an expression of the population ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line687"><a name="pos687"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(indistinct) to probabilities of ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line688"><a name="pos688"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> ... that will into that, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line689"><a name="pos689"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, that's what my understanding was, but anyway ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line690"><a name="pos690"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> I thought I'd specifically canvassed that with you, because that's how I understand these sorts of statistical tests where a sample of people, a hundred individuals of a particular group are taken, they represent and mean of the population and what I understood when you said 95% confidence, from my little knowledge of statistics, that means that that's a 95% sample of the population for which those figures are then valid with, given the fluctuation that's how statistics work.</p>
<p class="line" id="line691"><a name="pos691"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line692"><a name="pos692"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And that there's in fact, this confidence represents the 5% of the population who fall outside of that sample.</p>
<p class="line" id="line693"><a name="pos693"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line694"><a name="pos694"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> In other words, the sample didn't - you never sample for 100% of the population, you'd have to do every single individual.</p>
<p class="line" id="line695"><a name="pos695"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> That's right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line696"><a name="pos696"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So statistically that's how it's done.</p>
<p class="line" id="line697"><a name="pos697"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line698"><a name="pos698"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I'm sorry, Mr Visser, I can't seem to find anything in my notes.  I'm not saying that it wasn't, I just haven't recorded anything to the effect there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line699"><a name="pos699"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Chairperson, may I explain myself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line700"><a name="pos700"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line701"><a name="pos701"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I'm giving the Doctor the benefit of the 5%.  I hear everything that Mr Lax says and what you said and that's certainly as I understood it.  I have now asked him whether - I've now assumed that it's also applicable to the range, to give a further leeway, Chairperson.  It's only on that basis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line702"><a name="pos702"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line703"><a name="pos703"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You see Mr Visser, the problem is this, is that 5% is not adding on 5% of the fluctuation in height, you can't take those - let's take 1,42 as the extreme, add on 5% and then get the external mean so to speak, or the maximum.</p>
<p class="line" id="line704"><a name="pos704"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, I'm perfectly happy with that, Doctor.  So on that basis I will put to you that if we know that Ms Kubheka might have been 152 centimetres, your maximum of 1,42 is approximately 10 centimetres, well precisely 10 centimetres out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line705"><a name="pos705"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> You're right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line706"><a name="pos706"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And on the lower level, your minimum of 1,35 would be approximately 17 centimetres out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line707"><a name="pos707"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> Right.  But you'd ignore the lower level ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line708"><a name="pos708"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright, well let's ignore the lower level, let's talk about the 10 centimetres.  ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line709"><a name="pos709"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, can I just ask this?  Why do we ignore the lower level?  Just so we understand it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line710"><a name="pos710"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> Well because when you're looking at the deviation from normal, you look at simply the difference from the - if you - it's simply this, if you're standing outside a room you say you're standing, if you're standing one metre away from the room, you're standing one metres away from the nearest wall, not the other wall on the other side.  You understand what I'm saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line711"><a name="pos711"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line712"><a name="pos712"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> Very briefly.  You know, I'll just reiterate that this doesn't - it's very, very difficult to say that it amounts to an exclusion, it's simply a matter of confidence in what we accept.</p>
<p class="line" id="line713"><a name="pos713"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, alright ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line714"><a name="pos714"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> I would say also that 20 centimetres difference was a lot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line715"><a name="pos715"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line716"><a name="pos716"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> 10 centimetres difference is half of 20, it's not that much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line717"><a name="pos717"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well it's half of it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line718"><a name="pos718"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> It's - you know, it's all one can say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line719"><a name="pos719"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well Doctor, ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line720"><a name="pos720"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> If I may deviate slightly, the figure you're giving me, you're giving me a figure of 1,52 for me to answer with, even the 1,52 is an assumed figure, is it not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line721"><a name="pos721"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You don't have to worry about the evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line722"><a name="pos722"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> Okay, right so ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line723"><a name="pos723"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just one more question, a general question.  Would the age of the bones have any significance at all?  In other words, if you've got a skeleton that was three months old and one that was thirty years old, or whatever, would the age of the bones make a difference in the application of Lundi's formula in the measurements, etcetera?</p>
<p class="line" id="line724"><a name="pos724"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> Not much.  There's said to be shrinkage due to heating of bones.  If they were baked they may shrink somewhat, but if it's not heat, changes of heat, it shouldn't really make a difference.</p>
<p class="line" id="line725"><a name="pos725"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It wouldn't have a significant affect at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line726"><a name="pos726"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> That's right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line727"><a name="pos727"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line728"><a name="pos728"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line729"><a name="pos729"></a>	I'm not going to ask you too many questions because I'd like to speak to somebody about your evidence, Doctor Naidoo, but can I just put it to you that even on the 1,52, the probabilities of Mrs Kubheka being the person to whom that skeleton that you examined belonged, must be very low.  On your formula, because otherwise, what does your formula mean?  What does it help?</p>
<p class="line" id="line730"><a name="pos730"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> It's a guide.</p>
<p class="line" id="line731"><a name="pos731"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, well ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line732"><a name="pos732"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> A guide.  What's it's pointing is pointing to a considerably short individual.  And for that reason I simply - the conclusion from that stature calculation was that it points to a considerably short individual.  That is all really that one can actually say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line733"><a name="pos733"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line734"><a name="pos734"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> If you try and say ...(indistinct) it's based upon that interval that I get and you're looking at now probabilities of exclusion based upon the distance away from that range, I think you are taking this to ...  I think this inquiry is taking this to an extreme that would be scientifically inappropriate.  What I'm saying is - I'm coming back to this, I'm watering this down - not watering this down, I'm reading this back to what does stature estimation actually mean?</p>
<p class="line" id="line735"><a name="pos735"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, I was just going to ask you that.</p>

<p class="line" id="line739"><a name="pos739"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And within what parameters is it a guide and when is it no guide no longer?  I mean how far do you have to go for this Lundi's formula to have any meaning for a Court of Law or for a Commission of Inquiry?</p>
<p class="line" id="line740"><a name="pos740"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> I'm not too sure if I understand the question.</p>

<p class="line" id="line742"><a name="pos742"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> Yes, yes, and that's all, that's all it is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line743"><a name="pos743"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Within what parameters is it a guide?</p>
<p class="line" id="line744"><a name="pos744"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> Within - well what I'm saying is, the interval that I give gives you an idea as to the general height of that person.  That's all the guide tells you.</p>

<p class="line" id="line758"><a name="pos758"></a>	If on your formula you say a person between the range of 1,35 to 1,42 is a considerably short person, what would you say to a person with a height of 1,5?  Would that change your conclusion as to the shortness and the tallness of the person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line759"><a name="pos759"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> Sorry, it's not an easy question to ask.  We've got ask then what is the average height of a black female?  And the average would be - I'm not too sure, maybe an anatomist will help us, and anything that's above the average or significantly above would be tall and anything significantly below that will be short.  All I can say is that the height that I calculated almost certainly falls into the shorter range than normal.  If for example, 1,55 is considered to be an average, then 1,50 will be slightly shorter than average.</p>

<p class="line" id="line774"><a name="pos774"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, the equivalent group.</p>

<p class="line" id="line785"><a name="pos785"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes obviously if you can't find it, you can't find it.  We're not ordering you to supply the figures, it's only if you can do so.  If you could find them, we'd appreciate that.  Thank you.  Mr Thabethe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line786"><a name="pos786"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line787"><a name="pos787"></a>	Why I was asking you Doctor Naidoo, it's because in your conclusion after applying the Lundi's formula you say the figures do point to a considerably short individual, so I assumed the 1,35 to 1,42 metres in height.</p>
<p class="line" id="line788"><a name="pos788"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line789"><a name="pos789"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Now what I'm asking is, if a person was 1,5, would you still say the same thing or would it be different in terms of shortness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line790"><a name="pos790"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> I wouldn't - I don't think I would actually have made a statement 1,5 - I understand maybe perhaps your question now, 1,5, I would have made a finding of a considerably short individual.  If you look at my range, the medium point there is 1,38 and that is short by average standards of even laymen.  So - but 1,5 I certainly wouldn't, I don't think, sorry, I would have called that extremely short.  I  would have left it without a comment.</p>

<p class="line" id="line798"><a name="pos798"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Thanks, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line799"><a name="pos799"></a>	Doctor, based on what we now know, there's a probable height of somewhere in the region of 150, 152, thereabouts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line800"><a name="pos800"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line801"><a name="pos801"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And you have your mean of 1,38 within that parameters and then we have - and this is assuming that Dr Chetty did actually measure it at 1,6, now bearing in mind the scope of that difference, is it still a rule-out to you?  Is it possible that there would have been such a huge fluctuation?  Could we be dealing with the same body, or is it absolutely improbable?</p>
<p class="line" id="line802"><a name="pos802"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> Can I give two answers not conflicting?  First of all, scientifically speaking you can't rule it out.  That's the scientific ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line803"><a name="pos803"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Scientifically speaking?</p>
<p class="line" id="line804"><a name="pos804"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> Yes.  Then non-scientifically speaking, we have so many speculations, no suppositions here ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line805"><a name="pos805"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Assumptions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line806"><a name="pos806"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> Assumptions, sorry.  ... that the figure you give me may be subject to the same kind of variables that we're looking at.  For example, if I say that - we make mistakes as well, now this is non-scientifically speaking, when we look at people standing next to ...(indistinct), I think I'm a little taller than you, I think I'm a little shorter than you, these are variables and it's all - this is observer error and there are many things that come into it.  Allowing for that as well, I think generally speaking you shouldn't be able to rule out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line807"><a name="pos807"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You see my - I'm putting this to you as an expert now, as a scientist, as someone experienced in this field of identification of deceased remains and in that context, bearing in mind all these fluctuations and variations and possibilities, are you still satisfied in your own mind that it is highly probable that the remains you saw and that you worked on, are those of Ntombi Kubheka?</p>
<p class="line" id="line808"><a name="pos808"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> Not based on stature alone ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line809"><a name="pos809"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> No, I'm saying based on the whole conspectus of factors that you've applied, but bearing in mind what we've now heard about the height.</p>
<p class="line" id="line810"><a name="pos810"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> Yes, I understand your question.  What I'd like to say is that the coincident correspondence of all those features that I'd found and then reinforced by the video superimposition photograph on the skull, tells me that we have a high likelihood of having got a positive match and that this is Ntombi Kubheka.  I have to still find a tangible deviation on issue that tells me I might, we might have made a mistake in this identification.</p>
<p class="line" id="line811"><a name="pos811"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, say that again, I didn't understand you.  You said you would still have to say that there is a tangible deviation...</p>
<p class="line" id="line812"><a name="pos812"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> Yes, an identifiable deviation as well that tells you there's something wrong and that we probably need to investigate further to look for a match.</p>
<p class="line" id="line813"><a name="pos813"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line814"><a name="pos814"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> So there is nothing that's a deviant, or that's out of - there's no feature that is out of that constellation of supporting features.</p>
<p class="line" id="line815"><a name="pos815"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So there's no feature that's a rule-out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line816"><a name="pos816"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> Yes, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line817"><a name="pos817"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> But within the conspectives of factors, what you call a constellation of indicators, there is something missing that would make you want to look further?</p>
<p class="line" id="line818"><a name="pos818"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> No, nothing missing.  There is no finding ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line819"><a name="pos819"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Are you saying - put it another way, we spoke yesterday about positive, you can't make a positive finding on what you have here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line820"><a name="pos820"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> Yes, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line821"><a name="pos821"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> But what is within the realms of what lawyers call probability as opposed to possibility, which is lesser than probability, what are we talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line822"><a name="pos822"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> What I'm simply saying is that you've got a lot of features, age, sex, race, stature, etcetera, ...(indistinct) dental age and cranifacial identification, that they support the speculative identification for the alleged person.  There is no feature that does not support it, there's no non-corresponding feature.  For want of a better word ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line823"><a name="pos823"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> What do you mean "speculative identification"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line824"><a name="pos824"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> Okay.  The putative identification of this woman is that of Ntombi Kubheka.</p>
<p class="line" id="line825"><a name="pos825"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So all you mean is that it's a work in progress towards identification?</p>
<p class="line" id="line826"><a name="pos826"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> That's right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line827"><a name="pos827"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Have I understood that right?  Is that the sense that you mean speculative?</p>
<p class="line" id="line828"><a name="pos828"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> Well the alleged person, the alleged person Ntombi Kubheka, that's what's given to us, and now my role was to determine if there's a match and all the features that I found do match that of the alleged deceased, Ntombi Kubheka.  And besides the medical aspects, age, race, sex, stature, there are the issue of clothing, which I don't want to go into, but then of course cranifacial identification.  All these aspects do match those of the deceased, alleged deceased.</p>
<p class="line" id="line829"><a name="pos829"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line830"><a name="pos830"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> Nothing, there's nothing that I've found or nothing that was found by others whom I sent things to test for, that amounted to a non-match or a clear non-correspondence that would amount to a different person completely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line831"><a name="pos831"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Right.  I'm asking you about one other factor which you can tell me whether it's scientifically valid or not, but as a lay person looking at the other family members, would that amount, in your experience as a scientist, to an additional factor that might further corroborate the identity here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line832"><a name="pos832"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> Yes, yes, simply on the matter of height.  My findings, an independent finding was that this is a short individual.  And for that matter, it does - simply on the height alone there is a genetic tendency in this family to be short, at least this particular generation of siblings to be short and that does a match, that's match.</p>
<p class="line" id="line833"><a name="pos833"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Thank you, Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line834"><a name="pos834"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Advocate Bosman, do you have any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line835"><a name="pos835"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> I don't have any.</p>
<p class="line" id="line836"><a name="pos836"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are there any questions arising out of questions that have been put by the Panel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line837"><a name="pos837"></a><span class="speaker">FURTHER CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR VISSER:</span> Unfortunately, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line838"><a name="pos838"></a>	Can you just tell us, Lundi's Formula, does that apply without discrimination to all race groups in the world?</p>
<p class="line" id="line839"><a name="pos839"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> No, Lundi's got two formulas, one's for South African black males and the other one is for South African black females.  Similarly I think you mentioned Trott ...(indistinct) formula.</p>
<p class="line" id="line840"><a name="pos840"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line841"><a name="pos841"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> These formulas are based on similar formulas applied to the American males, American females, American white males, American white females and American black males and American black females.  So I understand that Lundi devised in similar fashion, the mathematical formula for the South African blacks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line842"><a name="pos842"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  Lastly, I read to Prof Vanezis a paragraph from "An Introduction to Forensic Sciences", the paper and Iskan and Loth and in regard to the last question put by Mr Lax, I just want to read to you this at page 346 of Exhibit O.  The last paragraph says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line843"><a name="pos843"></a>"All skeletal assessments begin with what Kroggman referred to as the "Big Four", age, sex, race and stature."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line844"><a name="pos844"></a>Have you got it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line845"><a name="pos845"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> Sorry, which page was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line846"><a name="pos846"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Page 346 of Exhibit O.  Whereabout on the page? Can you indicate the portion, top or bottom?  Towards the bottom.</p>
<p class="line" id="line847"><a name="pos847"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> It's on the page opposite where you will see a drawing of a skeleton.  Have you got it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line848"><a name="pos848"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> Yes, yes I have.</p>
<p class="line" id="line849"><a name="pos849"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I continue.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line850"><a name="pos850"></a>"Each characteristic narrows the pool of possible matches considerably, sex alone cuts it by half.  If a skeleton is complete and undamaged, these attributes can be assessed with great accuracy.  Using the latest techniques, sex can be determined with certainty.  Age estimated, to within about five years and stature approximated with a standard deviation of about 1,5 inches, 3,5 centimetres."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line851"><a name="pos851"></a>Would you agree with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line852"><a name="pos852"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> Are you asking me to agree with those figures?</p>
<p class="line" id="line853"><a name="pos853"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I'm asking whether you can agree with that, or do agree with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line854"><a name="pos854"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> I haven't looked at - what I would have to do is look at his references.</p>
<p class="line" id="line855"><a name="pos855"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line856"><a name="pos856"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> You see, because if he found - if we find that this book deals with references or refers to work that was done very much more recent, more recent work that gives you more data, then that would be fine, then that would be an advance.  This is a scientific advance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line857"><a name="pos857"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Can I then ask you the question I asked you before, and this is going to be my last question.  Can you point at any factor, characteristic, ideosyncracy, call it what you like, in a body which, or the skeleton which you examined, that is such an individualistic factor that you could say this was the body of Ntombi Kubheka?</p>
<p class="line" id="line858"><a name="pos858"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> Are you referring to my experience?</p>
<p class="line" id="line859"><a name="pos859"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> This particular post-mortem that you did on number 1155.</p>
<p class="line" id="line860"><a name="pos860"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> No, there is no particular and unique criterion that I have identified, that would tell us that it's definitely her.  There was no positive.</p>
<p class="line" id="line861"><a name="pos861"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you, Doctor.  I have no further questions, Chairperson.</p>

<p class="line" id="line863"><a name="pos863"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Any further questions arising out of questions that have been put by the Panel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line864"><a name="pos864"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR SAMUEL:</span> Doctor, you have seen the post-mortem report by Dr Chetty, that's PM580.</p>
<p class="line" id="line865"><a name="pos865"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line866"><a name="pos866"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUEL:</span> Alright.  And you received some remains where you were asked to do a post-mortem.</p>
<p class="line" id="line867"><a name="pos867"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line868"><a name="pos868"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUEL:</span> Alright.  Was there any doubt in your mind that you did not receive the correct remains, that the remains that you had after you did the post-mortem, was that it did not belong to PM580?</p>
<p class="line" id="line869"><a name="pos869"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> No, it gave me no reason to doubt that whatsoever.</p>
<p class="line" id="line870"><a name="pos870"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUEL:</span> I see.  For all intents and purposes then, in your mind, the post-mortem that was conducted by Dr Chetty, related to the remains that you conducted ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line871"><a name="pos871"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> Yes, it was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line872"><a name="pos872"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUEL:</span> Despite the height differences?</p>
<p class="line" id="line873"><a name="pos873"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> At the time of my post-mortem examination I don't think I had sight, I don't believe I had sight of Dr Chetty's original report.</p>
<p class="line" id="line874"><a name="pos874"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUEL:</span> But now that you've seen the report and you notice the height difference, is there any doubt in your mind?</p>
<p class="line" id="line875"><a name="pos875"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> No, there still doesn't appear to be good reason to believe that it might have been a different body.</p>
<p class="line" id="line876"><a name="pos876"></a><span class="speaker">MR SAMUEL:</span> Thank you.  Thank you, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line877"><a name="pos877"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR SAMUEL</p>
<p class="line" id="line878"><a name="pos878"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Just one thing arising, Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line879"><a name="pos879"></a>	It's been put to you that Dr Chetty performed a post-mortem, do you think he performed a post-mortem, as you would have performed a post-mortem?</p>
<p class="line" id="line880"><a name="pos880"></a><span class="speaker">DR NAIDOO:</span> Yes you know, with due respect to a colleague, and I must express this because I have been asked, I don't believe that was post-mortem examination.  If that amounts to a post-mortem examination, then it's a post-mortem inspection, not a post-mortem examination.  If it can be at all an inspection.</p>
<p class="line" id="line881"><a name="pos881"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  No further questions?  Doctor Naidoo, thank you, that concludes your testimony, subject to what we said yesterday.  And I'd also like to thank you for coming without any prior notice, so promptly.  Thank you.</p>

<p class="line" id="line884"><a name="pos884"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is there anymore evidence to be led at this stage?  Oh yes, sorry, we have here I see placed before us, a statement by Insp Andrew Attie Moolan, what is the status of this?  Is this ...  Does everybody have a copy of this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line885"><a name="pos885"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Yes, I did not wish to call him as a witness, but I wanted to place this on record.</p>
<p class="line" id="line886"><a name="pos886"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Before we read it, is everyone in agreement that we should read it, that's going to be properly before us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line887"><a name="pos887"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Chairperson, I'll go further than that, we have no objection to you accepting this as evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line888"><a name="pos888"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Could you just give an indication please, Ms Thabethe, as to when the statement was made?  I see it's for your attention, so I presume it's a recent statement, not one that was pulled out of a 1997 file.</p>
<p class="line" id="line889"><a name="pos889"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> I actually phoned him today and I asked him to go to the file and give us a report.  Ja, it's just a brief statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line890"><a name="pos890"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Because it's undated, so it would be dated about yesterday or today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line891"><a name="pos891"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Today.</p>
<p class="line" id="line892"><a name="pos892"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can I write that on there.   Would that be Exhibit T?  We'll call it Exhibit T, just so that it's got a place on the record.  This is the statement of Insp Attie Moolan.  Is there any other evidence today then?  No further evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line893"><a name="pos893"></a>	Mr Wills, we listened to what you said yesterday concerning what Mr Visser said about wanting an opportunity to consult his own experts, and we believe that we shouldn't deny that.  But Mr Visser, you realise ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line894"><a name="pos894"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Ms Thabethe, this document refers to an exhumation by Dr Naidoo of Durban, not by Dr Aiyer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line895"><a name="pos895"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> I can follow it up, because telephonically I spoke about Dr Aiyer, so ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line896"><a name="pos896"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> This doesn't talk about Dr Aiyer, that's why.</p>
<p class="line" id="line897"><a name="pos897"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> I can follow it up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line898"><a name="pos898"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Mr Visser, you realise that we're now getting towards the end of the process and we'd have to have some sort of terms put down.  You know if you could let us know by, what, 15th of August, two weeks, would that be sufficient?</p>
<p class="line" id="line899"><a name="pos899"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Chairperson, there's only one matter which is outstanding before we can talk to Dr Loth, and that is to obtain a copy of the video transmission.  Once we ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line900"><a name="pos900"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You mean the video transmission ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line901"><a name="pos901"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Of Tuesday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line902"><a name="pos902"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  I don't know how long that will take ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line903"><a name="pos903"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> We've asked for one.  We haven't received a confirmation as to when we'll get it, but the moment we have that, within a day or two we would be able to ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line904"><a name="pos904"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, well I will keep on this aspect about getting a copy of that transmission.  I was informed, I might say informally, by the Sound Engineer, that a portion was lost, 34 seconds I think, was lost because somebody stood on a cable or something, but apparently, I don't know exactly which portion, but it doesn't have the effect of nullifying anything or ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line905"><a name="pos905"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> It really dealt with the - as I understand from him, the skull reconstruction evidence, which Prof Venezis said wasn't what he used for the purposes of   ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line906"><a name="pos906"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay, about building up the plasticine and that clay ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line907"><a name="pos907"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, that's as I understand it, but we'll obviously have to ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line908"><a name="pos908"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But that is missing and I suppose if anything vital is missing, we could have a reconstruction from notes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line909"><a name="pos909"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  Chairperson, there's just one last matter, we still have not obtained the last photograph, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line910"><a name="pos910"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Oh that full front photograph that was blown up, Ms Thabethe, from the passport.  Mr Wills mentioned a pile of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line911"><a name="pos911"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes, I saw them downstairs where the photocopier is, Mr Chairperson, so they must ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line912"><a name="pos912"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> They must be around somewhere.</p>
<p class="line" id="line913"><a name="pos913"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> I haven't seen it, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line914"><a name="pos914"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, if we can have a copy of that before we leave, please.   And if we could have a copy.  That was Figure 30, was it, I think Mr Wills?</p>
<p class="line" id="line915"><a name="pos915"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> ;  R30.</p>
<p class="line" id="line916"><a name="pos916"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> R30.   Yes, so Mr Visser, then I'll do what I can to get that video transcript across to you and then if we could try to work to a deadline, depending on that, of the 15th of August, and then if you could let us know what you wish to do, whether you wish to recall anybody or lead any evidence in this regard or not, and then we'll have to make arrangements from there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line917"><a name="pos917"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> We are hoping that we need not come back and ask for you to hear evidence, but what we'll probably have to do at the least, would be to draw a report to present to the other interested parties, for them to react to it before that decision can finally be made.</p>
<p class="line" id="line918"><a name="pos918"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, if there's no further evidence.  And there would be the question of argument, and I think perhaps in the circumstances, and from what I've heard from legal representatives, that written Heads will be prepared and then if any of the legal representatives, and if it's at all possible, wishes to have a short hearing to stress certain points that they desire, then hopefully that would be arranged, but that hearing wouldn't last more than a day.  It might be in a place like Pretoria or something like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line919"><a name="pos919"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> We would certainly not think that it is necessary to have another hearing, because frankly, to do justice to an argument in this case is not going to finish in a day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line920"><a name="pos920"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  No, but I mean after receiving written Heads.</p>
<p class="line" id="line921"><a name="pos921"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line922"><a name="pos922"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why I say it - if it's possible, I don't know if it's possible, but we can try for that if people want it, that they've done Heads and they might want to drive a couple of points home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line923"><a name="pos923"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Mr Chairperson, my instructions from the family are that for the purposes of concluding this hearing, it would preferable to have a day or argument, so we will be requesting that.  We will supply Heads and then we will request to address them verbally.</p>
<p class="line" id="line924"><a name="pos924"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And we can have that at a convenient time.  We will try to arrange that.  But I think the first step then, it's a little bit unusual, the first step would be to wait to see whether there's going to be further evidence or not.  Mr Visser says there may well not be, but there might be some sort of written report for comments, which would obviously have to be taken into consideration for the Heads, and then we'd have to, because we're coming to the end of the process, have some sort of turn as when Heads should be in.  It's difficult to say that now, because we don't know when the next stage is going to be completed.  But I would urge the legal representatives to start preparing their Heads, I mean there's a lot that can be done without whatever scientific evidence may come.  I'm sure that the bulk of the Heads could be done and can be added on after that further information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line925"><a name="pos925"></a>	Mr Lax, you were pointing out to this latest exhibit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line926"><a name="pos926"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Yes, Chair, I was just going to say that when I read the SAP180, it's clear from that that the remains were handed to Dr Aiyer and not Dr Naidoo, so ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line927"><a name="pos927"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So it's clearly just an error in the first, when reference is made to Dr Naidoo.  Yes, well that then brings us to the conclusion of this hearing and I would like to thank everybody who made these hearings here possible, from the Interpreters who worked long and hard, to the Security personnel, despite the fact that we had a laptop computer stolen from our room, but it's not their fault.  The caterers, the Sound Engineers particularly, for having to break down and set up for the video transmission, which was a new experience, and to everybody concerned, Secretaries, Logistic Officers, thank you very much. 	We'll now adjourn, thank you.</p>
