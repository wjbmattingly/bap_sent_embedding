<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> ... attend the hearings because of some problem with the State attorney.  His instructions were therefore not to appear and therefore Mr Baker would also not be appearing at these proceedings.  He regretted ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Because we did in fact lose some time because of that, but thank you for placing that on record.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALL:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  I represent three of the victims of the Chamberlain Road explosion.  One of my clients has raised a concern this morning and has asked me to put it down on record and to place it on record, when he arrived at the centre, there were a number of very heavily armed people who are the bodyguards or security personnel for some of the applicants.  These people were carrying heavy calibre firearms and weapons.  My client, and I were not here last week, we understand that there was some type of arrangement or agreement that was reached between the Commission and the applicants regarding protection and bodyguards and for the sake of my clients who were not here, we would like the Commission basically, if possible, to clear up what the position is with regards the use of firearms in and around the vicinity of the building.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Mall.  I am aware that when this hearing proceeded, that certain arrangements were made.  We will take a look into the matter and keep in touch with you and the other applicants in this respect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALL:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When we adjourned yesterday, I mentioned that I at the start of the proceedings now, will make a ruling relating to the Section 29 proceedings.  Like the previous ruling we made, the full reasons will be contained in our decision in the matter at the end of the hearing, but the ruling after having considered the submissions, we arrived at the following unanimous ruling and that is as follows - it is ruled that the document marked Exhibit C which is a transcript of the proceedings of an enquiry held in terms of Section 29 of Act 34 of 1995, concerning the fifth applicant, that is Mr Robert McBride, which was held at Durban on the 21st of April 1997, is admissible as evidence in respect of the fifth applicant's application only and may accordingly be used for purposes of cross-examining the fifth applicant at this hearing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> As the Chair pleases.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> As the Chair pleases.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> As the Chair pleases.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Dehal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.   Mr Chairperson, I would have Mr McBride now testify.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you.  Just before we proceed, I just remind the people that these proceedings will be simultaneously translated and if you wish to benefit from the translation, please obtain one of these devices from the sound technician.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:</span> (affirmed)</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Mr Dehal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR DEHAL:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.  Mr McBride, may I show you A1, you have that on the left of you, that is the bundle A1.  If you would look at pages 103 to 112, do you confirm that that is your application for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> Yes, that is my amnesty application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Is it correct that in  categorising the matters, you deal firstly with the acts as contained in your trial record and the charges therein contained?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> I show you page 104 of bundle A1.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> I have that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Do you see that at the bottom under paragraph 9(a), you have (iv) and then on the next page, page 105, (c), (d), (e) and on the following page, 106, (f), (g) and (h), correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> Yes, I have that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Would those be acts for which, in regard to which you were not charged and not convicted, but acts that you are now talking freely of?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> And then in paragraph 9(b) on page 106, continuing over onto page 107, is it correct that you deal with three incidents relative to the deaths resulting, sorry injuries and deaths resulting from the above and here you deal firstly with the Klein household, secondly with the Edendale aspect and thirdly with the Why Not bar operation, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Mr McBride ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> Mr Dehal, just to avoid any confusion, what is the position about acts for which he was not charged or convicted, does he make application for that as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> He does indeed in the interest of full disclosure.  Thank you Judge.  Mr McBride, is it correct that you have prepared a statement of your own, which you want to begin by reading out.  I show you this brief statement, Mr Chairperson, I have copies for all persons.  May I cause them to be distributed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Dehal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Mr McBride, I hand this statement to you.  Perhaps before you begin reading it, would you mind if I just arrange for these copies to be handed over.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Dehal, we can mark it Exhibit F.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> As it pleases you, Mr Chairperson.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> Sorry, we will just wait for everybody to have their copies.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> I think everybody has their copies.  Mr McBride, you may begin reading your statement.  If I may just say to you, perhaps you should leave ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> Mr Dehal, could you just help me.  The indictment referred to in paragraph 9(a)(i), I don't recall having seen that, where would I find that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Judge, thank you for pointing that out to me.  Unfortunately I didn't anticipate that as being a problem.  I will arrange for copies to be made of that indictment.   I think it is a good point, it will be necessary and wise for us all to have copies of it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is it not contained in bundle A2?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> May I just look Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> There is an indictment on pages 1 through to 33, that is in the case of Mr McBride and one Antonio du Preez?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> That appears to be so Mr Chairperson, and then what follows is the summary of substantial facts relating to that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, then there is a further indictment also on pages in the other volume, 1 to 63 in the case of S v ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Antonio du Preez and Derrick McBride?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No,   No, Robert John McBride and Greta Margaret Apelgren.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Sorry Mr Chairperson, I don't follow.  I think that is the only indictment relating to Robert and Greta.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> McBride and Apelgren, that would be pages 1 to page 63 and on bundle A2, under paragraph 3 of the index, you will see reference to the indictment relating to S v Antonio du Preez and Derrick McBride.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, sorry, that is my mistake.  It is pages 1 to 63?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That is the indictment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Thank you, I confirm that that is the indictment.  Thank you.   Mr McBride, if I may take you to your statement, now marked Exhibit F, when reading the statement will you please pause wherever you wish to add anything in addition to the typed print and simply indicate that so that the parties here present would be able to mark that and record what you are saying verbally, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you read it Mr McBride, if you can just bear in mind the Interpreters please, that they've got to simultaneously interpret.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> Before I read out my statement, I wish to state that I have already served a sentence for most of the activities detailed in the amnesty application, almost seven years, considerably longer than any apartheid Minister.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a>	Secondly, since 1987 when I was convicted and sentenced to death for activities on behalf of the ANC, MK, these activities have been in the public realm and there has been no further legal action initiated against me all this time.  I come before this Commission in the spirit of reconciliation, I live reconciliation every day in my life and for me, it is not just a buzz word.  I also wish to clean the slate and put the conflicts of the past, behind me, hence I have included relatively minor incidents such as the burning of Fairvale High School.  I have also included activities for which I was acquitted at the time of the trial.  I place my trust in this Committee that it would treat my case fairly.  Other than reconciliation, I have nothing to gain from applying for amnesty.  For my activities to liberate myself and my fellow oppressed South Africans from apartheid, I have been scorned and insulted by a small minority of South Africans, as well as by that section of the media which is white owned and controlled.   This hearing will also give them an opportunity, the last one, to learn the facts about me and my opposition to apartheid.  I now turn to my formal statement.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a>"I was born on the 6th of July 1963 as a second class South African citizen, an oppressed person.  I was born in a ghetto, a product of apartheid.  I received inferior education.  My rights as a citizen were denied to me for the benefit of a small minority.  I have experienced since childhood every possible form of racial insult.  The State classified me as coloured, a term I have always detested as it infers being lessened by my black South African blood.  As a result of this, I have developed political consciousness during my early years and I was involved in various non-violent activities directed against apartheid until 1984.  In 1984 I assisted a number of ANC members in the distribution of pamphlets and ANC literature.</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a>	However, I soon realised that the South African government and its surrogates, would not be persuaded to end racism through moral persuasion.   I accepted at this stage that violence was necessary.  The evidence for me of the correctness of this part was that before I was born ..."</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ... the?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> That is correct sir.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a>"... The ANC initiated a limited armed struggle hoping to persuade the racist government to change.  They did not change and throughout that period, continued to oppress black people.  This oppression increasingly included mass murder and cross-border massacres.  The government did this with ever increasing ...(indistinct) support from the white community.   My sense of anger, frustration and helplessness in the face of this injustice, came to an end when I was formally recruited to MK Special Ops.  For the first time in my life I was able to do something against the system.  For the first time in my life, I was regarded as a South African, full status, without racial categorisation.   This elevation in my status was for me the most empowering moment of my life.</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a>	For this I thank the ANC and all those in the movement, that I have had the honour to work with.  For this I will always remain loyal to the ANC.   When I joined Special Ops, I decided to give myself completely to the ANC.  I broke off my relationship with a woman I was in love with and with whom I was discussing marriage.  I also decided not to complete my final year of my Higher Diploma in Education for the sake of pursuing the struggle on a full-time 24-hour basis.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a>	I joined MK Special Ops in 1985.  I was recruited by Gordon Webster.   On recruitment I was told that I would be part of Special Ops.  It was emphasised that Special Ops was separate from the provincial machinery.  Our Overall Commander was Aboobaker Ismail or Rashid as we knew him, who reported directly to the NEC and in particular to the then President, Oliver Tambo.   </p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a>	On recruitment I was also told I would not be given medals or money for my work, and that in all likelihood I would be killed in action.   I would also participate in actions where people would be killed.  I was given two weeks in which to think about this and after two weeks, I accepted and became a full member of Special Operations.  I was 22 years old at this stage.   I was told that I must be true to the Organisation and its leadership and also told never to volunteer information to the enemy.   </p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a>	This in short was the understanding under which I formally joined the armed struggle against apartheid.  At the time I joined MK Special Ops, the ANC had more diplomatic missions abroad then the then South African government and was recognised as the most effective liberation movements against the apartheid regime.  The ANC was part of an internationally recognised and legitimate liberation movement.  I carried out all my operations under the auspices of the ANC and at all times, under the instructions of the ANC.  I did this to the best of my ability and with great risk to myself and my family.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a>	I have served almost seven years as I have said earlier, in prison for my activities on behalf of MK Special Ops and the ANC and four of these were on death row.  I was released as a political prisoner in September 1992 as a consequence of negotiations between the ANC and the National Party.  I have had no gain whatsoever in material terms form my contribution to the struggle to rid South Africa of racism.  On the contrary, I and my family lost everything that we have built up over many years of hard work.  For this I have no regrets, South Africa is free.  I am no longer a second class citizen and my children will never be classified in this way.  We now have one of the best constitutions and Bills of Rights in the world.  However, I am truly sorry that in my quest for this freedom, I have caused the deaths of other South Africans.   Of this I am not proud.   This is the tragedy of the civil war that South Africa experienced as a result of apartheid.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a>	I also cannot isolate the sadness I feel at those deaths, from the sadness I feel about the countless number of South Africans who died because the apartheid regime wanted to perpetuate itself.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a>	At this stage I want to turn to another matter.  I would like this Committee to help ascertain a list of precisely who Mr Richard represents as this was repeatedly requested of Mr Richard by your Committee and in as much as Mr Richard says he has the list, he has not yet produced it.  This list will assist me for purposes of reconciliation, to amongst other things, understand precisely who opposes my amnesty application and in regard to which count this relates.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a>	More importantly I would like to know before I begin to traverse the details of my application, as to whether the victims Mr Richard represents, still persist in the denial of all matters relative to my application for amnesty as Mr Richard indicated, or do they now, having had the benefit of Mr Ismail's testimony, admit any aspect.  This enquiry is important as I and my legal representative can then know precisely what I am not required to prove or not.  Thank you."</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr McBride.  Mr Richard concerning the list, I know that you did indicate previously that there was a list which certain names had been marked, etc, has that been finalised now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> I handed my list to the logistics person who is not in the corner at the moment.  I have not had the list back yet, but nothing has changed.  However, I don't seriously believe it is for the applicant to challenge my locus standi to present the victims.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I don't, well perhaps Mr McBride can correct me if I am wrong, I didn't understand that he is challenging the locus standi, I understood that he would like to know the list of the people who are opposing because as he mentions here, for purposes of reconciliation maybe, if we can make an endeavour to...</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> May I just confirm Mr Chairperson, that is the correct view.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> My instructions are not to give the list, I don't see on what basis Mr McBride can have the list at this stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> Mr Richard, I asked for the list and you promised to give it long ago.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> I did give the list.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> Well, you didn't give it to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> I gave it to the Logistics Officer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I see there is the Logistics Officer.  You needn't clarify, I don't think.  Perhaps we can sort this out during the tea break.  Just one point, Mr McBride, you are talking in your statement of what you have to, what you require to prove or not.  This is not really a question of proving like in a court case.  What is required here is for us to receive your evidence, and then to determine in terms of the criteria contained in the Act, whether what you have told us, suffices to make a decision on your applications in so far as the incidents in which you, for which you apply for amnesty.  The main criteria, and there are various other criteria which Mr Dehal knows is that whether your actions at all times in respect of each of the incidents, were performed in furtherance of a political objective, committed during the conflict of the past and secondly whether there has been a full disclosure in our view as to what role you played in respect of each of the incidents.   Whether a victim, any victim in any amnesty application is opposing or not opposing, does not really have a major impact in regard to the satisfaction by the applicant of those criteria contained in the Act.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> Thank you Honourable Chairperson, it is just that Mr Richard representing the victims had indicated nothing is admitted, that is I don't know at which point that begins and at which point it ends, whether I am a South African, whether I was born here, whether I am an ANC member, whether I worked for Special Ops.  I ask this because at some stage relatives or the family of the victims had indicated that they had information that I was not a member of the ANC.  It is on this basis that I am asking you know, where are the problems.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, well, Mr Richard isn't obliged to indicate exactly what is admitted and what is not.  As I said, it is not as if we are in some litigation in a court here, where all the matters have been put in issue that every single one has to be proved.  I mean the fact that - if you say that you are a South African citizen, we I can assure you as a Panel, don't expect you to now go and call somebody from the Department of Home Affairs and prove your birth certificate and that sort of stuff.  We will just listen to the evidence and make findings on that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Mr Chairman, may I assist.  At page 3 of bundle A1 the Evidence Analyst extracted a list of victims in respect of the Why Not bar, so from the Amnesty Committee's side, we have 74 names.  Unfortunately there are no addresses, but as a starting point, these have been gleaned from the various documents that the Commission had possession of, so possibly it could assist to some extent the applicant's enquiry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Prior.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> At this juncture Chairperson, with your leave, there is a procedural matter I would like to put on record.  As will appear from the record, since last week I have repeatedly been requesting access to the transcript of the trial record of the prosecution against Mr McBride.   While true it has been brought to this hearing, it is important to put on record that to date I have not been given those volumes which contain the indictments and the ancillary supporting documents, the admissions or the evidence of Mr McBride.  I still, when I received documents over the weekend, those volumes were missing.  I raised this point and it was not corrected.  It must be seen against the context that the strenuous opposition to Volume C, Exhibit C was a topic of argument yesterday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a>	During that argument mention was made of other documents referred to in Exhibit C, it seems as if there is only one consistent inference to be drawn from this refusal or failure to get the documents into my possession.  We know and I think it is now important to put it on record, that there are various contradictory and conflicting versions of various incidents contained in all three documents and I think that there is a constructive effort underway to prevent access to the contradicting documents so as to prevent cross-examination on them, but I will leave the point till later, I have put it on record, and I will deal with it in cross-examination.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, sorry, on that point Mr Prior, what is the position relating to the trial record and Mr Richard's concerns, why hasn't he received the relevant volumes.   I can answer the question, there is only one extant copy that we can locate and that is in Mr Dehal's possession.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Mr Chairman, yes, I may be able to assist.  In the preparation of this hearing, it was discovered that the Commission did not have a full copy of the record.  Strenuous efforts were made around the country to obtain such a record, even the appeal record was not, had been unbundled and - we then made enquiries from Mr Dehal at a very early stage and he indicated that he did have an archive of documents at the trial, but that he would also require, because they weren't specifically at his office, he had to also make time to go through them and satisfy which was reasonable in the circumstances, given the extent of time that had elapsed.  We did indicate in writing that any documentation to be used, we would welcome at an early stage, and I understand when we got into Durban, enquiries were made for access to the record.  I understood that Mr Richard and Mr Dehal were in contact with each other as was the case with other legal representatives, and because we did not have a pre-hearing, it was agreed that the legal representatives would be able to communicate formally with each other and obtain whatever documents, and I think at the beginning of the hearing it was also raised, and there was an indication from Mr Dehal as I recall, that he would make the relevant documentation available to Mr Richard, that we could at least, from the victims' side at least, that he could prepare himself on that evidence.  I cannot take the matter any further than that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Prior.  What is the position relating to the trial record, Mr Dehal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson, for raising it with me.  There appears to be a number of issues.  I want to begin at this level - I take ...(indistinct) negative aspersions on my professional calibre, attitude, etc.  I do not like it.  I think it must be addressed correctly, he started this - forgive me - irresponsible attitude and accusations towards me some time ago, and I think it must stop right here and now, I am fed up of it.  I must place on record quite correctly that I am the only person who would appear to have a record.  I told Mr Prior on the telephone when first I spoke to him and he enquired about the trial record, that I thought and I still know that copies of all the bundles are available at what is commonly termed death row, that is Maximum Security Prison.  I know that they are still there, he is the Evidence Leader.  I have a copy.  I managed to extract it from the archives late on Thursday, Friday was a holiday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a>	Mr Richard has said I have failed, I have refused, he has constantly asked, he has not had it, this is a lie.  He has had it.  I have given the document to Mr Paddy Prior, he was the custodian at the time.  A weekend passed, that was Friday last week or Thursday last week and then Mr Richard had it with him.  The following Monday he mentioned to me and I say this in his favour, that he had not had the time to read them all and I accept that.  There is no difficulty about that, but against the background of him having had all those two Volumes of photographs and all the Volumes in the transcript, he cannot now say he has never had it.  This weekend he has called me personally to deliver these documents to him.  That means the trial transcript.  I went out of my way as to drive from a place outside Verulam, some 42 kilometres away and deliver it to him at the place he is presently resident.  I agree I did not give him all the Volumes, but that is principally because I am leading Mr McBride, I had to prepare.  Now I have been disadvantaged by giving him my Volumes, he is not the person who has to have all the Volumes all the time, I am also a legal representative in this matter and I have a duty to Mr McBride and I am endeavouring as best I can, to deliver that duty.  I am being prejudiced, Mr McBride is being prejudiced by me delivering those to him.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a>	Yesterday he phones me just as I begin my consultation to say now these are the Volumes I have and these are the Volumes I don't have, when are you delivering them to me and I was equally fed up with that, and I told him that I am being prejudiced by not having some Volumes, I need what you had and seriously you need what I have.  Can we not approach Mr Prior and make some copies of these and let's put to rest this whole issue about whether I ought to deliver them to you or not.  I am trying as best I can, I am not the Evidence Leader.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, I can see the difficulty of having only one record which is required by more than one party.   I must say to me it is surprising that there is only one record available, one would have thought that there would be various records, it is I take it fairly voluminous Mr Dehal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Mr Chairperson, there are 15 Volumes and may I just say whilst it is fresh in my head, the inference that we are specifically refusing or failing to give to Mr Richard these Volumes containing Mr McBride's evidence so that he could not cross-examine etc, and find contradictions, is false.  He has had them.   I will make them available again as soon as I am over with Mr McBride.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  Mr Prior, this trial, was it held in Durban in the then Supreme Court?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Mr Chairman, yes.  Mr Chairman ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is there not any ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Mr Chairman, the enquiries made by the Investigating Unit of the Amnesty Committee as well as the Evidence Analyst and myself, we were unable to obtain any copy, full copy of the record at the Durban archives, the Durban court.  We were informed that the Maximum Prison had a copy, we made enquiries there, we never got it.   Short of personally going to the prison which I understood an Investigator did, I cannot explain why there wasn't a copy given.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So at this stage we are stuck with just one copy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> We are stuck with Mr Dehal's copy which miraculously survived after all the years.  May I simply say that the court records were destroyed after I think four or five years.  They don't keep records beyond five years.  We also tried to track down from the Indemnity Committee in Pretoria, and we came out blank.  We were also informed that Gen Staedtler may have had a full copy of the record when he wrote his book, that also drew a blank.  So a number of enquiries were made, all drew a blank.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I am satisfied from what you have told me that steps have been taken to get a copy, unsuccessfully.  Mr Richard, from what I have heard, it would seem that there is a difficulty.  I certainly wouldn't express the view that there has been a deliberate sabotaging of your preparation in this matter.   I think we've got to be tolerant here, it might have unfortunately cost us more time in the future, but if we can make some sort of arrangement that this Volume, this one copy of the various Volumes be shared.  There is nothing else that we seem to be able to do, maybe copies can be made, depending - of certain parts of it.  I don't think there will be sufficient time to make copies of all 15 Volumes, but of the very important aspects which I am sure you might be able to identify and Mr Dehal might, we can make copies of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Another inference which is also apparent is that we are both pursuing the same Volumes at the same time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> But as I have said earlier, I put it on record, I haven't yet read certain segments of the record.  I have done my best with the time available, but I will go through the others.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We understand the difficulty and we are not going to come hard down on anybody if somebody requires a bit of time to read some documentation, then so be it.  It will have to be done because of the circumstances.  There cannot be any blame apportioned to anybody.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Thank you Chairperson.  I suggest we proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Mr Chairperson, just two aspects incidental to the issue.  The first is for the correction of the record, we did have a meeting, Mr Prior I think repeats that we did not have a pre-trial meeting, no, but in as much as we did not have a pre-trial meeting for good reasons.  We had a meeting which was held upstairs in these premises.  Mr Berger was present, his Instructing Attorney and all of us and at that meeting we discussed Volume A1 and Mr Richard did not at that stage say I want the trial record for he had it at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, we know there is a difficulty and let's hope that we can just sort it out and share the record.  If there is any difficulties from anybody, if you could please just revert to us and we can see if we can smooth them over and let's get this done in the best way and the smoothest way, possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> I agree Mr Chairperson.  Mr Chairperson, the second thing that I want to raise is Mr McBride raised the question of this list, I did not hear what the lady who came in, said.  I had my headphones on.  I don't know whether the question of that list has been appropriately addressed.  Sorry, Mr McBride is aware of pages 3 and 4 and the list of those persons. As I have mentioned earlier, we take issue with that list because it differs in number and names from the earlier list, but the basis for the request is to establish who in fact is opposing as opposed to the full list.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, Mr Richard has handed a list over to the Logistics Officer who stated that in her view, she's got difficulty in compiling I take it, it was handed to her to compile a list of those persons being represented.  What I would suggest is that perhaps during the tea time, if she can come and see me and I will identify exactly what those problems are and how extensive they are and we will make all effort to get that list out, because we as a Panel, would also like to know that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.  I think if that list pursuant to Judge Pillay's request is handed in, then that becomes a part of the record and Mr McBride would like to see it.  Mr Chairperson, I see it is five past eleven or thereabouts, should we take the short recess at this stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, this might be a convenient time.  We will take a short tea adjournment and we will recommence at half past eleven.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:</span> (affirmed)</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Chair, before we commence, Mr Dehal and I started talking over the tea adjournment.  Where we got to, results in this - any implication or inference that there was anything more sinister than us both needing the same Volume at the same time, is withdrawn and I apologise for casting any aspersion or suggesting that anything else could be inferred.   May I ask Mr Dehal whether that satisfies?</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Mr Chair, he has tendered this to me, it is now on record, I accept that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you gentlemen, I am pleased that that has been ironed out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> The second point is as yet unfinalised, the discussions had broken off because of other events, we were discussing lists, numbers and all the rest.  We will pursue that over lunch which is as I see it, not far away and I think let's proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, I did have a word with the Logistics Officer and my Secretary about the list and also, I can just put on record that we did discuss the question that was raised earlier this morning, relating to security which will also be addressed by the legal representatives and others at lunch time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Thank you Chair, nothing further at this point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Dehal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR DEHAL:</span> (cont)</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a>	Thank you Mr Chairperson, may I proceed with Mr McBride's evidence.  Mr McBride, you have been through Annexure F.  I now hand to you a more detailed statement which you have formulated and I hand copies to the respective parties present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We will call this statement Exhibit G.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.   Mr Chairperson, may I just refer to Exhibit G and place the following on record, it is a document that was hastily finalised late last night into the early hours of this morning and caused to be typed within the short time available this morning, so it may well have some spelling errors and typographical errors, I apologise if there are same.  I see that page 11 is duplicated in as much as the contents are not the same, so what I have done is caused one page to remain as page 11, with the number thereof at the bottom, and the next page to be numbered 11(a), if you don't mind.  I apologise for that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you Mr Dehal, and we will not be too critical about spellings and obvious typing errors.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> I am indebted to you, thank you.  Mr McBride you now have Exhibit G before you, perhaps if you can have the microphone on.  May I just begin by asking you to look at A1, pages 6 to 9, sorry 6 to 10.  Do you see the list of incidents as it is called on page 6, recorded thereunder enumerated 1 to 21 ending on page 10?</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> Yes, I have that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> And is it correct that Exhibit G seeks to address each of those acts, operations in the order in which it is found on pages 6 to 10?</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> Yes, to the best of my knowledge, this is all the operations I have been involved in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> And of course in Exhibit G, you address the operations that relate to you for example incident 1, 2 on page 6 and indeed item 3 does not relate to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> That is correct yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> And the first operation that you were involved in, would be loosely the Fairvale Senior Secondary School, arson attack, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> That is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Now, let's begin with Exhibit G.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> I just want to add on Exhibit G, the first incident, Fairvale Senior Secondary School, arson attack, was not part of Special Ops operations, it was before I was formally recruited into Special Operations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Thank you.  I take it that the content of Exhibit G relative to this count, deals with that aspect?</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Thank you.  Now Mr McBride, I don't know whether you want to read the document, Exhibit G, perhaps you should and wherever you wish to add things, again as indicated previously, if you could please just stop and indicate that you are now adding aspects additional to things typed within Exhibit G.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> Thank you, I prefer to read it in total.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry Mr McBride, just before you proceed, was your recruitment into MK simultaneous with your recruitment into Special Ops?  When you say that you were not a member of Special Ops at the time of the commission of this, were you a member of MK at that stage, or was it prior to that as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> I was a - I assisted an MK unit in the distribution of pamphlets.  They did not issue directives in regard to this.  This unit was formed in response to instructions given by the ANC to the general public of South Africa who regarded themselves as patriots.</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Thank you.  Mr McBride, if you will then look at Exhibit G on paragraph 1, is it correct that you now deal in paragraph 1 with the Fairvale Senior Secondary School, arson attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> And this incident is dealt with just for the purposes of cross-reference in your amnesty application, on page 106 of bundle A1, paragraph (g)?</p>

At the time of this operation, I was not formally recruited by Gordon Webster, however I was actively engaged in assisting and working with an ANC MK unit in Wentworth, the area I lived in since 1984.   I understood the ANC as having then issued instructions to all people who regarded themselves as patriots.  Such instructions were amongst others to carry out acts of political or revolutionary violence.  In consequence various persons, including myself in Wentworth, formed our own combat unit.   </p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a>	The first operation (and I should add in here the last one, there wasn't any other that I was involved in according to my recollection) was the arson attack on the Fairvale School.  I say this because shortly thereafter I was recruited by Gordon Webster.  By coincidence within the matter of a week or so, after then.   The object was in the main to highlight the inferior and dilapidated condition of the school, a complaint that we had tirelessly taken up till then.  We hoped that this long standing issue would now be addressed.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a>	My own activity in the operation was that I poured petrol into the school and threw a match in which caused the petrol to ignite and thus caused the arson.

Comrade Gordon Webster and Naziem Cassim were to have carried out this operation, but as a result of Naziem Cassim having not arrived, comrade Gordon Webster called on me in the last minute to come in and assist him in the operation.   I got to the substation with comrade Gordon Webster, and on his instructions, cut a hole in the fence and both of us entered the inner premises of the substation.   A ladder was also used.

In as much as I did not know what the purpose thereof was at the time, in retrospect it is clear that they were carrying out their reconnaissance mission in the substation."</p>

Comrade Gordon Webster and I decided to carry out the sabotage at Chamberlain Road substation.

<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> What I can only add in recollection now at this point is that this incident and the one I would speak to after, concerned people who were part of the Labour Party and who were police reservists and on a number of occasions had also harassed activists in the area, in particular I remember an incident where activists who had UDF banners near if my memory serves me correct, Christ the King Church, and one of the associates were also a police reservist, and a senior member of the Labour Party, Mr Clyde Pearce, chased one of the people, I think it was Greta Apelgren's brother into the church and there were a number of other reports of harassment by the same group of people.   They were viewed in terms of loose talk at that time, as the armed wing of the Labour Party, that is how people spoke of them.   But I mention, it is neither here nor there, I just mention it for the sake of completeness, in this operation I was unaware of the target before, other than that, I have no problem with the target.</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> So for the purposes of the record, you regarded it nonetheless as a legitimate target?</p>

<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> For the reasons you have outlined, namely not least he is a police reservist, his being a police reservist and his being a member of the Labour Party?</p>

<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> I then take you to the next operation, which is a handgrenade attack on the house of Mr Peter Klein on the 1st of May 1986.</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> Mr - these two handgrenade attacks occurred after you became a full member of the ANC and MK?</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> That is correct sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> Are these the only two attacks that you were involved in as against members of the tricameral system, etc?</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> As far as I can recall, yes sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> Why weren't there more, there were surely many more of these characters in Durban or in the area at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> Sir, I think we got arrested before we could carry out more operations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Thank you.  Thank you Judge.  Mr McBride, the handgrenade attack on the house of Mr Peter Klein is dealt with in bundle A1 on page 9 as item 15.  Do you see that?  Sorry, item 15, yes.</p>

<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> And therefore you do not refer to it in your application for amnesty specifically, but in paragraph 9(a)(i) as a part of all the acts listed in your indictment, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> Yes, I endeavoured, I don't know if I succeeded completely in putting all the counts from my indictment, under one section and referring the Committee to the indictment, so that I didn't, I was not aware of all the aspects as I did not have the record of the charges, but I wanted to get amnesty on the basis of the indictment, whatever it was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Thank you.   You see that the persons injured here are Mr Peter Klein, Brenda Klein as per page 9 and there were no persons that were deceased, correct?</p>

<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a>	"However here again Mr Klein was a police reservist closely associated with the Labour Party.  At that stage police reservists were viewed as collaborators and this was compounded by the fact that Klein was an influential member of the Labour Party and that this Party participated in the tricameral system which was perceived by the ANC as being illegitimate and supporting the concept of apartheid and racism in South Africa.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a>	Furthermore I repeat the Labour Party supported the state of emergency and cross-border raids.  In this operation there was serious injuries to Mr and Mrs Klein.  However, the sum total of my involvement in this operation was training and arming people in accordance with the instructions that I had received from my Commander, Rashid, and also the general instructions from the ANC to attack collaborators and police."</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Mr McBride, you do take responsibility for this incident, do you not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> Yes, I take responsibility for this incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> You have no difficulty with Mr Klein's house as having been a legitimate target?</p>

<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you know who carried out the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> Yes, the attack was carried out by one of my co-applicants, Matthew Lecordier and Antonio du Preez, who was a co-accused of my father in the trial that took place simultaneously with mine in 1987.</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> And Mr du Preez was charged for this incident as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> He was charged and sentenced to 15 and a half years, which he served some of the time on Robben Island.</p>

<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry Mr McBride, these two, you say that you were unaware of the target before the attack.   Was that how you operated in your unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You were the Commander even at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> That is correct yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And did you give instructions to your members to identify targets or did you, did they know what sort of targets to identify?  If you could just expatiate on that a bit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.  Yes, I told them that they should attack enemy personnel, there was a casspir also they were told to attack.  For both the handgrenade attacks, army, police, collaborators, that is as far as I can remember.  I can just add also, I had given them instructions that they should not throw the grenade against the house, because there are incidents where it bounced back and injured them.  I instructed them specifically to throw the handgrenades into the window, to stand close by.   The purpose of the attacks was to kill or injure enemy personnel or collaborators.</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just to get clarity on how it worked.  Would you have been informed prior to the attack, that they were going to carry out an attack or did you only sort of learn ex post facto that the attack had taken place and that was the first time that you were aware of an attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> I would know that an attack would take place within the next few weeks or the next few days, because I have issued the weapons to them.  I wouldn't know specifically the day the attack would take place on, or the specific intended target.</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> Would you know in giving or providing the equipment the details of the plan?</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> Not specifically sir, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> On what basis would you then approve of a planned attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> Well, that it would be against enemy personnel and collaborators, as I mentioned, that is all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> Not who and where?</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> No, I would not give a specific name, no.  I would not give a specific name or where.</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In this case that you have just mentioned now, the Klein's, I am not sure how they pronounce their name, you said that Mr Klein was considered to be a collaborator in that he was a police reservist and a member of the Labour Party.  What about Mrs Klein?</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> Well, Mrs Klein fell into the same category as being in the crossfire and going after enemy personnel and collaborators.</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Mr McBride, you addressed Mr Klein in this incident on the basis that he was the police reservist and the person who participated in the Labour Party activities, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> That is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> As I understand it, the handgrenade attack, you say was designed and directed at Mr Klein?</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> That is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Mrs Klein unfortunately got caught in the crossfire?</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> That is correct yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> You mentioned something about how the handgrenade attacks were to be carried out.   You spoke about the difficulty that if it were thrown without the glass of the window being broken first, it may bounce back?</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> No, what he said Mr Dehal is that his instructions were to see to it that it was thrown through a window of the house, rather than against the wall, to avoid it bouncing back and injuring themselves.  That is how I understood it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Thank you Judge, thank you.  Is there anything that you wish to add to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> At this stage I just wish to add that as with the other incident where there were injuries in the Chamberlain Road, I am sorry for the injuries and in the first incident, the deaths I have caused in these operations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Thank you, you deal with that aspect I see, later in your statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> But for the time being, we will just confine ourselves to the operations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Thank you.  We now go to the Edendale Hospital escape of Gordon Webster, which took place on the 4th of May 1986.  This is an aspect that you were charged with and the trial dealt at length with this incident, do you recall?</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> And it is actually item 14 on page 8 of bundle A1, do you see that?</p>

<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a>	"Some time during the end of April, I obtained knowledge that Gordon Webster who was my Commander at first, but who had not separated into another unit, had been arrested and injured by police, and was held at Edendale Hospital in Pietermaritzburg. 	As a soldier of Umkhonto weSizwe, the first thing one does in captivity is to try to escape.   I, myself, escaped from detention when I was in detention as my first sign of resistance to my capture.  I was shot and then recaptured.  Secondly, if one of your comrades are captured as a soldier, it is your duty to help them escape.   Any soldier does that anywhere in the world.   On these grounds alone, I initially decided that a rescue operation should be mounted."</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a>	I just want to add if there is ever the contention that I did it because Gordon Webster was my friend and close associate, yes, he was my friend and close associate, but that was not the reason why I decided on the operation.   </p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a>"Gordon was really my senior although now in a different command.  The moment he was captured, I assumed command of both units.   I then assembled both units and put a plan into place to attempt a rescue.   The reconnaissance took place on a daily basis at the hospital and over a lengthy period."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> What would that lengthy period be?</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> I cannot remember exactly sir, but it would be from the time I first found out and the time I first decided to carry out the operation, until the day, even the day just before the operation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> Approximately how many days between your obtaining this knowledge and the operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> I would say anything between seven and ten days.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a>"People involved with me in the operation were Matthew Lecordier, Greta Apelgren, Thembawelile Khumalo who was from Gordon's Pietermaritzburg unit, Antonio du Preez and my father, Derrick McBride who volunteered to be part of the operation when Naziem Cassim refused to assist.  This is the second time Naziem was not available for an operation to which he had previously agreed to be involved in.   The comrades in Pietermaritzburg were contacted about the proposed operation   (I am sorry, this is not correct), the comrades in Botswana were contacted about the proposed operation and gave us the go-ahead."</blockquote>

<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a>	"They also gave us the go-ahead to use material which was in the possession of Gordon Webster's unit, to help us effect the attack.   </p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a>	The attack was planned to take place after visiting hours, so that there would be a minimal number of civilian visitors at the hospital.  The reason was that it would have been easier to effect the operation with the least number of people around.   </p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a>	The initial plan of the operation was that a hole would be cut out in the fence at the back of the hospital so as not to attract attention.  The getaway car would be parked next to the fence with its hazard lights on and its bonnet up to indicate that it might be broken down.   We would enter from the back, go the second floor where Gordon was being kept, hold up the police, subdue them and lock them in the laundry room around the corner.  The information we received from contacts in the hospital was that Gordon was able to walk.  This information was later proved not to be true, he was unable to walk.   </p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a>	Having subdued the two policemen, we would have taken Gordon out, loaded him into the van which was the getaway vehicle, dress him up and take him, exchange cars (I think there might be a grammatical error there) and he would be in a car with Greta Apelgren, a different car who would then drive him back to a designated spot.  The weapons that were used in the operation, would be handed over to Themba Khumalo  who would have already dug a hole in preparation for putting the weapons in there and covering them up.  His job also included as part of the operation, detonating two handgrenades in the vicinity of a police station in the opposite direction to which we were travelling, so as to draw the police to that area and to enable us to effect a getaway.  The reason why Themba was the person instructed to do this was that he was from the area."</p>

The reason behind this was that when people left the scene, no one would have any weapons on them and the getaway vehicle would be left in the Pietermaritzburg town, wiped down for fingerprints and people would make their way by public transport to the designated meeting spot which I think was my father's workshop in Durban.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a>	During the operation we entered the hospital as planned, after visiting hours and made our way up to the second floor where Gordon was.  My father entered ahead of me to see whether the situation was as we had planned it to be.  After approximately 30 seconds, he came back and told me that we would have to abort the situation because there were a number of civilians around.  On attempting to confirm that this is indeed the case, I was confronted with a policeman who was armed with his weapon pointing at me.  (I would just remove "out" sir)  I was armed with an AKMS assault rifle placed under a coat."</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Sorry Mr McBride, what coat was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> It was a white coat, we were disguised as if we were doctors.</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> You were disguised as a doctor for easy access to Edendale Hospital?</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> That is correct.</p>

<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Yes, and you had this firearm you say beneath this white coat?</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> You had to remove the firearm and take off the safety you say, in order to fire the policeman before he had fired at you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> That is correct.  I just want to add that I could not remove the safety to a single shot position as I would have preferred, because the folding butt of the AK does not allow you to do it when it is folded.  You are only able to push it down if the butt is open and hence it was on automatic when I used it.  I fired at him and as, if I recall correctly, subsequent evidence indicated, I actually struck his weapon itself, putting it out of order.</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> And here Mr McBride, when you talk of subsequent evidence, is this evidence at the trial, at your trial in this matter?</p>

I was not aware who the civilians were that my father referred to at that stage as people were sitting on the bench normally used by the police to play cards.  They immediately dived for the floor and moved in such a way that I believed they were police, taking up positions to counter attack or return fire.  I then fired a burst at the group.  It was probably during this burst at the group that is the second burst, that Mlungize Buthelezi was killed and his friends who were with him, waiting for their mother who was a nurse, were injured.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a>	As I entered the ward and shouted Gordon's name, I came under fire from a policeman, Johannes Hendrik Visagie.  I returned fire and struck him on the hand.   He retreated to a room within the ward.  I then noticed Gordon Webster in the bed."</p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a>	At this stage I must say that my recollection is not very clear and my recollection of the sequence of events are a bit jumbled.  I just want to add an example to illustrate.  In subsequent discussions afterwards I had asked, I remember saying to Gordon in the ward that he should move, he should move, because he was laying on the bed looking at me.  He said to me there is a policeman and I responded by saying which policeman and this is after I had fired at Visagie.  I am not sure as to why I said which policeman, when I knew there was a policeman firing at me, so my recollection of events in the ward at that stage, are quite jumbled.  I am not sure if it is of any significance, I am just saying that I cannot remember clearly.  I just assimilated events as things happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Mr McBride, as to Mr Visagie, you did not know his name at the time when you fired, you got to know this name during the course of your trial?</p>

<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> You then say you apparently also fired two more shots at Visagie after he had fired at you through the door from the room?</p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> Yes, this is another incident, I don't recall this clearly.   If I did, I wouldn't have any problem with it, he is a policeman, he is keeping my comrade in captivity, I would shoot at him, there is no problem with that.  I just don't recall it clearly.</p>

<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a>	"This was not a bomb as is evident from the transcript.  This was defused by the police, there was no detonator placed in this explosive device, on purpose.   </p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a>	During May 1986, the Eminent Persons Group of the Commonwealth visited South Africa in the hope of brokering a negotiations deal between the liberation movement and the South African government, then headed by P.W. Botha.  If my memory serves me correct, the Head of the delegation was the present President of Nigeria, Mr ...(indistinct).   In an attempt to scupper the possibility of a deal, P.W. Botha sent South African Security Forces to attack a number of targets in the neighbouring States simultaneously.  P.W. Botha did this, it was widely believed at the time, to set about a negotiations process which excluded the ANC.  This I understand was the message he had given to the Eminent Persons Group.  	</p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a>	At this stage I decided as Commander of my unit, that it was important that the ANC's presence be felt at that specific time so that the ANC can be regarded as an integral part of any lasting solution to the then conflict.   A device was then put together, consisting of explosive charges which on their own are inert, for example it can be thrown from a building or it can be put in a fire, but will remain harmless.  These devices were camouflaged with paper, electric wire, aerosol spray to make them appear to be more sinister than they actually were.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a>	Together with Jeanette Apelgren, who was subsequently a State witness against me in the trial, who is the sister of Greta, I proceeded to the Pine Parkade as a central location in Durban and placed the "bomb" under (it should be under, not on), under one of the cars.  This was intentionally done at the Pine Parkade, as this was known as one of the most secure parking garages in the city at the time and in full knowledge that the parcel would be found very quickly.  The parcel was found and the police attempted to "disarm" or "defuse" the "bomb".  The remainder of the so-called bomb which was thought to contain a detonator, was taken away in a bomb disposal vehicle and by ten o'clock the following morning, had not exploded clearly indicating that there was no detonator in there."   </p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a>	I must just mention here that the Security Police at the time went together with the media, went on a long song and dance about how terrible the ANC is, placing such a device there, and neglected to mention that the device did not explode and would not have exploded. </p>

I was sentenced to, if my memory serves me correct, to two years.

As to why it was not placed before the Court and after  requests for further particulars by my legal team in 1987, I can only speculate that it is because he was a Security Policeman and it would affect statistics if his name is included in there.</p>

The purpose of the operation was to commemorate the raid on Gaberone in which 12 people were killed, including ANC members, women, that is plural, and a child.  None of the people were military personnel of the ANC at that time.  It was also intended to commemorate the massacre of school children on the 16th of June 1976.  This was the 10th anniversary.

<p class="line" id="line605"><a name="pos605"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> From before Easter, I can only remember it like that.  Before Easter 1986 because the car bomb instructions were during the period we left, which I think was the Easter weekend when we were all in Botswana and that is how I remember it, and from then onwards, we had started working on it.  It was some time before Eastern because by the time, the last time I was together with Gordon, Vic, Chris and Oupa, already at that stage, a target including a bar, was discussed.   My recollection, already at that stage it was, had been reconnoitred and Intelligence had been gathered.</p>

<p class="line" id="line609"><a name="pos609"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> It is about six weeks, a month to six weeks from the first one.  That was before my personal involvement for the operation.</p>

<p class="line" id="line614"><a name="pos614"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> Yes, the purpose for going out during that week was to go and pick up weapons for a car bomb specifically, and secondly for some weapons to prepare a DLB for another unit coming into the country.  I prepared the car specifically to receive the SZ6 charges for the car bomb.</p>
<p class="line" id="line615"><a name="pos615"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> And Mr McBride in as much as you returned on the 12th, this operation was carried out on the 14th?</p>

<p class="line" id="line617"><a name="pos617"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Did you do additional reconnaissance work between the 12th and the 14th or had you set your mind on the target by then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line618"><a name="pos618"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> Well, the target was already, my mind was set on it already, that is why I discussed it with the Commander when I went back to receive the formal instructions.  There was no change or regard to any other target at that stage, once the go-ahead was given and I think it is better if I read through it.</p>

None of those killed or injured, had any link to the military or SAP.  This was recorded pursuant to my Section 29 evidence and is incorrect for amongst other things, I was not questioned on an in depth level at the Section 29 enquiry about reconnaissance.  It was a very superficial questioning with regards to this.  I simply answered the questions asked of me.  </p>

<p class="line" id="line653"><a name="pos653"></a>	On numerous occasions we reconnoitred the place and placed it under surveillance.  We looked at alternatives of the type of attack that can be used, we then came to the conclusion that a car bomb would not be appropriate for the Military base, mainly because of the openness of the area and secondly because no private cars were allowed to park close to the premises of Natal Command.   During this period I also explained to Gordon my information, which was discussed during 1984 and 1985 of the general belief amongst activists at that time, when I frequented the Alan Taylor residence, that the Why Not bar was frequented by large numbers of police and military personnel.  I also explained to Gordon the conversation I overheard during an unconnected court appearance in which police were discussing visiting the Why Not bar.

This together with the fact that Gordon had said he had completed his reconnaissance and used the word "infested with police", was sufficient evidence for me that this was a legitimate target.

Mr Davidson was asked by my lawyer whether to his knowledge his place was frequented by Security Force personnel from C.R. Swart and from the military, what I can recall from the conversation was that he confirmed this, he mentioned C.R. Swart, he also mentioned something like Dunnitor Boys Army Pilot, he also indicated that at some stage he was accused of some crime, I think it was selling drugs and the same police who frequented the place, assisted him in getting rid of the charge.  He also added that at one stage one of the police who frequented the place, he met whilst in uniform   at a race course and this guy even gave him a tip to place a bet on something, which won, I think he said Jamaican Music.

Rashid explained to me the Kabwe Conference and the change of policy and amongst other things, that the ANC would not be too careful any more in going after Security Force personnel.  I was told that the injury to civilians was a secondary consideration at that stage and that the main concern was to go (it should say here Security personnel) wherever they may be on duty or off duty.  The only equivocation given to me was that there should be absolutely no chance of children being killed in the operation.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line683"><a name="pos683"></a>	It was on the basis of the sum total of all Intelligence information gathered, ...(indistinct) the fact that the problems I expressed of civilians being part of the casualties and which was carefully considered by my seniors and the fact that in spite of this I was given the go-ahead for the operation, that I agreed to go ahead with this operation.   I left Botswana on the 11th of June and I arrived on the morning of the 12th with the specific instruction to carry out the operation on the 14th of June, a Saturday.  I was given funds for the purchase of a car under a false name, and for additional material which could be used in preparing the car bomb.   </p>
<p class="line" id="line684"><a name="pos684"></a>	I cannot recall the sequence of all the events very clearly, but what I can say is that the people who assisted me within the country with the operation were not aware that the car bomb operation was to take place.   We all operated on a strictly need to know discipline."</p>
<p class="line" id="line685"><a name="pos685"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry Mr McBride, sorry, when you went to Botswana on the 11th, you had in your mind you say the target, the Why Not bar?</p>
<p class="line" id="line686"><a name="pos686"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line687"><a name="pos687"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you have alternative targets, had you reconnoitred, when I say you, you and or members of your unit, reconnoitred alternative targets?</p>
<p class="line" id="line688"><a name="pos688"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> There was the place The Barn, but it had not been reconnoitred to the extent of the Why Not and also I felt uneasy in the place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line689"><a name="pos689"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So if you knew when you were in Botswana at that stage, that your target was going to be the Why Not bar, was there any particular reason why you should not mention that to Mr Ismail, your Commander?</p>
<p class="line" id="line690"><a name="pos690"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> Yes, one of the very obvious reasons was that when Rashid came into the room, he looked around for bugs immediately.  If I had given him the specific target and named it, if there were any bugs in there, it would obviously have gone to the Security Police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line691"><a name="pos691"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, what sort of room were you in, were you not in an ANC stronghouse or stronghold or whatever?</p>
<p class="line" id="line692"><a name="pos692"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> A hotel.  No, as far as I can remember, we were in a hotel room.</p>
<p class="line" id="line693"><a name="pos693"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> A hotel room?</p>
<p class="line" id="line694"><a name="pos694"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> I remember Rashid putting on the airconditioner to cause a disturbance with noise if there was any listening devices.</p>
<p class="line" id="line695"><a name="pos695"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line696"><a name="pos696"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Sorry, but then you discussed that the car bomb would go on the 14th of June specifically?</p>
<p class="line" id="line697"><a name="pos697"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line698"><a name="pos698"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> But you didn't discuss the specific venue?</p>
<p class="line" id="line699"><a name="pos699"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> I am not sure I understand you Ma'am?</p>
<p class="line" id="line700"><a name="pos700"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> That it was going to be the Why Not bar, but you discussed that a car bomb would go?</p>
<p class="line" id="line701"><a name="pos701"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> We discussed the bar as I mentioned earlier, but not the Why Not bar or any other particular bar.</p>
<p class="line" id="line702"><a name="pos702"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> I think the question is if your fear that the Security Police in South Africa may overhear you by virtue of the bugs, and that is the reason why you did not mention the name of the bar, or your target, how come that you discussed some other details with regard to the operation in those same circumstances?</p>
<p class="line" id="line703"><a name="pos703"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> Well, they would know that there is an operation that is about to take place, they wouldn't know where it is.  They wouldn't be able to ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line704"><a name="pos704"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> It would be easy to look out for you and then arrest you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line705"><a name="pos705"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> I would concede that is a possibility, that is why I took care when approaching the place also, to do, to check if there were any roadblocks around the place when I approach it later on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line706"><a name="pos706"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line707"><a name="pos707"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> Another issue I just want to raise with you.  You say the people who assisted you with the operation, were not aware of the car bomb operation and that it would take place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line708"><a name="pos708"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> That is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line709"><a name="pos709"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> What did they do, how did they contribute to the operation then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line710"><a name="pos710"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> Well, I required a driver of one car to secure a spot as close as possible to the target, that is the Why Not bar, and the person I chose was Greta Apelgren.</p>
<p class="line" id="line711"><a name="pos711"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> She went to create a parking space as near as possible to the Why Not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line712"><a name="pos712"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> Under my instructions, direct instructions, I was sitting next to her in the car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line713"><a name="pos713"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> But she didn't know that you were going to plant a car bomb there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line714"><a name="pos714"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> She could not have known as I did not tell her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line715"><a name="pos715"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> Okay.  And the other person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line716"><a name="pos716"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> The other person was Matthew Lecordier, who is one of the co-applicants, who was also under the impression I would leave the car for comrades to pick it up later.  He was only told of the operation as we entered into town.  I don't even remember if I told him specifically of the operation, but I did indicate to him as we came off the southern freeway, I see it is changed now, we hit a bump, there was a bump as you came down, and stopped just before you enter Durban and I indicated to him that there was 60 kilograms of explosives in the boot.  Even at that stage, I don't think I told him what the operation was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line717"><a name="pos717"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> What was his contribution to the operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line718"><a name="pos718"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> He would give me cover while I am initiating and he would watch out for me while I am busy initiating the explosive device in the car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line719"><a name="pos719"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> Although he wouldn't know what you were actually doing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line720"><a name="pos720"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> He didn't know.  What I told him was that we were leaving the car for some other comrades in town.</p>
<p class="line" id="line721"><a name="pos721"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> Carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line722"><a name="pos722"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> Just to add, it is not the first time we operated in that manner in the unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line723"><a name="pos723"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Mr McBride, I don't know whether you dealt with this on the preceding page, I see you are now on page 14.</p>
<p class="line" id="line724"><a name="pos724"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> Yes sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line725"><a name="pos725"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> But you all operated on a strictly need to know discipline?</p>
<p class="line" id="line726"><a name="pos726"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line727"><a name="pos727"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Okay, now just to dwell briefly on a need to know discipline, can you explain why there was such a discipline necessary and how it was put into operation, you being the Commander of your cell?</p>
<p class="line" id="line728"><a name="pos728"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> One of the things you are taught when you are recruited is what we call Military Combat Work, MCW, which involved knowledge about codes and how you would operate.  For example not asking unnecessary questions, not speaking loosely about operations you were involved in, forgetting operations after you had done them, which we refer to it as a dream.  It is a dream, it never happened, we would say.  General stuff that any guerrilla organisation does to survive, to prevent police tracking it down and compromising it.  I don't think it is any different to any other organisation.  An example is Jeanette Apelgren with the Pine Parkade hoax-bomb, she didn't know why I picked her up.  She didn't know why I told her to park next to the car, she didn't know why I told her to drive off.  She followed my instructions, occasionally there would be some tensions.  In particular Greta didn't like to be just told what to do, although she followed it.  There would be tension, but she followed my instructions, that is the way we operated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line729"><a name="pos729"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Was this not also obviously because of the reason that if the operation had not successfully gone off and if any person was arrested, then the person who operated within the ambit of the need to know discipline would not be able to give information to the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line730"><a name="pos730"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> Yes, exactly.  For example, many of the operations that I was not convicted of or was not suspected of, the only reason why is I never spoke to anybody about them, and that is why the police did not know about it and could not question me on it.  For that reason, it is obvious to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line731"><a name="pos731"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> I see that in some, whilst you deal with that now, perhaps we should just deal with this, in some of those operations in regard to which you were not charged, Naziem Cassim had featured at a level, he was a State witness in your trial, had there been no need to know discipline, he would have known it all and told the police about it, and you obviously would have been charged, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line732"><a name="pos732"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> That is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line733"><a name="pos733"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> And on the same lines, when Rashid was in the hotel room and switched on the airconditioning unit so that there would be disturbance you said, the reason you did not speak of the Why Not bar was if you were to have talked about it you said, the police could have pinned you down at the Why Not bar and the operation would probably not have gone on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line734"><a name="pos734"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> That is correct yes.  There was also an element of distrust.  If one remembers that at that stage a number of ANC people had been - supposedly blown themselves up with their own - in fact the unit I had worked with in Wentworth, some of the guys were killed with a premature explosion at a white school in the Bluff, that was to be used for electoral purposes before I joined Special Ops.  So there was always this paranoia about infiltration, fiddling with the weapons and so on.  So yes, we were careful because we were at war and we would always say to ourselves, these guys work 24 hours a day to nail us therefore we must be extra careful.</p>
<p class="line" id="line735"><a name="pos735"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> What about infiltration within the ANC in exile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line736"><a name="pos736"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> That is a well known fact, a well documented fact, there was infiltration.</p>
<p class="line" id="line737"><a name="pos737"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> And for these reasons there was a need for that discipline?</p>
<p class="line" id="line738"><a name="pos738"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line739"><a name="pos739"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Thank you.  If you could then go to page 14, you are at (vi) which begins with "Greta Apelgren was acquitted".</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line740"><a name="pos740"></a>MR McBRIDE</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line741"><a name="pos741"></a>	"Greta Apelgren was acquitted of any involvement in the Why Not incident.  She had to secure a parking place as close as possible to the Why Not bar and she did this on my instructions at the closest possible place one could get to the bar.  Matthew Lecordier also assisted.  He only became aware that this was a car bomb operation once we had reached the town.  He was there to give me cover.  Both Greta and Matthew were under the impression that we were going to leave the car for other comrades of another unit.  This other unit they believed was there and would take delivery of the vehicle."</p>
<p class="line" id="line742"><a name="pos742"></a>	I just want to add in here that at some stage prior to this, before going out to Botswana for the last time, we had prepared if my memory serves me correct, a DLB, to be filled later on with weapons I would bring out and Matthew and Greta assisted me in preparing the DLB which was not to be used by us, but by another unit.</p>

One was left behind because it was going to be used in case there was retaliation for the operation.  It was going to be used for an additional response in an attack possibly a police station, which we had reconnoitred earlier.  As per instructions, detonators were added to all SZ6 charges, so as to give the explosion a greater impact.  In other words you would have simultaneous detonation of all charges.   If my memory serves me correct, it was Oupa who gave me the instruction to use detonators in each SZ6 charge so that all aspects of the explosion was simultaneous.</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line755"><a name="pos755"></a>	Also as per instructions, I added shrapnel to the explosive charges.  Those I was able to get from for example cutting old burglar guards in my father's workshop and placing it amongst the shrapnel.   </p>

<p class="line" id="line760"><a name="pos760"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr McBride, whereabouts in the vehicle did you put these explosive devices?

<p class="line" id="line761"><a name="pos761"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> No, they were placed in the boot, that is the way I was instructed.  They were placed in the boot and secured so that they don't move around, because you have detonators in each one of them.  If you hit a bump and they move, it would go up prematurely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line762"><a name="pos762"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you estimated, you mentioned earlier, 60 kilograms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line763"><a name="pos763"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line764"><a name="pos764"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that your estimate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line765"><a name="pos765"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> Yes, yes, that is my estimate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line766"><a name="pos766"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay, you have said it was your first bomb, but where would 60 kilograms rate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line767"><a name="pos767"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> It is a small car bomb.  It is a small car bomb, other car bombs generally in the region of 200 kilograms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line768"><a name="pos768"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>

But if I can remember correctly, it wasn't specifically at that stage for a car bomb. At the time of being given instructions specifically for June the 14th car bomb, Chris was not around.  I last saw Chris when I dropped off Gordon Webster, he was arrested the day before the May 19th raid into Botswana.  I didn't see him again until here at this hearing.</p>

<p class="line" id="line786"><a name="pos786"></a>	"When the explosive device in the car was ready, I then sought assistance of Matthew Lecordier and Greta Apelgren.  Greta was used in securing the exact spot that I required at the Why Not bar and Matthew served to give me cover.

<p class="line" id="line788"><a name="pos788"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Sorry Mr McBride, whilst you are there, you talk of the state of emergency, is it correct that the national state of emergency was then just declared, a day or two old?</p>

When I was satisfied that no roadblocks or no unusual (it shouldn't be political, it should be) police activity was present at the end of West Street, I then returned to the upper end of West Street where we picked up the other car and drove as close as possible to the other target.</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line795"><a name="pos795"></a>	We left the bomb and left Matthew in the car together with Greta to try and secure a parking place.  Although there were other parking places around the Why Not bar, I chose the place most appropriate, which was the closest and right at the corner.  After the place closest to the Why Not was secured, I then walked back to where Matthew was and came with the blue Ford Cortina, which had the explosive device in the car.   I indicated to Greta to move out and then parked the blue Ford Cortina in the designated place.  I then activated the explosive and left the scene.  I then got into Greta's car and we proceeded.   </p>
<p class="line" id="line796"><a name="pos796"></a>	As I had not filled up petrol in the getaway car, I then decided to do this.  This was normal procedure for Special Ops to fill petrol before any operation and I had neglected to do this.   The reason I was taught this for was that at some previous stage comrades had effected an attack, retreated and ran out of petrol during the retreat and were later killed.   We took it as an axiom,  always fill up the car with petrol.  On this occasion I forgot to do it.  I think we did fill petrol in Petrus Street or close to that area.  Immediately after filling up petrol, I realised that the bomb must have already exploded, because I set it only for 15 minutes.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line797"><a name="pos797"></a>	I then proceeded to the Durban Flying Squad area on Ridge Road, where I expected to hear police sirens as this would have indicated to me whether the bomb had already gone off and whether a Security cordon had already been thrown around the city.    I was concerned that we might have trapped ourselves in the cordon by setting the time too short.  After sitting on the Ridge Road for approximately five minutes, we then left the area and drove home.  I dropped off Greta and Matthew."</p>
<p class="line" id="line798"><a name="pos798"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr McBride, could you just indicate perhaps a distance, approximately how far that vehicle with the bomb was parked from the nearest point of the Why Not bar to it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line799"><a name="pos799"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> It is difficult to say at this stage, because I have gone passed the place recently and it seems to be a change of the pavement there where it is.   But I indicated using the police exhibit, at the TRC hearing, there should be an exhibit somewhere here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line800"><a name="pos800"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  But could you not just point out a distance, was it for instance the car further away from the Why Not bar than what Mr Richard is away from you at the moment, or was it hard up against it, close?</p>
<p class="line" id="line801"><a name="pos801"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> About from here to where the Translators are.</p>
<p class="line" id="line802"><a name="pos802"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  So that is about what would you agree to...</p>
<p class="line" id="line803"><a name="pos803"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> It wouldn't be further than that.  Under 10 metres.</p>
<p class="line" id="line804"><a name="pos804"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That is about 12, it can be paced off.</p>
<p class="line" id="line805"><a name="pos805"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> About 15.</p>
<p class="line" id="line806"><a name="pos806"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, it is about 15 paces, that distance I would estimate, I don't know what counsel thinks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line807"><a name="pos807"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> Yes, it was the closest, I couldn't have come any closer by parking the car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line808"><a name="pos808"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Mr McBride, when you say you couldn't have come any closer, are you saying that there were no parking bays closer to the Why Not bar, or is it because the pavement was wide enough away from the entrance to the Why Not to the road, where the cars are parked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line809"><a name="pos809"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> I can explain it this way, if I had gone on the pavement and parked right next to it, it would have been the closest, but I probably would have attracted attention and been arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line810"><a name="pos810"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> So the car, sorry the blue Ford Cortina in which the bomb was, was right next to the pavement, which pavement was closest to the Why Not bar?</p>
<p class="line" id="line811"><a name="pos811"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> That is correct yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line812"><a name="pos812"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Not the opposite pavement or the adjacent pavement on the side road?</p>
<p class="line" id="line813"><a name="pos813"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> That is correct yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line814"><a name="pos814"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Thank you.   Sorry, just bear with me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line815"><a name="pos815"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, just while we are waiting for Mr Dehal, when you were there, when you put the car with the bomb there, did you see any activity at the Why Not bar and that area, what was happening people wise?</p>
<p class="line" id="line816"><a name="pos816"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> I didn't see any big amounts of people, I didn't notice people.  I didn't notice people.  I think when I got out of the car, there were some people near the entrance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line817"><a name="pos817"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Approximately what time of the evening would it have been?</p>
<p class="line" id="line818"><a name="pos818"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> It was, as we had reconnoitred, it would have been about half past nine, if I remember correctly.  That is the same, a similar time to when we followed the people from C.R. Swart.</p>
<p class="line" id="line819"><a name="pos819"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Dehal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line820"><a name="pos820"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson, I am indebted to you.  CHAIRPERSON:   We have just been handed some photographs here of the place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line821"><a name="pos821"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Oh, I see, those are the photographs I presume from the trial exhibits.</p>
<p class="line" id="line822"><a name="pos822"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ... numbers 95 through to 97.  Mr Dehal, you can continue if you want.</p>
<p class="line" id="line823"><a name="pos823"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.  Mr McBride, I now take you in regard to the Why Not incident, through the trial transcripts.  I have before me some excerpts from the trial records.  May I just show you three pages of the trial transcripts, enumerated page 761, 762 and 763 being an extract of the evidence of a witness, a State witness in that trial, the witness being Mr B.R. Erasmus.  In particular I show you page 762.  Would you care to read the relevant aspects thereof relating to his testimony wherein he alludes to his police activity, training, experience.  Mr Chairperson, before Mr McBride does so, may I just hand these in to yourself and the honourable members and my colleagues on the other side.</p>
<p class="line" id="line824"><a name="pos824"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  This will be Exhibit J.  We will leave out the I.  This is Exhibit J.</p>

<p class="line" id="line826"><a name="pos826"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> Before I read this out, I must state that this was as per my instructions to my legal team as to the questions asked of witnesses.  This is how the questions went.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line827"><a name="pos827"></a>"Have you done any service in the Police Force?  Yes, I have.  When?  I left in either 1981 or 1982.  You left in 1981 or 1982?   Correct.  But for how long were you there?  Three, three and a half years approximately."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line828"><a name="pos828"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> Chairperson, Mr Mall and I haven't got copies of the exhibit yet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line829"><a name="pos829"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, I couldn't find the spot where you are reading from Mr McBride, are you reading from page 762?</p>
<p class="line" id="line830"><a name="pos830"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> 762.  Do you have it Mr Richard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line831"><a name="pos831"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Sorry, I sent copies around.</p>
<p class="line" id="line832"><a name="pos832"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> I have nothing at all, I think there weren't enough to go around.  Mr Mall and I didn't get our ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line833"><a name="pos833"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think they will make other copies, but if you can perhaps use that one in the meantime and ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line834"><a name="pos834"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> I apologise Mr Chairman, I thought I handed over sufficient copies, it was not intended.  May I just look to see if I've got more copies.     Yes, I have additional copies.</p>
<p class="line" id="line835"><a name="pos835"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, we've got extra copies here, if you can just send them around, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line836"><a name="pos836"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> I think two copies are needed.  Sorry Mr Chairperson, we are dealing with the second page, there are three pages there, from about line 6 downwards from where the words start with "yes, have you done any service in the Police Force" and the answer there is "yes, I have."  The next question is "when" and Mr McBride was at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line837"><a name="pos837"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line838"><a name="pos838"></a>MR McBRIDE:	The person responded</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line839"><a name="pos839"></a>		"I left in either 1981 or 1982.  You left in 1981 or 1982?  Correct.  For how long were you there?  Three, three and a half years approximately.  From about what year?  From about the end of 1978.   Where were you stationed?  I was stationed in the Drakensberg district, Bulwar to be exact."</p>
<p class="line" id="line840"><a name="pos840"></a>	In effect, this is the questions that were asked of all the witnesses who testified as victims.  That was my instructions to them.   I am not sure whether all of them were asked this question, but I know at least three were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line841"><a name="pos841"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> And this witness, Mr Erasmus, testified in the trial relating to the Why Not explosion as a person who was there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line842"><a name="pos842"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> Yes, that is correct yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line843"><a name="pos843"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> There, I mean at the Why Not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line844"><a name="pos844"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> For example a further question in the same vein is</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line845"><a name="pos845"></a>"And I assume you had many friends among the Police Force at the time?"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line846"><a name="pos846"></a>	The person answers -</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line847"><a name="pos847"></a>"In the Bulwar area I had friends yes, friends and associates."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line848"><a name="pos848"></a>	And the Advocate says -</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line849"><a name="pos849"></a>"Even in the Durban area?"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line850"><a name="pos850"></a>	And he says -</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line851"><a name="pos851"></a>"I don't know many policemen in the Durban area".</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line852"><a name="pos852"></a>	That was the train of questioning there, and one of the co-applicants, Matthew Lecordier who was a witness, was also asked questions relating to this, as to information he subsequently picked up about the operation, which was the most popular bar for Durban police at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line853"><a name="pos853"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Yes.  Mr McBride, I now take you to another witness who testified during your trial in Pietermaritzburg, and this is the witness who talked about the Why Not incident as well.  The same type of questions were asked of him, will you please go through that but before you do, will you please allow me to hand over copies.</p>
<p class="line" id="line854"><a name="pos854"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is the name of this witness, just for my notes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line855"><a name="pos855"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Mr Chairperson, the next witness will be Mr Engelbrecht.</p>
<p class="line" id="line856"><a name="pos856"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Engelbrecht, extract from trial record, Mr Engelbrecht, and that will be Exhibit K.</p>
<p class="line" id="line857"><a name="pos857"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.   Mr McBride, if I may just take you to just below the middle of that extract, from about the lines 18, 19, 20 downwards, do you see the part where I think Mr Morane the junior counsel in this matter, was cross-examining this witness, Engelbrecht and said</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line858"><a name="pos858"></a>"... yes, well Mr Nel told His Lordship and the learned gentlemen assessors, that for some years, he was a member of the Police Force.  Did you do any service in the Police Force?  (And then he answers) - yes, I did a year."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line859"><a name="pos859"></a>	Do you see that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line860"><a name="pos860"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> Yes, I see that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line861"><a name="pos861"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> The Nel here referred to is the Nel, the previous witness whose testimony and extract of which we dealt with just now, in Exhibit J.</p>
<p class="line" id="line862"><a name="pos862"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That was the extract from the evidence of a Mr Erasmus, not a Mr Nel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line863"><a name="pos863"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> I beg your pardon, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line864"><a name="pos864"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I see from this extract Mr McBride, Mr Engelbrecht says yes, he was in the police for a year before he went to university in 1966 and he was stationed in Elliot.  Now, would you at that stage have regarded him as a Security Force legitimate target, because he had been in the Police Force, 20 years prior to the incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line865"><a name="pos865"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> No sir, the point I am making here is that those were the questions that I instructed my lawyer to ask.</p>
<p class="line" id="line866"><a name="pos866"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line867"><a name="pos867"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> And Mr McBride, is it not true that this, these extracts show that these were persons who were present and I deal with another extract shortly, that is Mr Nel, persons that were present in the Why Not bar at the time the operation was carried out, and these were persons who had either been policemen at some stage or had association with them or both?</p>
<p class="line" id="line868"><a name="pos868"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line869"><a name="pos869"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Sorry, I think we have finished with that extract.   Thank you.  I now show you the said Mr Nel's evidence, an extract thereof, on page 677 of the transcript.  If you will bear with me, I just want to hand over copies again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line870"><a name="pos870"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It will be Exhibit L.</p>
<p class="line" id="line871"><a name="pos871"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.  Mr Chairperson, we deal here from lines 8 downwards, Mr McBride, do you see line 8 says - "now was this ..." - or firstly before we begin with that.  You recall this person Mr Nel, who testified in the trial, and he testified to the effect that he was at the Why Not bar at the time that the operation was carried out, he was a State witness at the trial, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line872"><a name="pos872"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> He had actually just left.  In fact only one of the people who, two of the people who were actually in the bar at the time, one who was injured, the other was Mr Davidson, actually testified at the trial.</p>
<p class="line" id="line873"><a name="pos873"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line874"><a name="pos874"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> I don't know why only two of those were in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line875"><a name="pos875"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Yes.   Now, Mr Nel dealt with the Why Not bar operation at line 9 he says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line876"><a name="pos876"></a>"now was this in the army ..."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line877"><a name="pos877"></a>... sorry, perhaps we will deal with the sentences before that.  </p>

<p class="line" id="line879"><a name="pos879"></a>		"I am."  </p>

<blockquote class="line" id="line881"><a name="pos881"></a>"Have you completed your military training?"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line882"><a name="pos882"></a>He says -</p>

<p class="line" id="line884"><a name="pos884"></a>Do you see that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line885"><a name="pos885"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> That is correct, I have that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line886"><a name="pos886"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Can you read the rest of it.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line887"><a name="pos887"></a>MR McBRIDE</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line888"><a name="pos888"></a>		"Now was this in the army or did you have to do police duties?   I did police duties.  Where and when?

What rank did you achieve in the South African Police?   I was a Detective Sergeant.  What actually did you do at the Criminal Bureau?   I was a fingerprint expert and also a draughtsman/photographer.  During your years at the police, did you by any chance meet up with Capt de Beer?

Mr McBride, may we now turn to the next operation, that is the Umlaas Mobil Oil pipeline explosion, or sorry, perhaps before we deal with this, you have heard - sorry we have dealt at some length with the evidence you had given in the Section 29 enquiry, do you recall that and we have heard that you may be cross-examined thereon?</p>

<p class="line" id="line905"><a name="pos905"></a>	"There were three operations on this night.   The others were the mini-limpet mine explosion, the vegetable oil tank storage facility in Chamberlain Road and the third one was the limpet mine explosion outside (it should be mini-limpet mine) outside the Copper Shop in Brickhill Road.  For these acts I was convicted and sentenced for all three of them.  These were done on the same day, although some exploded before the others, they were actually - charges were laid sometimes last, because the first ones in some cases, had the longer timing devices.  Matthew Lecordier, myself and Antonio du Preez carried out these operations.  Antonio drove.  He dropped us off as if we were fishing or we were going to go fishing.  This oil pipe is the same oil pipe that goes out to the Reunion terminal for tankers, that comrade Rashid referred to earlier, that another unit was tasked to sabotage this terminal.  We had found the pipe that leads to the terminal, to the oil refinery.  It is right next to the sea, hence we would not have been out of place if we pretended we were going fishing.   Myself and Matthew went and (it should be) placed the charges on the oil pipes, two charges, two limpet mines.  We walked off and Antonio came back and picked us up."</p>
<p class="line" id="line906"><a name="pos906"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did the mines go off, do you know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line907"><a name="pos907"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> Yes, they went off, I think sometime in the morning.  I think  we set a longer delay on them, than for the others, so although they were placed first, they went off last.  That is my recollection.</p>
<p class="line" id="line908"><a name="pos908"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you know what damage if any, they caused, the extent of it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line909"><a name="pos909"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> Yes, information which I received days after and at a later stage, was that there was, the two oil refineries contacted each other and the one indicating to the other, that there is an explosion at the feeder pipe, and that they should close off the valves, and I think it was Engen informed BP ...(indistinct), no, it is not ours, so there was a dispute.  The result was that a lot of oil leaked out and burnt.  The canal was then destroyed also, from the heat it cracked up and they had to fly in a special chemical to put out the fire.  It burnt for about 12 hours anyway, it was quite substantial.  I think in the trial they said R1 million, or something like that.  But I imagine it might have been more.</p>
<p class="line" id="line910"><a name="pos910"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Mr McBride, if I may just take you back to A1, pages 9 and 10,  when you talk of the three operations, do you mean operations enumerated incidents 18, 19 and 20 because all three of those are operations that took place on the same date and here they are recorded as being 21/22 June, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line911"><a name="pos911"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line912"><a name="pos912"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> You now deal with the next incident, which in that bundle is enumerated 19, and which is the mini-limpet mine explosion at the vegetable oil tanker at the corner of Lawley and Chamberlain Road.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line913"><a name="pos913"></a>MR McBRIDE:	Yes.</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line914"><a name="pos914"></a>	"The same modus operandi here was carried out as per the preceding operation, accept that I got out of the car alone and placed the charge myself."</p>
<p class="line" id="line915"><a name="pos915"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry Mr McBride, what is a vegetable oil tanker, is this cooking oil tanker?</p>
<p class="line" id="line916"><a name="pos916"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> Sir, at this stage I understand that is what the police information was, but subsequent damage indicated that this was quite a corrosive chemical, because a number of the drainage pipes out to the yacht basin were damaged, including some of the yachts that were moored there.  It couldn't have been ordinary oil.</p>
<p class="line" id="line917"><a name="pos917"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> This says vegetable oil tanker, so was it a vehicle, a lorry, a tanker, a tank?</p>

<p class="line" id="line921"><a name="pos921"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why did you choose that as a target if it was vegetable oil?</p>
<p class="line" id="line922"><a name="pos922"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> I didn't choose it because it was specifically vegetable oil, I chose it because it was in the heart of an industrial area, in Jacobs.  It was in close proximity to Wentworth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line923"><a name="pos923"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Would you have classified that as a propaganda operation?</p>

<p class="line" id="line926"><a name="pos926"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Mr McBride, may we now lead to item 20 on page 10 of A1, which is the limpet mine explosion outside the Copper Shop in Brickhill Road on the same date?</p>
<p class="line" id="line927"><a name="pos927"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> That is correct yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line928"><a name="pos928"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> You deal with that under paragraph 16.</p>
<p class="line" id="line929"><a name="pos929"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> That is correct.  This was regarded by us as an unsuccessful operation.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line930"><a name="pos930"></a>"The target was originally a police vehicle that parked almost on a permanent basis at the bottom of Point Road.  This is Point Road I think Smit Street intersection.  Matthew's task was to place the limpet mine in this vehicle and we would pick him up afterwards.   On his way to the vehicle, after being dropped off, he became scared because he was under the impression that he had been spotted by the police and he panicked and dropped the explosive device into a refuse bin.  In all three incidents carried out on 21/22 June, there were no injuries and no one was killed.  The three operations were all intended to continue the sabotage campaign, disrupt the oil supplies as in the first one - the economic sabotage and armed propaganda.   This as per instructions and policy of the ANC then."</blockquote>

<p class="line" id="line944"><a name="pos944"></a>	"At the stage this took place, Alan Pearce had been recruited by Matthew Lecordier into the cell that was made up of him and Antonio du Preez.  As an operation which was in line with the disruption of industrial water supplies to the New Germany/Pinetown area and which sought economic sabotage and armed propaganda on behalf of the ANC.  This operation was also planned as an initiation operation for Alan Pearce and he and Matthew and Antonio would be working together.   The modus operandi was the same.  </p>

I then picked them up after about five minutes, and they placed the charges and drove off.  The pipes were damaged and the water supply to the industrial area, was disrupted for a few days.  There were no deceased and no persons injured.  I was convicted and sentenced for this operation also."</p>
<p class="line" id="line946"><a name="pos946"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Thank you.   That concludes the list of incidents recorded on A1 from pages 6 to 10.  I may now take you to your application for amnesty, particularly to page 106.  Do you see item (f) and (h) there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line947"><a name="pos947"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> That is correct, I see that yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line948"><a name="pos948"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Now, can we deal with item (f) first, because it was not enumerated in those pages we have just dealt with and deals in part with other aspects possibly?  You say there you recruited, trained and supplied with the weapons, a combat unit in Taylorshof, Macabisa area of Edendale, Pietermaritzburg.  You say you do not know the names of the persons you trained.  Can you tell us a little bit about that count for which you seek amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line949"><a name="pos949"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> Yes, after I had been instructed by or given the go-ahead to use material from Gordon's unit for the Edendale operation, I had to pick up what was left of the cache.  Apparently the unit had panicked and had dropped, had left a number, some of the material in dangerous places.  In one incident, a child I think had a hand badly injured, after picking up one of these devices.  The result was that the weapons were then left at some sympathetic comrades' homes.  When I went there to pick up the weapons, they then requested of me, to train them in the use of some of the weapons, as they were under attack from Inkatha on a regular basis at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line950"><a name="pos950"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr McBride, can you give us any indication, how many people did you train, two, three?</p>
<p class="line" id="line951"><a name="pos951"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> Four.  Four people sir.</p>

<p class="line" id="line954"><a name="pos954"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was it just what you would call a crash training course?</p>
<p class="line" id="line955"><a name="pos955"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> That is correct yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line956"><a name="pos956"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just one session?</p>
<p class="line" id="line957"><a name="pos957"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> It was maybe about three hours in total, and Welile Khumalo at that stage, initially would continue the training after the Edendale operation with them, because he knew them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line958"><a name="pos958"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you say you supplied them with weapons?  What type of weapons would that have been?</p>
<p class="line" id="line959"><a name="pos959"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> I cannot remember now, sir, but it included handgrenades.</p>
<p class="line" id="line960"><a name="pos960"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Firearms and handgrenades?</p>
<p class="line" id="line961"><a name="pos961"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> I don't recall firearms specifically, but handgrenades, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line962"><a name="pos962"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You can definitely recall handgrenades?</p>
<p class="line" id="line963"><a name="pos963"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> Yes.  And with regard to (h) ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line964"><a name="pos964"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> We will deal with that shortly.  Mr Chairperson, are there any further questions from the Chair on this, on (f)?</p>
<p class="line" id="line965"><a name="pos965"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I don't think so, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line966"><a name="pos966"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Thank you.  Mr McBride, if I may take you again, sorry, now to (h), on page 106.  Again, this is not a count which was dealt with in the preliminary proceeding pages in bundle A1, that we have now traversed and completed.   May I just question you on this, you say here - "in line with ANC leadership decisions and the provisions of the National Peace Accord" you refer to attached documents.  We don't have that attached document, but you say "I was involved in the training, organising and political education of Self Defence Units.  I was also tasked with the responsibility of supplying weapons and communication equipment such as two-way radio's to Self Defence Units.  I was also involved in assisting SDU's with reconnaissance of potential attackers."  Do you recall that aspect in your amnesty application, that you seek amnesty for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line967"><a name="pos967"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line968"><a name="pos968"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Can you deal with that briefly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line969"><a name="pos969"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> Yes.  When I was released from prison in September 1992, I was instructed to work on the ANC's Peace Desk for the Gauteng Province.   I dealt with violence and violence monitoring and the training of paralegals who would monitor violence and take note.  It was at the stage where the apartheid Stage had used its surrogates to massacre township residents.  At that stage, I had witnessed the terror being visited upon the communities by people from the hostels, who identified themselves as Inkatha.  Inkatha members had also said they want to take over the East Rand, the area I was active in and make it their base.  The result was that people were killed every day.  I could not stand by and allow this to happen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line970"><a name="pos970"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> Which people were killed every day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line971"><a name="pos971"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> Township residents were killed by the hostel dwellers.  Every day we would pick up on average 20 bodies, every day.  I could not stand by and let this continue, so I went to a number of comrades including comrade Rashid, comrade Ronnie Kasrils and others, to request weapons and to be given the go-ahead to train people and set up the defence units in the area.   They all agreed and I worked closely with the political leadership in the area, and trained people and armed people to defend themselves.</p>
<p class="line" id="line972"><a name="pos972"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was this mainly in the East Rand, Tokoza, those, Vosloorus, those type places?</p>
<p class="line" id="line973"><a name="pos973"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> In particular those areas.  The whole of Gauteng was my responsibility.</p>
<p class="line" id="line974"><a name="pos974"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And for how long were you involved in this sort of activity?  You have mentioned 1992?</p>
<p class="line" id="line975"><a name="pos975"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> Well, I was mentioned till after the ANC came into power.</p>
<p class="line" id="line976"><a name="pos976"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So from 1992 through to 1994?</p>
<p class="line" id="line977"><a name="pos977"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> 1994, for example I was involved together with the South African Police Services in negotiating an amnesty to hand in weapons, which took place on October the 16th for all defence units, together with former Justice Minister, Omar.  That is the extent.  Until such time that the presidential project was kicked off, it was taken over by the communities themselves, and then I left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line978"><a name="pos978"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> Mr McBride, you say you make application for amnesty for matters raised in paragraph (h)?</p>
<p class="line" id="line979"><a name="pos979"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> Yes sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line980"><a name="pos980"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> What offences would that be?</p>
<p class="line" id="line981"><a name="pos981"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> Possession of weapons and supply of weapons to defence units.</p>
<p class="line" id="line982"><a name="pos982"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> So it will be strictly in terms of the Arms and Ammunitions Act that you apply?</p>
<p class="line" id="line983"><a name="pos983"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> Yes sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line984"><a name="pos984"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And those weapons would include what, firearms, grenades, what sort of weapons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line985"><a name="pos985"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> Yes, mainly grenades, firearms and ammunition.</p>
<p class="line" id="line986"><a name="pos986"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Sorry, do you know if any of those firearms and ammunition were used by the Self Defence Units that you trained?</p>
<p class="line" id="line987"><a name="pos987"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> Oh, they were definitely used, definitely used.  In fact, if it was not for those firearms, the place would have been overrun by the hostel dwellers.  Those firearms helped in defending the community, I am hundred percent sure of that.  In fact President Mandela, when he was briefed on this matter, in and around July 1993, praised the Self Defence Units in speaking at Huntersfield Stadium in Katlehong, for the good work they did in defending communities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line988"><a name="pos988"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Mr Dehal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line989"><a name="pos989"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.  Mr McBride, may I now take you to page 107 of your application for amnesty, perhaps you can look at that bundle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line990"><a name="pos990"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE PILLAY:</span> Before you get there, Mr McBride, paragraph (f), would that be the same?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1012"><a name="pos1012"></a>	"It was accepted both during the trial and later during the hearing held in terms of the Indemnity Act, that the motives for my involvement in all operations for which I was charged, were political, not personal.  At trial I was charged and convicted of attempting to overthrow or endanger State authority in the Republic and to achieve, bring about or promote constitutional, political, industrial and or economic change in the Republic.  The Why Not car bomb operation was carried out on the 14th of June 1986, during a period of extreme political upheaval in South Africa, which had culminated in the declaration of a nation wide state of emergency on June the 12th.  Among other things, the declaration of the state of emergency was an acknowledgement by the then government of the extent of the turmoil in the country.   State of emergency granted unlimited powers to the Security Forces and indemnity from prosecution for acts carried out during this period.  The operation also took place within the context of the ANC's organised political uprising against the minority government of the day.  Within this, it is important to look at the following factors - one year previously to the day, the Security Forces had raided Gaberone in Botswana, killing 12 people, two Botswana citizens, one Somalian, one six year old child from Lesotho and eight South Africans.  Of the South Africans, eight were ANC members, none of them were MK combatants.  The addition of the Setchaba following this attack, the editorial stated the following - the struggle of the people of South Africa will be intensified at all costs.  The time has come when we should avenge our martyrs.  In addition the 1985 conference of the ANC held in Kabwe had decided that the distinction between soft and hard targets should disappear.  An article from Setchaba at the time, outlines some of the reasoning behind this."</p>

The attack on South African refugees in Botswana by the racist Forces, just before the conference, emphasised the need for our movement to bleed the enemy.  On the same theme, the then President of the ANC, Oliver Tambo stated the following in an interview - I will summarise the position taken by the conference in these terms - the struggle must be intensified at all costs.   </p>
<p class="line" id="line1023"><a name="pos1023"></a>	Over the past nine to ten months at least, at the very least, there have been many soft targets hit by the enemy, nearly 500 people had died during that period.  That works out to about 50 per month, massacred, shot down, killed secretly.  All those were very, very soft targets.  They belong to the sphere of the intensification of the struggle.

On behalf of all those who acted under my command, and on behalf of the ANC, I wish to state on record that I truly regret the injury and death that I have caused during the pursuance of the armed struggle, whether directly or indirectly.   </p>
<p class="line" id="line1036"><a name="pos1036"></a>	An issue appeared to have arisen during the evidence given during this hearing, as to why two operations are placed in chapter 5 of the ANC submissions, namely the Klein incident and the Pine Parkade incident.  The explanation inter alia is that all the incidents for which I have been convicted, I had applied for amnesty for.  I did not state these specifically in my application form, but rather refer to my indictment.   Hence, during the compilation of the ANC submissions, the ANC was unable to ascribe responsibility mainly because they did not have my trial records, which included the indictment and wherein these cases were outlined.  Hence, as an administrative error, these were placed elsewhere.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1037"><a name="pos1037"></a>	In any case, all these acts, including these two have been supported by my Commander, Aboobaker Ismail, comrade Rashid.  As will clearly be noted, the versions and attitude on all these operations in my trial evidence, differs from my present evidence.  One of the main reasons for these differences is that during the trial, I was really being tried for my life, and I was facing four charges of murder, five of attempted murder and various other serious charges.   </p>
<p class="line" id="line1038"><a name="pos1038"></a>	My being an ANC member would in itself have aggravated my position in the eyes of the Trial Bench.  If I had testified that I was instructed to carry out the Why Not operation, as now testified by my Commander, comrade Rashid, it is obvious that there would have been no extenuating circumstances found as premeditation would have been common cause, previous MK guerrillas who were tried for cases of murder in which it was established that instructions were given, were convicted and sentenced to death.  They usually were hanged.  In one such case, a person was sentenced to death for what is tantamount to Contempt of Court charge, he had not killed anybody and here I speak of James Maunge.  This was the atmosphere in the country at that time.  I also wanted to protect my organisation by not talking about them and their instructions to me.  Hence I did not refer to instructions during my trial with regard to this operation.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1039"><a name="pos1039"></a>	In addition to this, I as an oppressed person did not feel that there is any moral imperative or onus on me to have to be truthful or honourable with the regime that oppresses me and uses its judiciary to perpetuate discrimination and oppression against me, with unjust laws and unjust people trying me.  The situation is different to the situation I now face in this hearing.  All these operations took place a long time ago.  My recollection therefore suffers as a result.  These operations were carried out under tense conditions and were akin to warlike operations.  For this reason as well, my exact recollection is not always precise."</p>
<p class="line" id="line1040"><a name="pos1040"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Mr McBride, thank you.  May I now take you to some copies that you wish to hand in which deal broadly with the various counts, the political background at the time, the raid by South African Forces on the ANC in exile and the reports in that regard.   Mr Chairperson, I have two sets of documents, one which has three pages, the other which has six pages.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1041"><a name="pos1041"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We will call the one with three pages, M.  Are they three continuous pages, or three pages each dealing with a different article or whatever?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1042"><a name="pos1042"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Mr Chairperson, three individual pages stapled together in one bundle, and six in one bundle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1043"><a name="pos1043"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But is it one story in one bundle, or is  each page self-contained information?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1044"><a name="pos1044"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Each page is separate from the other.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1045"><a name="pos1045"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay, M1 to M3.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1046"><a name="pos1046"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1047"><a name="pos1047"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And the other one N1 through to N6.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1048"><a name="pos1048"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Mr Chairperson, whilst those are being handed around, could I just quickly confer with Mr McBride?  May I continue, Mr Chairperson?  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1049"><a name="pos1049"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that, have you finished now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1050"><a name="pos1050"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Sorry, no.   Mr McBride, these copies, Exhibits M and N have been handed in.  Can you tell us briefly why you sought to have these included?  Sorry, we are having some problems in getting Mr McBride's microphone on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1051"><a name="pos1051"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just try putting yours off first and then try putting it on while - let me get mine off as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1052"><a name="pos1052"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1053"><a name="pos1053"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> Yes, the main reason I wish to hand these two exhibits in is to show that different criteria are applied by the same people, in particular in this case, the media which was regarded as the mouthpiece of the government in those days, which was actually started up by stolen government funds when dealing with my case and when dealing with activities of the apartheid Forces in which people were killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1054"><a name="pos1054"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Thank you.  Mr McBride, you want to now refer I understand to the injured and deceased persons generally and I believe you want to make a statement in that regard.  May I help you, if you look at 6 or 7 and 8 of A1, therein lies the names.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1055"><a name="pos1055"></a><span class="speaker">MR McBRIDE:</span> At this moment I particularly want to speak to the families of the people whose deaths I have caused, in particular Ms Buthelezi, the mother of Mlungize Buthelezi and the Buthelezi family, the family and relatives of Angelique Pattendon, the family and relatives of Julie van der Linde and the family and relatives of Marchelle Gerrard and the family and relatives of all people of who I had caused injury to.  I am truly sorry for causing the deaths of your loved ones, I had nothing personal against them.  It was in a quest for my own freedom and a quest to unshackle myself from the apartheid system that I brought about the deaths of your loved ones.  For this I am sorry.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1056"><a name="pos1056"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> Mr Chairperson, that would appear to conclude Mr McBride's evidence.  I see it is about three minutes to four, there may be aspects that I have omitted, I have various annexures that were photocopied, could we perhaps adjourn at this stage and I could confer with him, than wasting any more time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1057"><a name="pos1057"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, I think it would be a convenient time to adjourn and Mr Richard would it be possible for you to get those missing volumes that you require.  Mr Dehal, would you still require them, but perhaps if Mr Richard could get what he requires from the trial record which was mentioned earlier for this evening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1058"><a name="pos1058"></a><span class="speaker">MR DEHAL:</span> I have no difficulties.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1059"><a name="pos1059"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Mr Richard, would you just link up with Mr Dehal?  Thank you.  Yes, we will now adjourn until half past nine tomorrow morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1060"><a name="pos1060"></a><span class="speaker">MR RICHARD:</span> I may mention, it seems as if Mr Dehal went and did the homework I wanted to do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1061"><a name="pos1061"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you, so we will adjourn until half past nine tomorrow morning, when we will continue with the evidence of Mr McBride, commencing with giving Mr Berger an opportunity to put questions.</p>
