<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, perhaps it might be convenient to recall Mr Wasserman at this stage.  His application, you will recall is in bundle 2, from page 112 onwards Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">LAURIE WASSERMAN:</span> (still under oath)</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR VISSER:</span> (continued)  Mr Wasserman, you gave evidence previously in these hearings, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And you took the oath to speak the truth previously, do you consider yourself still bound to speak the truth in terms of the previous oath that you took?</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I do Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Wasserman we are not going to rehash or revisit the evidence which you already gave in regard to the political situation and political objectives.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a>	Can we go straight to the incident regarding Ndwandwe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> We can Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Now, you have heard the evidence of the previous witnesses.  Will you briefly tell the Committee where you came into it, and what your part was first in the abduction and through to the end of the incident where Ms Ndwandwe was eliminated and buried?</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Well Mr Chairman, I accompanied all the names that had been mentioned so far to the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Wasserman, can you just speak up a little bit please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I accompanied the persons and personalities that had been mentioned by the previous applicants to this house at Onverwacht.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a>	Later, we all had our responsibilities from there, we knew what they were.  I then proceeded with the bakkie through Lavumisa border post.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Which border post is that, we have heard of ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Oh, on the South African side it is called Culel, the Swazi side it is Lavumisa, it is the same post.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I am sorry, I don't know whether I am the only one that is confused, but I have heard of a border post Culel and the other one is Onverwacht.  Which of the two did you enter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It is Culel, but it is also Lavumisa, it is the same place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well, let's just stick to what we know, Culel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> (Microphone not on)</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes Mr Chairman, but it becomes very confusing on the record, when suddenly one refers to different names of people and places where we know which ones we have been referring to so far.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I will refer to Culel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> If you could just stick to the names that we have been using so far.  Please continue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> All right Mr Chairman, so from there, I proceeded up towards Manzini where I waited on Culel/Manzini road.  Later on I met up with Du Preez.  At that point where we met, is where the two informers were handed their bakkie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What were the two of you travelling in at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, at that stage I was alone in the bakkie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Du Preez?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Du Preez?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Du Preez was in the minibus.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> In the minibus?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> In the minibus, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Kombi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Kombi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> It was actually a panel van Mr Chairman, but we will call it a kombi.  All right, and you say there you handed the bakkie to the two informers, and what did you do, get into the kombi with Du Preez?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And what happened then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> We then proceeded into Manzini and took up a surveillance position.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Behind or in front of the bakkie?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> In front of the bakkie, which was in the vicinity of the entrance to the George Hotel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What time of the day was this approximately?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I would estimate it now between 17H00 and 18H00 Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Between five o'clock and six o'clock in the afternoon, all right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Continue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> We were informed by radio that the subject, Ms Ndwandwe had arrived and had entered the bakkie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Who informed you by radio?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It was Mr Botha sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And he was where?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> They were in a position behind the bakkie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> In Taylor's vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> All right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Sorry to interrupt the course of things Mr Visser, but you said that you wouldn't want to lead all the evidence once again, in order to expedite matters, is there any reason why you are coming back to this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, yes, I certainly am not doing this because I think that I  have nothing else to do.  I am just wondering whether this witness shouldn't at least tell you what his participation was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a>	Perhaps I can go a little quicker, thank you for the indication Mr Chairman.  Perhaps if I may then just lead you, is it true that at some stage, Ms Ndwandwe got into the bakkie with the two informers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That the bakkie then left Manzini and travelled towards the Big Bend?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you follow them or did you go ahead of them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> We were ahead Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Ahead, and Taylor with his vehicle and occupants followed from behind the bakkie?</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Is it also correct that some distance away as Mr Forster had testified, the vehicles came to a standstill and Ndwandwe was transferred from the bakkie into the kombi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> From there, with which vehicle did you travel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I was in the bakkie Mr Chairman, no, I was in the kombi, the kombi bus Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> In the kombi?  Mr Botha and Mr Forster said that it was raining that day, is that your recollection?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And that on the way to Hluti, the vehicles came to a standstill and Botha and Ndwandwe got onto the back of the bakkie, covered with a tarpaulin and where did you then, which vehicle did you then alight?</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I then took charge and drove the 4 x 4, the bakkie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You drove the bakkie and who was with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Du Preez in the front.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Du Preez.  The other two vehicles left and exited at Culel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Where did you then go, did you go passed Hluti and where?</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I proceeded to a point on the fence line, on the border fence line where Mr Botha and Ms Ndwandwe were handed over.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did they climb through the fence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And who was on the other side?</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> There was Mr Taylor and Mr Steyn, and Mr Forster.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> All right, what did you then do, you and Du Preez I should ask?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> The Culel border post was closed, so we continued along the southern road of Swaziland.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you go back to Manzini?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> And headed into Manzini, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you stay over in Manzini that evening, that night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> We only got there in the early hours of the next morning, but we did stay over in Manzini, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> There seems to be a suggestion that there was a burglary in a house where Ms Ndwandwe was living and that money was taken.  If it is suggested that either you or Du Preez or you and Du Preez did that, what would you say about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I deny that emphatically Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you know where she lived?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, she had various houses, she was very difficult to find at any set stage.  I wouldn't have known exactly where she would have even kept that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> If you wanted to go and find her at her house, you say you wouldn't have known where to go?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Not instantly Mr Chairman, one would have to mount a little bit of an operation around it, but not instantly, she had various addresses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  You exited the next day, is that correct from Swaziland?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I want to ask you, did you enter and exit Swaziland, you, yourself on valid passports and travel documents?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, I had a false South African passport.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And Du Preez?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> A false South African passport as well Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And you entered and exited both ways, on the false passports?</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What did you do after you had exited at Culel the next, I am sorry, where did you exit the next morning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> We exited at Culel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> At Culel, and where did you then go?</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> We proceeded to the house at Onverwacht border post.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, where you found Steyn and Botha and Forster and Ms Ndwandwe, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you participate in her interrogation at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, not Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And thereafter, you left for a farm in the Elandskop area in Pietermaritzburg, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> With which vehicle did you travel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> In the minibus.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> The kombi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> The kombi bus.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And was Botha and Ndwandwe also in the kombi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Was anybody talking to her, interrogating her during the trip from Swaziland to Pietermaritzburg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Botha was having discussions with her in the kombi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  Did you listen to the contents of those discussions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I was unable to listen due to the aboarding between the front and the back, I couldn't hear the conversation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> After arriving at the farm, at Pietermaritzburg, did you there participate in any interrogation of Ndwandwe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I took part in some questioning of Ms Ndwandwe Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Was she assaulted at any time during her interrogations where you were present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, she was not Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> All right.  Did you know what the decision was in her regard, what was going to happen to her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I was aware of the situation in that regard Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> When did you become aware?</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> From the outset Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> From the outset?  And eventually it transpired that she would not, she was not willing to cooperate with the police and certain orders were given?</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> As far as you are concerned, what were those orders?</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I was asked by Mr Taylor, to eliminate Ms Ndwandwe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, would you just tell us what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> He told me that it was really now, Du Preez and I took her outside of the house, to where the grave had been dug previously.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> By whom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> By Du Preez and myself sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> All right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> We took her outside, the grave was about 60 metres from the house's verandah.  Once she was outside, just beyond the verandah, I rendered her unconscious with a heavy blow.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Using?</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Using a wooden riot baton, police riot baton.</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Police baton, all right.  Did you then carry her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> She was immediately unconscious and Du Preez and I then carried her to the grave that was dug in amongst the trees.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you take her clothes off?</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> We then placed Ms Ndwandwe in the grave, half way, sort of half way in.  I then fired a single shot into her head.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> From here, she was dead.  We then undressed her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Why was that done?</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> For clothing and identification purposes.  Clothing could be identified at a later stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you then place her in the bottom of the grave?</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> We then placed her in the bottom of the grave and began to fill it in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What with Mr Wasserman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> First put in a layer of some white lime, some building type lime.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Why was that done?</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That takes away any smell through the soil for wild animals or for smelling purposes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Before you placed that over the body, did you also place some plastic bags or agricultural bags over the body?</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, that was done slightly at a later stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> All right, please continue.  You then started filling in, is that what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, there was first the lime and then filled up and then some rubbish bags were placed in on top.</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Refuse bags?</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Refuse bags, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> All right.  Anything else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> The bags were there should anybody have a look or see anything indentations in that area, one would presume it was a little bit of a dump there Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, and would then hopefully stop digging?</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> And hopefully avoid it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You were also involved in the matter of Cele?</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Which was very, as the Honourable Chairman has pointed out, a very similar situation to the present one, the one of Ndwandwe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> When you say refuse bags, does it include also refuse that was placed somewhere as a layer over the grave?</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I can't recall that explicitly, but there would have been some refuse in the bag, I would imagine sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> When the - after the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act was passed, you decided to apply for amnesty and is it correct that you did afford your cooperation to the Investigation Unit of the TRC in order to assist them inter alia in pointing out the place, the spot, where she was buried?  I am referring to bundle 4 Mr Chairman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And there is in bundle 4, at page 452, there is a diagram indicating the direction of the travel of the projectile which killed Ms Ndwandwe in the right hand top corner and the right hand bottom corner?</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I see that Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Would that accord with your recollection of how you fired the shot into her head?</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> After you had completed that, and the grave had been filled in, what did you then do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Myself and Du Preez returned to the house sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And you then left?</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Am I correct in assuming then that you did not, you were not part of the decision makers in regard to this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You followed orders, but you agreed with the contents of the orders?</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> For reasons which you already told the Committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you know Mr Labuschagne and Mr Verwey?</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I do know them sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And you noticed them there that day, questioning Ms Ndwandwe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Were they present at the time when she was murdered?</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Not at all Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Wasserman, you were also involved in the elimination of Mr Pumeso Nxiweni, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And if I understand correctly, you arrived on the afternoon of the 5th of November 1988, with Taylor at the safe house at Verulam?</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Where you discovered Nxiweni being held by Botha, Van der Westhuizen and Du Preez?</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Will you please tell the Committee what transpired after you had arrived?</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> At a later stage, I didn't have any questions to ask Mr Nxiweni.  Later on myself, Mr Botha and Mr Du Preez left for the Allan Taylor residence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did Du Preez tell you to come along?</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And what did, is it correct that you lifted a DLB at the Allan Taylor residence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Was this DLB, let me rather approach this differently, did you know Nxiweni before that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you know of activities allegedly participated by him in, in which he participated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  We heard of an Allan Taylor unit.  Can you tell the Committee as far as you know, what names you can connect to what you referred to as the Allan Taylor unit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, there is some confusion here about the Allan Taylor unit.  An awful lot of MK, military MK activity was emanating from Allan Taylor unit.  I am unable to always specifically state who was in which unit and where, but Pumeso Nxiweni was a prevalent Commander of Allan Taylor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  And is it your experience also that some of the members of units, were active in more than one unit at any one time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is Allan Taylor?</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, it is the medical residential quarters for the University of Natal.  It is like a hostel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And I presume it would change from year to year, the people staying there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, that would be correct sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you would have a constant turn over of people there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Very much so sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You were about to tell us that you went with Botha to the Allan Taylor residence, and who else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Du Preez.</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Du Preez, all right, and we know that you lifted, well, what did you find there, perhaps you should tell us in your own words?</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> We went into a store room and found a metal trunk, which we were familiar with, it was the kind of trunk that we were familiar with when it came to DLB's and we opened it and found some explosives inside that trunk.</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> All right.  Do you know what happened to those explosives which, to the contents of that DLB later?</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, they were in the control of Mr Botha, I don't know what happened with them after that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  When you went back, or did you go back to the safe house at Verulam?</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What did you find when you arrived there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Taylor had already commenced to dig a grave outside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did he commence to dig the grave, or had he dug the grave?</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It was almost dug Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, and where was Pumeso?</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> He was still, he was at the safe house Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> At the safe house, or in the safe house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> In the safe house Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Was there anyone with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> If I recall correctly, Mr Van der Westhuizen was still there Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> All right, so what happened thereafter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Taylor sent Van der Westhuizen and Botha away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Away where?</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I don't know Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did they leave the premises?</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> They left the premises.</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> All right, and you, Du Preez and Taylor remained behind?</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What happened then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Du Preez and I then led Mr Nxiweni out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Didn't Taylor tell you anything?</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Taylor said yes, we must eliminate Mr Nxiweni.</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> All right, he gave you the order?</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And you say you and Du Preez then led Mr Nxiweni out,yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> To a point close to the grave.</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Du Preez then shot him a single shot in the head.</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Was Pumeso not rendered unconscious as had been the case with Ndwandwe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Not on this occasion at all, no, he was not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Was Pumeso standing, sitting or laying when Du Preez shot him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> He was standing Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And where on his body, was he shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> He was shot on the side of his head Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Which side?  If you can't remember,just say so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I can't remember automatically.</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> But I can see on the papers, if you show me the paper, I can remember it.  I don't know if it was on the left temple or the right temple.</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> But he was shot in the temple?</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did he fall down?</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you take his clothes off?</p>

<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you also put lime over the body there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Refuse bags?</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I don't recall refuse bags Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Was this during the day or the night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> This was night time.</p>

<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What happened to the clothes both of Ndwandwe as well as that of Pumeso?</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> We burnt the clothes on both occasions Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Both occasions?  Mr Wasserman, you heard the evidence as to why Mr Pumeso was killed, why it was thought necessary to eliminate him.  Do you agree with that evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, I concur with the evidence given to the Committee thus far.</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Were you also aware of the information regarding Mr Nxiweni, which was received from Ms Ndwandwe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I was aware Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And were you convinced of the truth of what it was alleged that he was involved with as far as MK operations were concerned, in Natal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct Mr Chairman.</p>

<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, my activities concur with that, with the evidence given by Mr Botha.  The use of informer there, the capture of the members of the unit on the Avoca Bridge and the transporting thereof, to the safe house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Were you involved with those informers who penetrated and gained their confidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I was not Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Who was the one who was involved, whose informers were they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I think Mr Botha was the handler,  I think.</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I see.  All right, the fact is that there was an arrest made for want of a better word, at the Avoca Bridge?</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you have knowledge of a report that they were under way to blow up the railway line at Phoenix?</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Railway station, all right, and what happened with them, after they were arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> They were taken through to the safe house at Verulam Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> At Verulam?</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What transpired there Mr Wasserman?  First of all, were they found in possession of anything?</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, on their arrest they had limpet mines with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Limpet mines.  Can you remember how many?</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I recall three Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> How many people did you arrest there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Three Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Were they Mr Ndlovu, Mr Vilakazi and Mr Mtshali?</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you know them before?</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I didn't know them personally, I knew of them Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you know of their activities?</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And that it was alleged that they played a significant role in MK terror operations in Port Natal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> So, at the safe house at Verulam, anything that happened there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, we spoke to them, separated them and spoke to them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Were they assaulted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you assault anyone?</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, I did Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Whom did you assault?</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I don't recall which of the three I assaulted Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> One of the tree?</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I spoke to all three on occasions Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Could you have assaulted all three of them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It is possible Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What was the purpose of assaulting them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, we had information they were on their way to go and do a military operation and I wanted a little bit more facts, very quickly, so I beat them just to make sure that I was going to get what I needed, in time, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> How did you assault them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I would have slapped and punched Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Slapped with the open hand?</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> And with my fists Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Where on the body of these persons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It would have been to the face, the ears, the chest Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And were they punched in the face as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did they give an explanation about the limpet mines which you found in their possession?</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Well, I was informed that they were to be used on that evening's military operation Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, but in your interrogation, did the kwaMashu 3 give an explanation of their possession of the three limpet mines, that you can remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, not specifically to me was it made, however, I recall being informed that the military weaponry had come from Nxiweni.</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> All right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did anybody say that they had been left with them, and they were going to throw them away?</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Not to me Mr Chairman, I did hear that later though sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> All right, so what transpired thereafter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> After that, Mr Taylor arrived at the safe house Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Could you just speak up a little bit Mr Wasserman, I find it extremely difficult to hear you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Taylor arrived at the safe house Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did he take over?</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did he give instructions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Instructions were then given.</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What did he say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> These persons, this unit, was to be taken out to the scene where they were going to do their military activity.</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And eliminated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> And eliminated at the scene and it was to look as though they had had a mishap in the handling of their own explosives.</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, and is that what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is what happened Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you go out to the scene?</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I did Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Accompanied by?</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Taylor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Botha?</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Botha, myself and Mr Du Preez.</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> All right, Mr Botha gave evidence to say that Taylor remained in the car with these three persons.  I am sorry, just bear a moment with me Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a>	I repeat, is it correct that when you arrived there, Mr Taylor remained in the car with the three persons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It is correct Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And you went somewhere?</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What did you go and do and where did you go?</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Went to a point on the railway line not too far from Phoenix railway station Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Du Preez, myself and Botha each had a member of this unit under our control.</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You escorted them to this point?</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> We escorted them to the point on the railway line Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And what happened there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Well, at this point, each one of us had control of a member of the unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Which one did you have control of or don't you remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I don't remember Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, and?</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> At a sign from Mr Botha, we each shot the one that we were responsible for, once in the head Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Just how did this happen?  First of all, was it during the day or at night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, it was dark, it was night time Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Dark?  Were they standing up when they were shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, they were on haunches Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did someone or all of you, instruct them to sit down?</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And to do what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I just said merely, you know, sit down Mr Chairman, I didn't tell them to do anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Was it light enough so that you could see around you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, it was Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And you say there was a sign by Botha?</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> There was a nodding of the head Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, and you then said that they were all shot, all three of them, with a single shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Initially all shot with a single shot, with I had a Scorpion with a silencer on Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And the others, did they use firearms with or without silencers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> All silenced weapons Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And after you had shot, the three of you had shot one shot into the heads of the victims, what happened then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, then they were placed upon...</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> First of all, did you fire only one shot into the heads?</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Oh no, Mr Chairman, I fired a second shot into my victim.</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And the others?</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> They also did, to my recollection.</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> To your recollection?  All right, they were then placed you said, just continue?</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> They were then placed on top of an explosive device, their explosive devices that they had when we arrested them that evening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What part of their bodies were placed on the explosive device, on the limpet mines?</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> The hands and head sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And what was the purpose of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> The explosion would render their identities, make them unidentifiable Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, and the fact that they were shot in the head?</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Are you an explosives expert?</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Who prepared the limpet mines for the explosion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It was done by Mr Du Preez sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> All right, and did you then leave?</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And did you hear the report of the limpet mines detonating?</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you take part at all in their interrogation or should I rather ask this, was your interrogation of these three directed at attempting to persuade them to become informers on this occasion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Why was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, I had no, I never ever thought that they would even think about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Becoming informers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> About working with the State,yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Sorry, just before you proceed, did you not say that you didn't know any one of them personally?</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I didn't know any one of them personally, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You simply knew of activities in which they were involved?</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So why did you think that they would not be prepared to become informers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I wasn't going to try and turn them Mr Chairman, it wasn't my area of responsibility in the first place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> If I heard you correctly, you were saying that you never, ever thought that they would become informers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> In my brief association with the parties involved, there was no time Mr Chairman, to make an assessment on that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Was there no time, or was it not the objective?</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It certainly wasn't my objective Mr Chairman, I don't know about other members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You never considered that, that is really what it comes to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So you cannot say that you never, ever thought that they would become informers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well, on that point, what was your experience about more than one person being together and being able to be convinced to become informers?  Was that easier or more difficult?</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, that is exactly the difficult starting point Mr Chairman.  Should three persons be captured together, one will find that it is most difficult to try and turn or make informers of persons in that situation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Sorry, why didn't you charge them?   Why were they not charged if they were found with the limpet mines?</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I am unable to, the decision wouldn't have been mine, and I am unable to pass comment on that Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You followed orders?</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  Apart from the evidence which you gave regarding political situation and the political objectives relating to this incident, did you also hear the evidence of Mr Botha?</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I did Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And that of Mr Steyn?</p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I did Mr Steyn.</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And do you also make common cause with what they stated in that regard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I do sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR VISSER</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOLTE:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, I have no questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a>NO CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR NOLTE</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY ADV PRIOR:</span> Thank you, Prior on behalf of the Amnesty Committee, Evidence Leader, and also standing in for Mr Ngubane, on behalf of the victims.</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a>	Mr Chairman, with your leave I will start with the kwaMashu 3 and then work backwards, those are freshest, if it will not inconvenience anyone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a>	Mr Wasserman, what would have happened to you if you had said to Mr Botha, look, I don't want part of this, I don't want to follow this order?</p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I would imagine my days on the Intelligence gathering unit, might have been numbered.</p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Do you think he would have sidelined you or had you transferred?</p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes  Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> In order to keep your employment with that unit, you decided to carry out this unlawful command?</p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, once the command was evident to me, I also accepted it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> So it wasn't just a question of following orders, you made common cause or made common purpose with what was going down there, what was happening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> It wasn't so much the order that moved you, as the activity of your unit?  You were killing operatives at that stage, that was the strategy, is that not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It was one finger on the fist Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Well, you had these people dead to sites, you had them with mini limpet mines, you could have charged them, they would have got at least six, seven, eight years possibly, taken out of circulation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Would that have been quite a thing to put together, an investigation in the light of the acquittals of Bhila and Nxiweni in Ramlakan?</p>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, I don't think so Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> It was simply expedient for your purposes or your unit's purposes, to eliminate them as you did?</p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No Mr Chairman, it was part of the fight against the military fight that was waging at the time, some could be handled by Courts, other actions just didn't seem so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And as decided by the Durban branch of the Security Police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> As decided by my command structure, at least I know that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Taylor at Botha?</p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> At least I know of my command structure, yes sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> The evidence of Mr Forster and of Mr Botha, was that primarily the task or the object was always information gathering.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> You have been asked this by a member of the panel.  Can you think of any reason given your experience, background, in the field, why even an attempt was not made to try and turn these, the kwaMashu 3?</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, I don't know if the other parties did try to turn any of these personalities.  In my presence it didn't occur.</p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a>	I don't know amongst themselves, if they tried.  But also it gets to the point of when there are three picked up, if one agreed, the other two would be in the way, so  that is the difficulty in this particular instance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Do you know how they were arrested or picked up, in other words what plan or what legend was created?</p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, I was briefed to meet my unit, and we were to effect the capture on the Avoca Bridge Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Did it appear to you as if they were waiting for people that they knew?  In other words a rendezvous?</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> So they expected to meet comrades, was that part of the plan?</p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I don't know what they were told, whether it was to be comrades or finances or somebody, but they were to meet somebody.</p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And those informers, were they present on that occasion, or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And you said those informers were handled by Mr Botha?</p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I think that is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> You don't know if they are the same people in the Ndwandwe matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I don't know that Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> You say you had a Scorpion pistol, who issued you that weapon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It was the ANC's weapon Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Where did you, where did you obtain it from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I obtained it from an ANC DLB that was lifted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Was that the one at Allan Taylor as you say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No Mr Chairman.  We lifted hundreds of DLB's, I can't recall which one this one came from.</p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Did you simply keep those weapons under your control, that is the Security Branch, Durban, to use whenever you felt like it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> So those weapons would not necessarily have been handed in through the official channels?</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And the other persons, Botha and Du Preez, what were they armed with, similar weapons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It was also Scorpions yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Also silenced?</p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Also silenced, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> If we can just go now to Pumeso Nxiweni.  This Allan Taylor unit, you say all you can recall is that Nxiweni was the Overall Commander?</p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Round about this stage, yes Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> You can't remember anybody else that possibly was a member?</p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, I would be wrong to just add up names, I can't recall names right now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> If it was suggested to you that the Allan Taylor unit broke up at the time of the trial or the arrest of the accused in the Ramlakan matter and was never regrouped, what would your comment be?</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I would doubt that very much Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Although you don't have any information about specific persons who were actually members during 1987 and 1989?</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No Mr Chairman, I can't recall that portion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And you worked closely with Mr Botha, did you not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I did Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> So it was virtually, it would have come to your attention had there been active members, other than Nxiweni involved at Allan Taylor?</p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No Mr Chairman, there definitely were active members, there definitely were, I just can't recall the names.</p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> During the arrests of the accused involved in the Ramlakan trial, was a DLB also discovered at Allan Taylor?</p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, I actually can't recall specifically but there were weapons recovered, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And I understand standard procedure for example a container, that would be dusted for prints?</p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> I mean that is written in the book?</p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> On this occasion, after the arrest of Nxiweni, you discovered a DLB at the Allan Taylor residence, in a storage room?</p>
<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Was that dusted for prints?</p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, not at all Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Against procedure?</p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Against procedure Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And we have gone through this with the other applicants, there was a golden opportunity to prosecute Nxiweni and have him removed out of circulation for a number of years, on the strength of the ammunition and explosives and that DLB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, I heard that evidence given.</p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Can you maybe advance a reason why there was this departure from the normal practice?</p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No Mr Chairman, I have to concur with the evidence given previously by the other applicants.</p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Unless the decision was already to eliminate Nxiweni, and not to bother about investigating any charges against him?  That would seem to fit the scenario, would it not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I am unaware of that particular setup as you are outlining it now Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line546"><a name="pos546"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> It seems to my mind that Nxiweni was unlikely to be a person to be turned, I am talking about 1988?  Would you agree?</p>
<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I agree Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line548"><a name="pos548"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Can we then accept that the only reason why Nxiweni was then detained or arrested, was for purposes of his elimination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I am unable to answer that Mr Chairman, my Commanders would have to answer that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Well, what was your sense, you worked very close to Botha?  I mean surely he would have discussed with you what the strategy would be, would have been?</p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Sorry, there is too much noise from down here, I couldn't hear anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> I will repeat it.  I just get a sense from replies that I have heard today and over the last couple of days, that everyone seemed to just have their own agenda.  Surely Botha would have discussed with you what was to happen with Nxiweni, that there was a plan to have him arrested and once he was arrested or detained or abducted, whatever the position was, whether to prosecute him, to turn him or whatever?</p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, when this gentleman was arrested, I wasn't even in this country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Where were you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I was away, I was in Swaziland.  So, I wasn't aware of this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> All right.  The weapon you used to kill Mr Nxiweni, what was that?  Was it also a Scorpion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I never shot Mr Nxiweni.</p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Mr Du Preez shot him, you were together, acting together?</p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Scorpion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> It was a Scorpion, and he was only shot once?</p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> It seems from the post mortem report at page 510, in bundle 4 Mr Chairman, one sees the entry wound on the left side of the skull, probably just behind the left ear and exiting on the right hand side.</p>
<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I see that and concur with that Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Was he shot from very close range?</p>
<p class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line566"><a name="pos566"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Was it almost a contact shot or can't you say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It was very, very close indeed Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line568"><a name="pos568"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> What, a few inches or a few millimetres or a few centimetres?</p>
<p class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line570"><a name="pos570"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> He was laying, standing, seated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> He was standing Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Was lime also, I think you said that, all right, just one other aspect, you said Taylor had begun or had started to dig the grave for Nxiweni?</p>
<p class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Himself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Himself, yes Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> That is what he said in his amnesty application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I don't know what he said in his amnesty application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Was it unusual that he should have dug the grave?</p>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, not when you knew Mr Taylor, Mr Chairman, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> I want to deal with Fila Ndwandwe's incident.  This was a, the foray into Swaziland was a well planned operation, was it not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Given the evidence we have heard today, General Steyn, et al Mr Botha over the last few days, would I be correct in understanding that the planning was such that the risk of things going wrong, was reduced to a very, very bare minimum?</p>
<p class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes Mr Chairman, that is right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And obviously you people didn't want to spend any more time than you had to, in Swaziland, after the abduction of Ms Ndwandwe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line585"><a name="pos585"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line586"><a name="pos586"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And I would also like to believe that you would have planned the whole operation that you would have been able to return before the border post closed at ten o'clock on the same day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> We had planned that Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line588"><a name="pos588"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> In other words, you left yourself sufficient time to get back to the border post, to exit Swaziland?</p>
<p class="line" id="line589"><a name="pos589"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> It would be dangerous to remain back in Swaziland, particularly if word had got out that she had been abducted by the Security Branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Well, it wouldn't have been ideal to be there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Precisely.  Now, what time did you get to the border fence, that was where obviously you had got through a hole in the fence or whatever, the fence was cut or whatever it was, near Onverwacht.  What time was that approximately?</p>
<p class="line" id="line593"><a name="pos593"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Half past eight, 9 o'clock Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line594"><a name="pos594"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> That seems to be Colonel Forster's recollection as well.  Now from there to Culel, or to Lavumisa, which is on the Swazi side, how far is that approximately by vehicle?  Less than 50 kilometres?</p>
<p class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line596"><a name="pos596"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> About 30?</p>
<p class="line" id="line597"><a name="pos597"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> About 30 Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line598"><a name="pos598"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Would it have taken you more than an hour and a half to leave Onverwacht where you had dropped off Botha and Ndwandwe to get back to Lavumisa, to travel that distance to the border post?</p>
<p class="line" id="line599"><a name="pos599"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, it was very, very wet, the road was very muddy, that is why only the vehicle, the 4 x 4 could continue.  To go back on that same broken road, the road was pretty mushed up from merely getting there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line600"><a name="pos600"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> All right, just look at page 443 of bundle 4.  You were in the vicinity where the road that looks like a dirt road, crosses the border, is that correct, the international line?</p>
<p class="line" id="line601"><a name="pos601"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line602"><a name="pos602"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> So would you have driven back to the crossroad with Hluti?</p>
<p class="line" id="line603"><a name="pos603"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line604"><a name="pos604"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And then you would have turned to the south towards Lavumisa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line605"><a name="pos605"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Well, that is the road that you are discussing now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line606"><a name="pos606"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> You said you couldn't go along the dirt road, because it was too mushy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line607"><a name="pos607"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, that is right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line608"><a name="pos608"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Because of the weather?  So which road did you go, which road did you follow?</p>
<p class="line" id="line609"><a name="pos609"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> We went the other way, heading to Hlangano.</p>
<p class="line" id="line610"><a name="pos610"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> So you went further away from Onverwacht?</p>
<p class="line" id="line611"><a name="pos611"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line612"><a name="pos612"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Right, you went to Hlangano and then where, did you turn up towards where?</p>
<p class="line" id="line613"><a name="pos613"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Then up to Hlatikulu, that is all tarred road now sir.  Hlatikulu, and then up towards Manzini and then back the other way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line614"><a name="pos614"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> So even though you had a 4 x 4 vehicle, you didn't want to travel the 30 kilometres to Culel, but went via a ...(indistinct) route?</p>
<p class="line" id="line615"><a name="pos615"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It is not a ...(indistinct) route Mr Chairman,it is the right way to go.  I did know the area, I was from there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line616"><a name="pos616"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Did you tell Mr Botha that you were going to take this route back and you wouldn't be able to get back before the border post closed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line617"><a name="pos617"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> We knew once we had done the handover, we were not going to get back in time for the border.</p>
<p class="line" id="line618"><a name="pos618"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Did you tell him, that is the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line619"><a name="pos619"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, I told him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line620"><a name="pos620"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> So he was aware that he wouldn't see you that evening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line621"><a name="pos621"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> He was aware.</p>
<p class="line" id="line622"><a name="pos622"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> You say it was difficult, it would have been difficult to find out where Ms Ndwandwe lived.  Mr Botha's evidence was that you had her address?</p>
<p class="line" id="line623"><a name="pos623"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> We had a couple of her addresses, but you couldn't tell where she would be on Monday night, or which one on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line624"><a name="pos624"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> At Onverwacht, did you take part in any interrogation of her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line625"><a name="pos625"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, I didn't Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line626"><a name="pos626"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> What was her condition when you saw her at Onverwacht the next morning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line627"><a name="pos627"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> She was relaxed, she was fine Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line628"><a name="pos628"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Was she handcuffed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line629"><a name="pos629"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I can't recall that, no, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line630"><a name="pos630"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Would she have been, surely she would have been restrained in case she tried to escape?</p>
<p class="line" id="line631"><a name="pos631"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, at Onverwacht, at the border post?</p>
<p class="line" id="line632"><a name="pos632"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> At the safe house, where she spent the evening with the others?</p>
<p class="line" id="line633"><a name="pos633"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, I can't recall if she was handcuffed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line634"><a name="pos634"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Was she shackled?</p>
<p class="line" id="line635"><a name="pos635"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line636"><a name="pos636"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> With foot shackles?</p>
<p class="line" id="line637"><a name="pos637"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line638"><a name="pos638"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> She never complained to you about anything?</p>
<p class="line" id="line639"><a name="pos639"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line640"><a name="pos640"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> She seemed calm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line641"><a name="pos641"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> She was calm Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line642"><a name="pos642"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> She wasn't complaining about her predicament?</p>
<p class="line" id="line643"><a name="pos643"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> She didn't complain to me about her predicament at all Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line644"><a name="pos644"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Did you travel with her back to Pietermaritzburg, in the same vehicle that is?</p>
<p class="line" id="line645"><a name="pos645"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I was in the same vehicle, but in the front with Mr Du Preez.</p>
<p class="line" id="line646"><a name="pos646"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And was she being interrogated in that vehicle or was not much said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line647"><a name="pos647"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, they were talking in the back of the vehicle Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line648"><a name="pos648"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Having a discussion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line649"><a name="pos649"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Questions and answers, the vehicle is blocked off.  The driver cannot see, the front crew cannot see into the back Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line650"><a name="pos650"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> So you don't know what occurred in the back there, apart from that you heard a discussion of sorts?</p>
<p class="line" id="line651"><a name="pos651"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line652"><a name="pos652"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And you can't tell us whether she gave any important information up or not, over that period?</p>
<p class="line" id="line653"><a name="pos653"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I was briefed on that when we got to the Maritzburg farm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line654"><a name="pos654"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> At Pietermaritzburg, how long did she spend at that safe house, sorry, on the farm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line655"><a name="pos655"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> She was there all the time Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line656"><a name="pos656"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Until what time, what time was she taken out, was it in the early evening to be killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line657"><a name="pos657"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It was already dark Mr Chairman, I would say 19H00, 20H00.</p>
<p class="line" id="line658"><a name="pos658"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And at that safe house, were you there most of the day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line659"><a name="pos659"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I was, most of the day, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line660"><a name="pos660"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Did you interrogate her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line661"><a name="pos661"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line662"><a name="pos662"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Did Du Preez interrogate her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line663"><a name="pos663"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line664"><a name="pos664"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Well, who interrogated her?  Do you know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line665"><a name="pos665"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Botha Mr Chairman, and Mr Steyn, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line666"><a name="pos666"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Did you see that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line667"><a name="pos667"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I looked in the room, Mr Chairman, yes, I saw them talking with her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line668"><a name="pos668"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> From time to time, you would pop in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line669"><a name="pos669"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is exactly right Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line670"><a name="pos670"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> For what purpose?</p>
<p class="line" id="line671"><a name="pos671"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> To hear how things were going, and to listen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line672"><a name="pos672"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Did you also pop in from time to time when Mr Labuschagne and Mr Verwey were interrogating her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line673"><a name="pos673"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, I did Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line674"><a name="pos674"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> This must have been an intense interrogation?  I mean you had a dangerous terrorist in your custody?</p>
<p class="line" id="line675"><a name="pos675"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> What are you trying to say Mr Chairman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line676"><a name="pos676"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Just answer the question, was it an intense interrogation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line677"><a name="pos677"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line678"><a name="pos678"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Was it a casual interrogation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line679"><a name="pos679"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> By the evening stage, I think it was casual to my mind, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line680"><a name="pos680"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> She had been interrogated virtually the whole of that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line681"><a name="pos681"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Well Mr Chairman, if that is an intensive interrogation to your mind, then that is how it is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line682"><a name="pos682"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And the decision had already been made at Onverwacht to eliminate her?  You have heard that evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line683"><a name="pos683"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I have heard the evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line684"><a name="pos684"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> So what were you trying to, what were you trying to get out of her?  Information I would imagine?</p>
<p class="line" id="line685"><a name="pos685"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Well, I would imagine information Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line686"><a name="pos686"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And she wasn't giving the information, is that correct, because it took so long.  You said the interrogation lasted until the virtually the evening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line687"><a name="pos687"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I never had any interrogation to do with her Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line688"><a name="pos688"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Wasn't the case that she was a very hard nut to crack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line689"><a name="pos689"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is so Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line690"><a name="pos690"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And she remained defiant to the bitter end?</p>
<p class="line" id="line691"><a name="pos691"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line692"><a name="pos692"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And she refused to cooperate with the Security Branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line693"><a name="pos693"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> In my presence, that is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line694"><a name="pos694"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And I should imagine there was no difference, her being a female and being treated in a certain way, as Nxiweni was treated being a male person, he was punched and slapped on his body?</p>
<p class="line" id="line695"><a name="pos695"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> She wasn't punched or slapped on her body.</p>
<p class="line" id="line696"><a name="pos696"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Why not, what was the difference?</p>
<p class="line" id="line697"><a name="pos697"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> She just wasn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line698"><a name="pos698"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Because she was a female, are you saying that there was some sense of chivalry shown to her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line699"><a name="pos699"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> You are saying that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line700"><a name="pos700"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> No, I am trying to find out Mr Wasserman, because we can't, you are not prepared to volunteer anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line701"><a name="pos701"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, she was not assaulted at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line702"><a name="pos702"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> She must have known at some stage, she was going to be  executed, would you agree?</p>
<p class="line" id="line703"><a name="pos703"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I am unable to say so Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line704"><a name="pos704"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Well, when you led her out of the house, was she blindfolded?</p>
<p class="line" id="line705"><a name="pos705"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> She was blindfolded and believed she was going to be collected and moved to another safe house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line706"><a name="pos706"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Is that what you told her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line707"><a name="pos707"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line708"><a name="pos708"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And what did she say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line709"><a name="pos709"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> She accepted that, she had no choice.</p>
<p class="line" id="line710"><a name="pos710"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And then you clubbed her on the head from behind?</p>
<p class="line" id="line711"><a name="pos711"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line712"><a name="pos712"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Did you strike her on the, can you maybe just tell us, because the post mortem showed a fracture and I just want to clarify that.  Did you hit her on the back of the head, on the jaw or can't you remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line713"><a name="pos713"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, no, it was on the right hand side of her head.</p>
<p class="line" id="line714"><a name="pos714"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Could my learned friend point the fracture out to us Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line715"><a name="pos715"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> If my learned friend looks at page 452 on the right hand side, the diagram of the skull, there is reference to fracture lines, arrows.  But in any event, I am not going to proceed with that, you indicated that the blow was of sufficient force to render her unconscious?</p>
<p class="line" id="line716"><a name="pos716"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line717"><a name="pos717"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And it was just the one blow that you administered?</p>
<p class="line" id="line718"><a name="pos718"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> A single blow sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line719"><a name="pos719"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And was she standing up when you administered that blow?</p>
<p class="line" id="line720"><a name="pos720"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, correct sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line721"><a name="pos721"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And obviously she didn't know that you were going to strike her at the time that you administered that blow?</p>
<p class="line" id="line722"><a name="pos722"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line723"><a name="pos723"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> You then placed her in the grave, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line724"><a name="pos724"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line725"><a name="pos725"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And well, did you lay her down?  In what position did you place her before you shot her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line726"><a name="pos726"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, she was virtually lying down in the grave, but in a slightly seated up position.</p>
<p class="line" id="line727"><a name="pos727"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> I am coming to that, and you know why, you have seen the diagram of the bullet wound.</p>
<p class="line" id="line728"><a name="pos728"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line729"><a name="pos729"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> She was shot from the top of her head with the exit coming out at the roof of her mouth?  That has been shown to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line730"><a name="pos730"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line731"><a name="pos731"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Would you agree with that being the position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line732"><a name="pos732"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line733"><a name="pos733"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And after you shot her, you then stripped the body, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line734"><a name="pos734"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line735"><a name="pos735"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line736"><a name="pos736"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR PRIOR</p>
<p class="line" id="line737"><a name="pos737"></a><span class="speaker">MR NOLTE:</span> No questions Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line738"><a name="pos738"></a>NO CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR NOLTE</p>
<p class="line" id="line739"><a name="pos739"></a><span class="speaker">RE-EXAMINATION BY MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, two matters which I have neglected to put very briefly with your, it is not really re-examination, but if you will allow me just to put them very briefly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line740"><a name="pos740"></a>	The firearms you used in these incidents, in each occasion, were firearms of which the possession was not lawful in the hands of whoever the policemen was that used them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line741"><a name="pos741"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is so sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line742"><a name="pos742"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And when you entered the Allan Taylor residence on the campus of the University of Natal, was that a legal entry or an illegal entry?</p>
<p class="line" id="line743"><a name="pos743"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It was illegally done, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line744"><a name="pos744"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Illegally.</p>
<p class="line" id="line745"><a name="pos745"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR VISSER</p>
<p class="line" id="line746"><a name="pos746"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why, what was illegal about it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line747"><a name="pos747"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, the entry to the premises was illegally gained.</p>
<p class="line" id="line748"><a name="pos748"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You were going to get some explosives that you thought might be used for acts of terrorism?</p>
<p class="line" id="line749"><a name="pos749"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman, but we didn't want anybody else to see us gathering or collecting, making a collection of these weapons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line750"><a name="pos750"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What was illegal about it though, I can understand that you didn't have time to get a search warrant, so you proceeded to go and search, how was it illegal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line751"><a name="pos751"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I am not too sure about that point Mr Chairman, we made entry into I suppose the storeroom without permission of anybody.</p>
<p class="line" id="line752"><a name="pos752"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Do you need the permission of the owner when you want to seize illegal weapons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line753"><a name="pos753"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line754"><a name="pos754"></a><span class="speaker">FURTHER CROSS-EXAMINATION BY ADV PRIOR:</span> Mr Chairman, I apologise, may I just raise the matter of Pindele Mfeti, I didn't, I forgot to ask that question, but possibly through the Committee may I just ask around that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line755"><a name="pos755"></a>	It is of importance to the victims, he was a relative of Nxiweni's family, thank you.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line756"><a name="pos756"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How long will you be do you think Mr Prior?</p>
<p class="line" id="line757"><a name="pos757"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> It is virtually one question, possibly two Mr Chairman.  Mr Wasserman if you may be able to assist, and I pitch this question at the level of helping the victims, come to terms with what happened to their loved ones.</p>
<p class="line" id="line758"><a name="pos758"></a>	You have obviously followed the questioning of Mr Botha closely, and we know that one Pindele Mfeti who was also a student, he was a fairly elderly student, he was bout 40, he had a child in matric at the time, he was studying I believe law, and he was the cousin of Pumeso Nxiweni.  He disappeared on the 25th of April 1987.</p>
<p class="line" id="line759"><a name="pos759"></a>	The family are concerned that possibly in their endeavours to find Nxiweni, shortly after the acquittal in the Ramlakan case, that possibly Mfeti was mistaken for Nxiweni, and he was abducted and dealt with.  Are you able in any way, to give up any information that may assist the families?</p>
<p class="line" id="line760"><a name="pos760"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, I don't even know that name.  I have never even heard that name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line761"><a name="pos761"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line762"><a name="pos762"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY ADV PRIOR</p>
<p class="line" id="line763"><a name="pos763"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you, yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line764"><a name="pos764"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR VISSER</p>
<p class="line" id="line765"><a name="pos765"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> You say that after you shot Portia Ndwandwe as well as Pumeso Nxiweni, you covered the body with lime.  Where did you get this lime?</p>
<p class="line" id="line766"><a name="pos766"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It would have been bought at one or so, hardware store.  I can't recall where it was bought Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line767"><a name="pos767"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> When was it bought?</p>
<p class="line" id="line768"><a name="pos768"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, no, I don't know why was it bought.</p>
<p class="line" id="line769"><a name="pos769"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Why was it bought?</p>
<p class="line" id="line770"><a name="pos770"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It would have been purchased to cover the body, to stop an odour coming through the soil.</p>
<p class="line" id="line771"><a name="pos771"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> But from your evidence it seems that the lime was already there when you shot and killed these people?  Did you have lime stocked in that safe house for these kinds of actions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line772"><a name="pos772"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No Mr Chairman, I was given the lime Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line773"><a name="pos773"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why by?</p>
<p class="line" id="line774"><a name="pos774"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I was given the lime Mr Chairman, by Mr Taylor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line775"><a name="pos775"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> When did he get this lime?</p>
<p class="line" id="line776"><a name="pos776"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I don't know when he got the lime Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line777"><a name="pos777"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> So in other words, you don't know where this lime came from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line778"><a name="pos778"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I don't know when he got it or where he got it from Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line779"><a name="pos779"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Another thing which I want to clarify in my mind, is how many people in the Durban Security Branch belonged to the, I will call it the inner circle, the few people who were responsible for these killings as far as you know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line780"><a name="pos780"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, as far as I know, it would only be the applicants that are before the Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line781"><a name="pos781"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Why were you particularly chosen for this type of work, what is it that you had done, were you given any training for killing or what by the Security Branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line782"><a name="pos782"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, no, I am as military trained as anybody else and I was just in the Umkhonto weSizwe section.</p>
<p class="line" id="line783"><a name="pos783"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> The reason I am asking you is because you say that you were not in the country when Mr Nxiweni was arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line784"><a name="pos784"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> On that occasion I was debriefing informers in Swaziland Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line785"><a name="pos785"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> But why would you be the one to be chosen to kill him, to be given the orders that you must kill him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line786"><a name="pos786"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I have no idea on how to even answer that Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line787"><a name="pos787"></a><span class="speaker">ADV SIGODI:</span> Thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line788"><a name="pos788"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Before my colleague asks questions, did Mr Taylor give you this lime when he told you to eliminate, did he say well, take them outside, eliminate them and sprinkle lime on them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line789"><a name="pos789"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> He knew of the lime, these occasions here, he actually handed me the packet of lime.</p>
<p class="line" id="line790"><a name="pos790"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did he tell you what to do with it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line791"><a name="pos791"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes Mr Chairman, he told me to spread it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line792"><a name="pos792"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> On top of the bodies, after you undressed them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line793"><a name="pos793"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line794"><a name="pos794"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I wanted to ask this same question, but just from a different angle, clearly the lime wasn't purchased specifically for these events, because the lime was there, it was evening, decisions were made at night.  You have no knowledge of anyone going out to buy it specifically for the burying of specific victims that your applications relate to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line795"><a name="pos795"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No Mr Chairman, I am not aware of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line796"><a name="pos796"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And the lime was not only available in Pietermaritzburg near Elandskop, it was also available on other farms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line797"><a name="pos797"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It was used on the other farm as well Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line798"><a name="pos798"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You were involved on more than one occasion, with spreading lime?</p>
<p class="line" id="line799"><a name="pos799"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes Mr Chairman, they are in the application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line800"><a name="pos800"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Yes.  And did you form any opinion as to the availability of the lime?</p>
<p class="line" id="line801"><a name="pos801"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Personally no, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line802"><a name="pos802"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You can't tell us whether you think even at this stage, whether lime was kept for such occasions or whether it was specifically bought?</p>
<p class="line" id="line803"><a name="pos803"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No Mr Chairman, I never ever saw lime laying around, I was just handed it on the occasion.  I never saw packets of lime.</p>
<p class="line" id="line804"><a name="pos804"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And you have no idea where Taylor got the lime from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line805"><a name="pos805"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line806"><a name="pos806"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How big were the packets that you were given?  You weren't given a bag of lime, you were given a small packet, not a 50 kg pocket?</p>
<p class="line" id="line807"><a name="pos807"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No Mr Chairman, a small packet which you would tear the top off and sprinkle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line808"><a name="pos808"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Pre-packed pack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line809"><a name="pos809"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, a small packet sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line810"><a name="pos810"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Yes, but was it pre-packed by the distributor, the manufacturer or whoever would have distributed it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line811"><a name="pos811"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes Mr Chairman.  It was in, it looked like the commercial packaging.</p>
<p class="line" id="line812"><a name="pos812"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Commercial packaging?</p>
<p class="line" id="line813"><a name="pos813"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line814"><a name="pos814"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> The other issue that I just want to further pursue is, you gave evidence last week about the elimination of Bhila and your simply being present at the time, that at some later stage you became aware that he was to be eliminated?  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line815"><a name="pos815"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Taylor told me at a later stage, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line816"><a name="pos816"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> In this, it really relates to the same question, a group of people involved, I find it extremely difficult to look at the applicants as you have referred to them, as the only people within the so-called inner circle for want of a better word, that you never discussed these incidents with each other, that you wouldn't ask questions, even as to where was the person killed, how was he killed, was he buried or not, where was he buried.  You heard the evidence, and this is the line of evidence, that you never spoke of it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line817"><a name="pos817"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, that is correct.  In this kind of job, nobody ever would speak out, it would stay where it was, that is where it was.  There was a code of ethics that one wouldn't ask and one wouldn't say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line818"><a name="pos818"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Not even amongst co-perpetrators, people planning together, deciding together to kill a person?  You wouldn't ask questions of each other?</p>
<p class="line" id="line819"><a name="pos819"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No Mr Chairman, if that portion was yours to do, then that was done, and it was left at that Mr Chairman.  It was left at that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line820"><a name="pos820"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Was there ever such an instruction not to ask questions, not to talk?  Did that code of ethic if one could call it such, simply develop out of the blue, did it just dawn upon you or was it agreed, did Taylor or someone tell you listen, no one asks questions, no one speaks?</p>
<p class="line" id="line821"><a name="pos821"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, I am unable if there was a person specifically there, but it was very evident amongst us all that such a code was there, but nobody specifically ever told me that is how it is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line822"><a name="pos822"></a>	It just comes in the Special Branch type of activity.</p>
<p class="line" id="line823"><a name="pos823"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So, as far as Port Natal is concerned, your involvement with Bhila, was that an induction in a sense, an initiation with the group or not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line824"><a name="pos824"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, not so Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line825"><a name="pos825"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> When did you become aware of this code of ethics of not speaking and not asking and not reporting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line826"><a name="pos826"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I already knew of that in my previous service Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line827"><a name="pos827"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Which was where?</p>
<p class="line" id="line828"><a name="pos828"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> In the Rhodesian setup Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line829"><a name="pos829"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So you had similar experiences there, is that what you are telling us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line830"><a name="pos830"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, not at all Mr Chairman, but in war and in operations, one learns that this ethic is there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line831"><a name="pos831"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Not even to discuss with people who went out on the same mission with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line832"><a name="pos832"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, the details weren't discussed, the result would have been.</p>
<p class="line" id="line833"><a name="pos833"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line834"><a name="pos834"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> May I add something Mr Chairman.  May I add on the question of the lime.</p>
<p class="line" id="line835"><a name="pos835"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, I think we were going to talk about the same thing, page 444?</p>
<p class="line" id="line836"><a name="pos836"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line837"><a name="pos837"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You haven't been told yet, when the body was exhumed, a yellow plastic bag, dolomite agricultural lime, 10 kg was around both feet.  Would that be about the size of the bags that you were given?</p>
<p class="line" id="line838"><a name="pos838"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is the size Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line839"><a name="pos839"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  We will adjourn now until 9 o'clock tomorrow morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line840"><a name="pos840"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Can this witness be excused Mr Chairman?  As it pleases you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line841"><a name="pos841"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line842"><a name="pos842"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
