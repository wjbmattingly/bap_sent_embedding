<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The procedure was so far that Mr Mac Maharaj was interposed and he was a witness on behalf of the victims.  We have three witnesses left of the applicants, Mr Chairman.  These witnesses are all operators, to call them that, for want of a better expression, who followed orders of Mr Botha.  What we did, however, Mr Chairman, because you did not hear the evidence of Mr Botha who gave evidence about all the facts, we are going to lead Mr Wasserman slightly out of turn, Mr Chairman in order to give you some background and we will lead his evidence, not fully, but just to give you some background of the incident and we therefore call Mr Wasserman.  He is available and ready to take the oath.  He has no objection to taking the oath.  He will give his evidence in English, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">LAWRENCE GERALD WASSERMAN:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR VISSER:</span> Mr Wasserman, you have given evidence before the Amnesty Committee hearing the incidents presently in this cycle here at Durban, although there was a different Chairman.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Do you repeat and incorporate your previous evidence and the references you made to other evidence also in your evidence today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Your amnesty application appears in the Ndaba bundle at pages 40 to 54 where you deal with this specific incident at page 50, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You have also drafted, or a document was drafted on instructions from you, setting out a synopsis of your evidence, which you now have before you and which, Mr Chairman, we beg leave to hand in as Exhibit K, do you also confirm the correctness of the contents thereof, subject to your evidence which you are about to give now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Will you tell the Committee if you will, what you recall about this incident, in paragraph 1 at page 2?</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, Sir.  Mr Chairman I'm reminded that the incident in question took place in the period 7 to 15 July 1990.  I first became involved in this incident when I was summonsed by Maj du Preez to the C R Swart Square offices of the Security Branch in Durban.  At the offices I found a person being held who had apparently been arrested by an askari.  At some stage Col Botha requested to speak to us in another office.  Present there were Col Taylor, Col Botha, Maj du Preez and myself.  It may have been that van der Westhuizen might also have been present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a>	Col Botha informed us that the person held, i.e. Charles Ndaba, MK Zwelakhe, was his informant.  I remember being surprised by this news in view of the high profile of Mr Ndaba.  It was made clear during the discussion that Ndaba's arrest was a big mistake and that he would have to be released.  Botha asked Taylor to ensure that the askari did not spread the story that he had arrested Ndaba for the fear that it might become known that Ndaba was arrested by the Security Branch and immediately released, thereby raising the question whether he might be an informer of the Security Branch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a>	It was decided to transfer Ndaba to a safe-house in Verulam which we made use of at the time.  This was in order to allow for some time to pass in order to monitor the situation. and allow Botha an opportunity of briefing or debriefing Ndaba.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> At C R Swart Square, was Mr Ndaba assaulted in any way in your presence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Not in my presence Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Could I ask you just perhaps to go slightly slower so that the interpreter can keep up with the interpretation, Mr Wasserman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Please continue.  Paragraph 7.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> At some stage during the day we were informed that Ndaba had a prior appointment to meet with Mr Mbuso Shabalala and it was decided that he should keep the appointment.  We went to the appointed spot with him in order to monitor the meeting in case Mr Ndaba's arrest that day, might have placed him in danger because we were not certain whether the ANC might have received information about it.  At the time we suspected that there was an ANC mole who had been infiltrated into the Security Branch at C R Swart Square.  This suspicion was later confirmed although not proved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well, we know from the evidence of Mr Maharaj that this was in fact so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Please continue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> At the appointed place, Col Botha, Sgt van der Westhuizen and Ndaba got out of the car and walked to the pre-arranged meeting place.  They then disappeared from sight.  We were then called on the radio by Botha who gave us the position and description of a car into which Ndaba had got into.  Du Preez and I drove to a point where we could observe the car and stopped.  We knew that a secret signal had been agreed upon in advance for Ndaba to give should he feel threatened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a>	At some stage Ndaba gave the signal and we immediately left our vehicle and approached the blue Toyota Corolla.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Can I just stop you there?  Did you actually see him give the signal or was it that you were told?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I never saw the signal being given myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Were you told to move in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> By whom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> By Maj du Preez.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> By Maj du Preez.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> We "arrested" Ndaba and Mbuso Shabalala, who's MK name was Jack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Now can I just ask you for some clarification there?  You see Mr Botha gave evidence to say that his recollection was that only Mr Shabalala was "arrested", but not Mr Ndaba.  What was your impression?  What was the situation there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, at the "arrest" of Shabalala, Ndaba was also "arrested", it would appear as though he was arrested and he was taken away by Mr van der Westhuizen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  Why did, in your mind, why was it important to make it appear that Mr Ndaba was also being arrested, together with Shabalala?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> This would indicate that Mr Ndaba was not getting preferential treatment and he was also arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, not to raise suspicions with Mr Shabalala.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is the correct position.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What precisely was your part in this "arrest"?  Who did you deal with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, du Preez and I entered the back of the vehicle and pulled Mr Shabalala into the back, where he was detained by us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Was he sitting upright, or what was the position, when you pulled him to the back?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, he was sitting upright Mr Chairman, then we pulled him over the seat, to us in the back of the vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  And after that had happened, was he then in an upright position of what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> He was placed down on the seat with this head down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  Could he see outside what was happening with Ndaba from the position in which he was in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> He would be unable to see.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright.  What happened then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, du Preez and I transported Shabalala in his vehicle to the safe-house on the instructions of Mr Botha.  While Botha and Ndaba followed in Botha's vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Shabalala's vehicle, what was that?  What was the make and the colour of the vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, it was a blue Toyota Corolla.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Right.  What happened at the safe-house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> At the safe-house we locked Shabalala into one of the bedrooms.  In view of the fact that Ndaba was already a Security Branch informer and given his status in MK, he was previously acting Commander of MK Natal Machinery in Swaziland, I was given to understand that we might not be interested in any information which Shabalala might be able to give us, nor were we told we had to attempt to recruit him as an informer.  He was simply detained and as far as I know not seriously questioned.  Neither Ndaba nor Shabalala were assaulted or ill-treated in any way throughout the period in which they were kept at the safe-house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you have conversations with Mr Shabalala?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Periodic conversations, yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> But not any attempt at interrogation or recruitment, as you said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> None at all, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright.  Go on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I was aware of a dilemma which was coming about as this arrest of Shabalala.  We did not know whether Shabalala might not become suspicious that Ndaba had led us to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Mr Visser, can I just come in here?  Mr Wasserman I would like you just to clarify paragraph 10, where you state that,</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a>"he was simply detained and as far as I know not seriously questioned."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a>Are you aware of the members of C20 who questioned him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I'm aware of the presence of C20 at that place but I didn't participate with them in any questioning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Do you know whether they questioned him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> They did talk with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you to Commissioner Bosman.  Would you please continue then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> The problem became compounded when it appeared that Shabalala in fact suspected Ndaba of working with the police.  I remember him saying as much an I might add that Shabalala was robust and aggressive throughout.  During the period 7 to 14 July, du Preez, van der Westhuizen and myself guarded Shabalala and Ndaba in turn.  At some point during the weekend, Col Botha briefed us that he had obtained information from Ndaba which pointed to a massive operation run by the ANC SACP to incite a people's revolt.  It was clear that the information was of fundamental importance and that it would probably materially affect the negotiation process which was under way at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a>	On the 12th of July 1990, as far as I can remember, Maj du Preez and myself were conducting an observation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Now, perhaps you could just fill us in a little bit.  Tell us about this observation.  Where was it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, we were observing a place called the Knoll.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> K-N-O-L-L?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> And we were observing the movements of persons entering the premises and leaving them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright.  And just continue then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman at the time of conducting an observation, at the time Mr Siphiwe Nyanda became aware of our observation and this necessitated his arrest for fear that he might warn others of the police, that the police were onto them and for fear that he might go into hiding.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What, how did you arrive at the conclusion that your cover was blown, so to speak?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, we followed Mr Nyanda from the Knoll quite a long distance into town.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Was he walking and you walking, or what was the position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, Mr Chairman, he was in a Toyota Cressida.  He was alone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And you followed him with what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Du Preez and I were in a Nissan, Nissan Sedan.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  And what happened then as far as the arrest was concerned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, we anticipated that Mr Nyanda had cottoned on to our surveillance and we then moved in, blocked his vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you call other, did you call for assistance on the radio?</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, there was a second vehicle accompanying us on the surveillance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright.  You blocked him in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> We blocked him in on the road and du Preez and I alighted from our vehicle and he was formerly arrested and placed into our motor vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What happened to his motor vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> One of the members in the second vehicle of ours then commenced to drive that vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And where did you go?</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> We proceeded directly to C R Swart Square.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Now, just continue with what is stated in your statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Carrying on from the statement it states.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> He was arrested with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, Sir, he was arrested with certain weapons in his possession, photographs of which appear in The Other Side of the Story at the last page.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Now, perhaps that does not set out the position accurately as it could have.  When you say he was in possession of these weapons would you just explain to the Chairman how it came about that they were found and when they were found and where they were found.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman.  And upon arrest, we transported Mr Nyanda in our vehicle to C R Swart and another member drove Mr Nyanda's car to C R Swart Square and the vehicle was cursory searched and gone through by myself, but no weapons were found in the vehicle during the cursory search.  It was at a later stage that a thorough search was done on the vehicle and then the weapon was recovered and that is the one that appears on the last page of The Other Side of the Story.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What kind of weapon is that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I'm not sure of the weapon.  No, I see it, I have heard, it's got a silencer on it and it's a 45 calibre, but the actual make, I don't recall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Is it not a common weapon that you were used to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That you're accustomed to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, it's not a common one carried by liberation forces.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright.  So in fact the weapons, to put it accurately, the weapon was discovered later not at the same time as the arrest, but it was discovered in Mr Nyanda's car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Were you present at all when the weapons were taken out of that car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I was not, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And you wouldn't know what exactly was found there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I would not, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright.  Now there was evidence by Mr Botha and Mr Steyn that Head Office had given instructions, I believe it was on the 11th that there should preferably be no arrests before the 16th of July which was later on so that there could be time to notify various institutions, intelligence organisations, embassies etc.  At the time when Mr Nyanda was arrested, had that instruction been conveyed to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Now, let us assume for a moment that you had an instruction, that you had received an instruction, that you should not go ahead with arrests.  Given the circumstances as you experience them and as you've told the Committee now, what would you have done in regard to the arrest of Mr Nyanda?</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, we would have gone ahead with the arrest of Mr Nyanda.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Due to the fact that he had detected, his counter surveillance had proved positive, he had detected us and he would have warned other parties and they would have gone into hiding.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> They would have gone into hiding.  Yes.  Alright.  Please continue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, at some stage Ndaba became anxious and indicated that he intended to divulge his role as an informer to the SAP, to the ANC.  I was aware that Botha was making attempts to convince him to desist from the idea.  Although I cannot remember the details or the date thereof, we were informed from time to time about the progress or rather the lack of progress which Botha had with these attempts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a>	The next important moment which I recall was when Botha informed us that Ndaba persisted with his intention of taking his chances with the ANC and as such could not be allowed to go free under any circumstances because of the knowledge that Ndaba possessed about other informants and couriers of the Security Branch.  Botha informed us that there was no other option than to eliminate Ndaba.  The decision that Ndaba was to be eliminated, changed the situation for Shabalala.  Where previously he could not have been released for fear of him compromising Ndaba, that consideration fell away.  Col Botha nevertheless decided that Shabalala should also be eliminated by reason of the fact that he would tell the ANC that he would be abducted by the police and that he was unlawfully detained and that he would also in all probability have told the ANC that Ndaba had been detained with him and of his suspicion that the police had killed him.  During the period of time when negotiations were under way, these revelations would have caused a sensation that would have embarrassed the National Party and the Government.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a>	We were thus instructed by Col Botha to assist with the elimination of both Ndaba and Shabalala.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> As we know, this took place during the day of the 14th of July 1990.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Please continue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I recall that on a particular night, we took Ndaba and Shabalala out of the house and drove off with them in a VW kombi on the North Coast road on the pretext that they were being moved to another safe-house.  Van der Westhuizen, who had picked a spot earlier during the day, drove us to the river mouth of the Tugela River.  We stopped near the bushes at the river mouth and van der Westhuizen and I got out under the pretext that we wanted to relieve ourselves.  In fact, we went to the river mouth to make sure that the coast was clear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a>	When we returned Botha said that everyone had to go for a leak and seeing that we had a long road ahead of us.  We got out of the kombi and I remember that I was close to Ndaba and Shabalala because after they had relieved themselves, I touched them both on the shoulders with a downward motion, and instructed them to sit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Where were you now?  Were you still at the kombi, or where were you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, Mr Chairman, we had walked 20 to 30 metres away from the kombi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Were you on the banks of the river mouth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> We were on the banks of the Tugela River mouth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Virtually immediately two shots were fired, one by Botha who shot Mr Ndaba and the other by du Preez who shot Mr Shabalala, both in the head.  Both died instantaneously.  Each was given another shot to make certain that they were dead.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a>	I went back to the kombi where van der Westhuizen was keeping observation and to the best of my recollection, he helped me carry the hessian cloth, concrete pole and wire to the scene whereafter he again went back to the kombi to keep observation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Now these articles, were they brought along with you from wherever you were before you went to the River Mouth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman, they came from the safe-house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> From the safe-house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> In Verulam.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, we tied the pole and wrapped the hessian around the bodies of the two men with binding wire and they were placed in the water alongside the bank of the River Mouth.  Before the bodies were placed into the river, their clothes were removed and placed in a black plastic bag which we took along with us back to the safe-house in Verulam.  We remained a while to make sure that we cleaned up the area of all possible signs of what had happened and to make sure that the bodies did not come afloat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a>	We then returned to Verulam where we burned the clothes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  I think Botha said you also burned some branches with which the blood was swept away.  Do you have any recollection of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman, there was some branches, but some branches were thrown into the river.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright.  Please continue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Later that same evening on the orders of Col Botha, du Preez and I took out the Toyota Corolla out of the garage and drove some distance to a dumping sight near the tarred road but in a rural area.  There we searched the car and doused it with petrol and set it alight.  We remained in the vicinity of the burning car just long enough to be certain that it would be burned out completely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Later Mr Wasserman, did you attempt to find this site again and to point it out to the Investigation Unit Inspectors of the TRC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Were you able to find this site?</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> We weren't able to find the site, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright.  Please continue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, my attention has been drawn to allegations mad by one Thuzi and Zungu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Can you just stop there for a moment, please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, we are referring to Exhibit G, page 15 where you will find a statement by one Zebron Thuzi.  My attorney tells me its F.  I'm sorry it must F, yes, I'm sorry Mr Chairman and also in F you will find at page 19 the statement of one Phillip Zungu (Z-U-N-G-U).  These are the documents which are now being referred to Mr Chairperson.  Perhaps, more specifically, I might draw your attention to, if we first look at Mr Thuzi's statement, there's a build-up at page 16 in paragraph 7 and 8 where he was told according to him by Taylor to go and sleep in a certain place and where the next morning he went to the workshop and he found Taylor, du Preez and Lawrie, which is an obvious reference to Mr Wasserman and the next paragraph Mr Chairman, is paragraph 9, where he talks of a chopped up vehicle which he describes as a light blue Toyota Corolla and then he goes on in paragraph 10 to say, the Monday in the afternoon, du Preez arrived with a white bakkie and although he says he helped him off load the chopped up spares, he's sure to have intended to say that he helped him load the spares which was chopped up, Mr Chairman and then in paragraph 11 there's a reference to the engine which stayed there for 2 or 3 weeks and he says that he took for himself the seat part of the rear seat and he says that he's still got part of it left Mr Chairman and also I think he mentions a carpet, which he also took.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a>	That is a summary of his evidence and then page 20, Mr Chairman, and paragraph 6 there's a reference to spare parts of a motor vehicle, an engine and a gearbox and he makes the statement at the bottom of page 20 of Exhibit F:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a>"The vehicle had previously been a light blue Toyota Corolla."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a>Thuzi he says, made a report about the vehicle and then he saw that some of the parts were removed by du Preez and Wasserman in a White Isuzu bakkie, he says in paragraph 7 and that the engine remained behind for some time and later he himself helped to load the engine onto the same bakkie.  Now that his what we are referring to now is it not, Mr Wasserman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Now will you just tell the Committee, this place which is referred to as a place in Camperdown by these two witnesses, what transpired there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, this was Col Taylor's headquarters.   It was Col Taylor's askari farm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> It was a farm was it not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman it was a farm with two houses on it and a workshop.</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And who were accommodated there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> The askaris were accommodated there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And you say there was a workshop on the farm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And did you ever visit that workshop?</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I did, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And did du Preez also visit that workshop?</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> He did, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And what did you go and do there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, there we worked on many motor vehicles.  We resprayed them, we fixed them up.  We would fix them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What was that in aid of?</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> In the course of our duties and infiltration methods we would change the appearance of vehicles and the colours of vehicle on numerous occasions, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  And were some of these vehicles also used by the askaris?</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> They were Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Will you then just continue at paragraph 31?</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, I have no recollection of a blue Toyota being chopped up at the farm, but I cannot place it in dispute.  What I can say, however, is that if that happened, it was not Mr Shabalala's vehicle because I am absolutely certain that that vehicle was destroyed by fire.</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> What do you say about the allegation that you were present when certain parts of a chopped up vehicle was loaded onto a white Isuzu bakkie?  Can you recall that to mind?</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, Mr Chairman, that's incorrect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You say it didn't happen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That didn't happen, Mr Chairman,</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you have anything to do with the loading of an engine at any point in time?  Is that possible?</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, yes I would, well, vehicle parts, tyres, jacks, that kind of thing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Engines?</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Parts of engines, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Not whole engines?</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Never a whole engine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright.  Can you explain to the Committee why you were motivated to participate in these events?</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, my actions to participate in the events to this incident and to associate myself therewith, were prompted by my complete belief that what I did, I did while executing my duties as a policeman, the way that I saw it, as my obligation during the time of conflict and political violence at the time.  We were not engaged in a conventional war where the sides could be identified and attacks were limited against visible enemies.  It was an unconventional war situation as was explained by Gen Steyn in his evidence.  During this conflict, we as Security policemen were conditioned by speeches of politicians and directions by our senior officers, to do everything that was in our power to confront the revolutionary onslaught at all costs.  There were times when in terms of the prevailing legislation of the time, it was not possible to solve all the problems that came one's way.  The present case is perhaps an example of such an instance.  in view of the above, I was of the bona fide belief that what I did in the present instance in order to combat or derail the revolutionary onslaught and to protect the government and National Party from political embarrassment, fell within my express or implied authority.  I did not participate in the events for any personal gain, or driven by personal spite or malice and I received no reward.</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Wasserman, can I just briefly refer you to Exhibit J which was handed in by the previous witness, Mr Maharaj?  Mr Chairman, if it would meet with your satisfaction, I do not intend to go through each of those items with Mr Wasserman, I'm simply going to ask him whether he agrees with what I put to the witness, yea or nay, but if you feel that I should, then I'll go through the exercise, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, has he gone through them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Wasserman, were  you here during the cross-examination of Mr Maharaj?</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I was, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Were you present when I put to him certain explanations of what certain letters of the alphabet that precede numbers and other letters in Exhibit J mean?</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That's correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you agree with the evidence which I put to him about the meaning of those letters?</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman, as best as I heard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, I can go through them all again if you require that.  Not much turns on it, Mr Chairman, with respect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, there's one I would like to ask him about.  We haven't been told about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, certainly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is PNV for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, PN is the division of Port Natal, V for Veiligheidstak, Security Branch, V.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry?</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> V is for Veiligheid.  So that identifies, that prefix shows that its Port Natal Security Branch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And the 4?</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> The 4 means Black, the subject that you are about to, that reference is going to be the reference number of a black man.</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And PNV 1 would have been a reference to what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> A Port Natal subject, Security subject, white.</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And 2?</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Would be the same, but a coloured subject.</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And three?</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Port Natal, Security Branch, coloured subject, Indian, 3 would be Indian.</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did that always remain the position, or did that change at some point?</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, Mr Chairman that was countrywide but the prefix in front would change for the relevant division.</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, but the 1, 2, 3 and 4, the racial classification if I may call it that, did that remain the same or did that change?</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It was a national referencing system, it stayed the same.</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Just while we're on the subject,  so the V therefore refers to a Security subject, Veiligheids onderwerp?  Would that be correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> In other words somebody who was</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Enjoying the attention of the branch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Under  the attention of the branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Yes.  And if one looks at page 11 of that annexure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, Mr Chair?</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> If you look next to the name Ndaba, in the second line of that entry after the photograph reference, under "Afdelings verwysing" PNV4 what's the stroke V for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, that indicates that that V before the number, that that was an interim file, so PNV4, Port Natal Security Branch, 4 - black, the V is an interim file and as that file grows the V would drop away and get the next figures after that 4 stroke, would then be what the new file would be.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So this implied that that person was newly brought to your attention?</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Not necessarily, Mr Chairman, sometimes the V would remain for a considerable period of time, it was merely an administration thing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR KNIGHT:</span> And  why, I'm just interested, the next entry in respect of Zandile, has the same reference.  Both at a regional level and at an H Q level.  The only difference is that at an HQ level, there's no PN in brackets behind it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I can point that out, Mr Chairman.  What happened round about this period of time, a new computer system, reference system was being installed at S H Q and they were doing away with the 1, 2, 3, 4 reference numbers and everybody was just getting a V, for Veiligheid and then the next number would just be how the computer would get it and the PN would show the division or the region from which the suspect emanated from, so if that was OTV then you'd know that Ndwandwe came from Oos Transvaal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Perhaps just to add to the question which Commissioner Lax has just put to you, to make it absolutely clear, wee files kept by the Security Branch only on suspects or on a variety of people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> On a variety of persons, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Because at page 11 of Exhibit J1 one has Buthelezi, Gatsha, for example, who also has a file. Both at divisional level as well as at Security Head Office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.  Now you applied ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Just one last aspect, before we move away from there.  If you could just clear up an aspect that occurred to me at any rate.  On page 12 there's a "Verspreiding" heading and items 1 to 5 indicate obviously departments, items 6 to, I can't read the others but 12 at any rate look like file references, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, the first five, L1 and L2, were desks at Headquarters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Desks.  Security desk at Headquarters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So what would L stand for and A?</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You've got L1 and A1.</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman, I think section A was ANC general affairs and L, I forget what it was, I think it might have been an analytical section.</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Alright.</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I don't - there were many of those.</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> But the others are clearly some of the same reference numbers as appear in the previous list.</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman, then the O Transvaal, Northern Natal, that would have been the other regions that this report was distributed to, then after that, NV9/126 Swaziland, that Port Natal, Security Branch 916 was the number for the ANC, that was our reference number for ANC, then the numbers underneath that, PN 666, that would be a copy to the source file of the agent, PNV 22/29/16 was the Inkatha file, so there would have been a copy made for that, for some reason, it will be in the contents of the report, I can't comment now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Would that have been an Inkatha file kept by the Security Police, or kept by Inkatha?</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No that's the Security Branch's code reference for Inkatha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Alright, continue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> PNV 13/436, that was, now I can't recall but I heard today maybe the UDF file, so a copy would have been placed in that.  PNV4/35 as we've seen now, was Mangosotho Buthelezi's personal file, so copy 10 would have gone into that.  Copy 11, PNV4/V/139, was the intermittent file for Mr Ndaba and then number 12SV 665 Port Natal was Zandile's file, that would have been filed in that file.</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> ...the evidence of Mr Maharaj is this went to 15 different departments and in fact it only went to about 3 other stations, the rest are all sub-files within your own filing system.</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, Sir, all at Port Natal, PNB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> I just wanted to correct that apparent inaccuracy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, Mr Chairperson we did in fact draw attention to the very fact that you mentioned, that Commissioner Lax mentioned, when we cross-examined Mr Maharaj, because that appears from page 1 to which regions the report was sent, where you will find Oos Transvaal, Natal and Noord Natal in the right-hand column, Mr Chairman, but I didn't realise that there might be a problem with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just let's go on to the next one. V6665/PN.  Would that be an informer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Page, please Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Page 12, the list you've just been looking at.</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> That's Zandile.  She's Filla Portia Ndwandwe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, Mr Chairman, at that stage PN following a V number it merely says Port Natal, subject of Port Natal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That was the file of whom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> The one we're referring to now was of Zandile.  Filla Ndwandwe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Ndwandwe, yes.  And reference, Mr Chairman, has previously been made to that very reference and you will find the first one at page 2, paragraph 2.6 of Exhibit J1.</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Can I just round this off?</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, I'm confused, the one I was looking at is on page 1, it's only two sixes, 665.</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, but that is...</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I got the numbers confused.</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, but that's preceded by PN which denotes an informer as I understand it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, but I wondered if in the filing system you put the, you might put the informer behind, because its a four letter number against the three for informers, so no its a different.</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Wasserman ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry Mr Visser, just one last aspect.  It's also clear from the front of that annexure on page 1 that a copy went to DNI and AMI.</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> It didn't go to them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, we excluded them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You excluded them.  I just wanted to be clear about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman its not going to National Intelligence, not going to military Intelligence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> It says "Beperk" Mr Chairman, it means excluded.  So they didn't get it.  Just one aspect which I didn't understand correctly and I did not put quite correctly to Mr Maharaj and to which you have drawn my attention, the synopsis given in paragraph 2 I put to Mr Maharaj, was done by yourself, is that correct, or is that incorrect?  I'm talking about Exhibit J1.</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Was that synopsis written by you or by someone else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, Mr Chairman, it wasn't written by myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Was that also done by?</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Capt at that time Botha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Capt Botha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I'm sorry about that Mr Chairman, I was under the impression that this was done by Wasserman, but I was clearly incorrect, he's drawn my attention to that.  And what follows thereafter in paragraph 3 and following is what the information was that you received from the informer, clearly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct, yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So Botha being your Commander is the person that receives this information and from then on he's got to deal with it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> On this occasion that's how it happened, Mr Chairman,  he processed the report and the Intelligence ...(indistinct).</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry could I just be clear about this?  So you didn't actually draft this report?  You compiled the information in a sense and reported it to Botha.  You prepared this document?</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct, yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Thanks Mr Visser, I just wasn't clear about that, I just wanted to make absolutely sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, but I must concede Mr Chairman, that I gave rise to the uncertainty because I misunderstood it myself.  Yes.  Would you then look at page 1 of Exhibit K?  You applied for amnesty for the abduction or man stealing or the unlawful arrest of Mr Mbuso Shabalala, the unlawful detention or deprivation of liberty of both Mr Ndaba and Mr Shabalala, the murder of both these gentlemen and well, what weapons were used at the time to assassinate Mr Ndaba and Mr Shabalala?</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, use was made of two Scorpions, sub-machine gun pistols.</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> For so far as it may be accepted or assumed that you were as it were also in possession of those weapons, you also apply for amnesty in regard to the unlawful possession of such ammunition and weapons as were with you on that particular evening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> You apply for malicious damage to property in regard to the Corolla vehicle in regard to the vehicle of Mr Shabalala.</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> And any lesser offence or delict which may be supported by the facts, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That's correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, would you allow me a moment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a>Yes, perhaps you may be able to shed light on this and perhaps not, please say what your knowledge is.  Do you know who of Mr Nyanda and Mr Gordhan was arrested first on the 12th of July?  Do you have knowledge of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr chairman, I'm of the firm opinion that we arrested Mr Nyanda first.</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Would the information about that have gone out to other people, about that arrest?</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It would have, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Did you know where van der Westhuizen was on that particular day, what his duties were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, he was doing a surveillance and observation at Brickhill Road.</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Brickhill Road?</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR VISSER</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR WILLS:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.  Mr Wasserman, I take it, from the evidence, that you were one of Col Botha's most trusted and selected operatives?</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I think so, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes, he chose to divulge the very secrecy of the fact that this person was an informer, the fact that Mr Ndaba was an informer to you and he wouldn't have divulged that even to the general of the police at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Well, I don't know what he said to the General, Sir, but he divulged it to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes and he also involved you in his scheme to hide the fact of the arrest of these two comrades from the other police members. is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman there was only one really arrested, the other party was a charade arrest.</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Mr Wasserman, I'm not wanting to play with words, I'm talking about the two people that you had arrested, detained, illegally abducted, kidnapped whichever you want to phrase it, but the two people Mr Shabalala and Mr Ndaba, my question is that the fact that you had these people was only revealed to you and you were trusted to assist in this plan to hide this fact from other policemen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Were you told to hide this fact from other policemen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It was a unit, yes, it was to remain a secret.</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes, because Gen Steyn has conceded during his cross-examination that the members of de Beer's unit, of de Beer's investigation team who were investigating on a national level the Operation Vula, were looking for these people and so you were part of the plan to tell these people that you didn't know where they were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Did you stand guard or did you stay, should I rather say, at the safe-house in Verulam, from the time of arrest of Ndaba, that is the 7th of July 1990 until their murder?</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Intermittently so, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Where did you sleep at night during that period?</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> In the same house, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes, and the only time you left the house was for the operations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Now it's glaringly apparent from your affidavit and also from your application which just refers to Botha's application and I think, I'm not sure but it was Botha's and possibly Steyn's, that you were not involved in surveillance operations prior to the arrest of Ndaba in regard to the safe houses that are mentioned, Brickhill Road and Knoll.</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Sorry Sir, when was I involved with them, the surveillance?</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> After the arrest of Ndaba.</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Was I involved with surveillance after the arrest of Ndaba?</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> No.  Sorry if I'm confusing you.  It seems to me that the only time you got involved with that surveillance operation was after the arrest of Ndaba, after the 7th of July in other words.</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, Sir, that's so, my personal involvement yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes, now who else was in your unit, this select unit?  I know that it must have involved the other applicants and they are Mr du Preez, Mr van der Westhuizen, but there must have been more persons than that because you were observing two houses, is that not so?  So who were you observing, the Knoll, the safe-house known as the Knoll with after the 7th of July?</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I was with Mr du Preez.</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And you said that you had a second car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Before you go on, you said a few minutes ago you only started after the 7th of July.  How long after the 7th?  For how long had you been observing this house when the arrest took place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, I'm not too sure, it was a couple of, me personally, it was a couple of days on and off.</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, can I just clarify something that's arisen, if you don't mind?  You only got involved on the 7th?</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes. Mr Chairman, I got involved when I was called to CR Swart.</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And it was only after the 7th that you began to observe anything?</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman, I continued with my normal duties, predominantly Swaziland operations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You say you continued with your normal duties?</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I was continuing with my normal duties.</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Up until that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Now, in terms of the observations that you went on, can you recall when those were and how many there were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, it was many evenings, it was quite a few evenings and afternoons and I would relieve and be relieved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Yes.  Now who was working with you on all those observations besides du Preez?</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It was principally du Preez and there were, I think once or twice or maybe even thrice the chaps from C20 were asked to come and accompany the Durban guy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And those are the people who are mentioned in the papers who were present at the safe-house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> McCarter, van Zyl, I think it is and others.  I can't remember all the names, but it's not that relevant right now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It's them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> I think there's four of them.  Now, on the day you picked up Nyanda, who was in the other car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It was members of that C20.  I recall only one person's name and that's Roeland.</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And the four of you were staked out there observing this place, the Knoll?</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Carry on Mr Wills, sorry to ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Thank you..  Now you say you have knowledge that another person was at the other house in Brickhill Road.  I'm sorry, I didn't get the name of that person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That was van der Westhuizen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Van der Westhuizen and who was he with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And I would assume that it's probably that there was also a second car there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I have no idea at all what the logistics would have been for that surveillance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes, I'm not asking you from your personal knowledge, I'm asking you from your experience as a security policeman and it would seem to me to be a likely scenario that you would have a back-up.  I mean you had one, so the chances are that they also would have had one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> The chances are, but I think he was surveilling a residence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> If it can assist my learned friend, I can tell him now, Mr Chairman, that van der Westhuizen's evidence will be that he was there alone, if it can assist at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can I interrupt for a moment.  What is the Knoll?</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, it was a house and the Knoll was the address where it was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Not a residence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, it is, it's a double storied residence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Oh because I thought you were distinguishing, because you were saying van der Westhuizen was observing a residence, so were you, you were both observing residences?</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> I'm sorry are you not wanting to comment on my question?  My question was that in all probability there would have been a back-up at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I would have presumed so, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes.  And in probability if a back-up was used, because this was such a secret operation, that it would have also been these trusted people from C20?  We're talking about after the 8th of, or after the 7th of July now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Sorry, are you referring to van der Westhuizen's surveillance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes.  I'm saying the chances are, I know that you've already indicated you don't have previous knowledge, or personal knowledge.  Well let me phrase it another way.  Do you know of any other person other than yourselves, the applicants in this matter in other words, the five applicants, that's Gen Steyn, Col Botha, Mr du Preez, Mr Steyn and yourself and those people at the safe-house in Verulam, C 20, who had anything to do with the two abductees from the 7th of July till the time of their death&gt;?</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, Mr Chairman, I know of no other persons involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes.  And do you know of the involvement of any other persons in operations relating to those persons that were conducted by Col Botha or were orchestrated by Col Botha?</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And can I assume that you would have known of other people had this been the case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, that would not necessarily be correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Now your evidence is relating to the arrest of Shabalala, is very different to the evidence that was given by Mr Botha.  You've alluded to that already.  I mean basically the difference is that he testified to the effect that it would have been abundantly clear to Shabalala that Ndaba hadn't been arrested, whereas you're saying that you conducted the operation in such a way that both persons would have assumed that they were arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That was my presumption.</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes.  And Botha makes no mention of you climbing into the back of the car with your colleague and pulling someone, or pulling Mr Shabalala over the back seat, rather he says that he put a gun, I think it was him who put a gun, Botha put a gun into the stomach of Shabalala.  Do you recall that happening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I didn't see the gun in the stomach, but I did pull Shabalala with du Preez over the seat into the back seat and held his head down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That was my part in that action.</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> So it would have been pointless really and possibly pretty dangerous for all parties concerned to pull someone over the back seat of the car, or pull someone over the front seat of the car into the back, if he'd had a gun in his stomach at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Dangerous to whom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Well, first of all the detainee and secondly it could have knocked the gun anywhere and the gun could have gone off, or wouldn't you have noticed that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, I didn't even see Mr Botha with a firearm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Well, I'm suggesting that had that been the case, you would have seen it, because you'd be trained to look out for the position of weapons and the position of everybody in this arrest situation.  I'm suggesting  had that been the case, you would have seen it and you would have noticed it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, I didn't notice.</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What was the time, was it daylight?</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It was lunchtime, I think, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You got into the back of the car and you grabbed this man?</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> du Preez got in the one side and I got in the passenger side of the vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you would have wanted to make very sure that he didn't suddenly pull a gun on you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, I was watching Mr Shabalala.</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You were watching carefully.  Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.  Something that I wanted to clear up, I know it was a long time ago, I want you to try to the best of your recollection to remember  the times for me.  I want to know the time when you were called first of all to C R Swart when you saw Ndaba at C R Swart.</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chair, I can't be specific at all.  I think that was also round midday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And then how long, my understanding from the evidence is that you were one of the first people on the scene when these askaris had arrested and then Mr Taylor came later and then Col Botha came later, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, Sir, I seem to recall I came one of the last.  I think these senior gentlemen were there already.</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Okay.  So you couldn't have seen what happened prior to Botha arriving, obviously?</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, Sir, I didn't see what had happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And the two arresting officers, that is I think Ninela and Sekakane, were they in the office at the stage you arrived?</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I recall Mr Ninela there Sir but I have no recollection of Sekakane at all on that day.  Perhaps he was away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes, alright.  But Ninela was in the same office at the stage you arrived?</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> This is all happening at the end of the passage.  I think he was in the office or out in the passage, but he was there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes.  Can you tell me how long you were at C R Swart before you left to go to the safe-house at Verulam, approximately?</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, I'd hazard a guess of an hour, an hour or two.</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And then the drive from C R Swart to Verulam.  Can you hazard a guess as to how long that would take?</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Approximately 30 minutes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And then it was there that Ndaba was ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Before you go on, is that to Verulam or is that to the safe-house itself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> The safe-house, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.  And then the debriefing of Ndaba commenced at that stage and were you involved in that at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, Mr Chairman, Mr Botha kept us on the side, that was his baby.</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> So you didn't even hear anything, what was said at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> He didn't allow me to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Now, how long did you stay at the safe-house in Verulam?</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, perhaps another hour, hour and a half, or so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And then you would have taken another half an hour ride approximately back to Greyville?</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And then you say you arrived at Greyville at about what time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, not so reliably but perhaps 4 o'clock, half-past 4.</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> You would have been briefed or, I don't know what the military term is, maybe you can help me, you would have been told what was expected of you at Greyville.  An operation would have been planned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And what were you told?</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I was informed that Ndaba was due to meet somebody from his unit.  The meeting was to take place sometime during the course of that afternoon.  It was decided that the meeting should be attended by Ndaba and we were to monitor the meeting and if everything was to go smoothly we would leave it.  If the agent gave the sign and Botha informed us that the sign was to be the touching of the head, it would mean that the source presumed he was in danger and then Botha would tell us how to react and 90% of that reaction would be to affect an arrest of the parties that were all around the source at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Sorry there's a few things.  You say that at the stage that the signal went, it was only then that Botha would tell you how to react?</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That was my understanding.</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes.  So you didn't know what to do if the danger signal was given?</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> React.</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> But you'd have to wait for instructions first.</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That's correct, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Were you told at any stage to make sure that if the danger signal was given that you were to react in such a way that you wouldn't cast suspicion, or you wouldn't create suspicion in the mind of the informer, Ndaba?</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, Sir, we were informed to try and protect the fact that Ndaba was involved in the information leading to that, by our actions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And when were you told of this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> On departure for the operation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Why didn't you tell me that when I asked about your instructions earlier?</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I answered that question as relevantly as I did, when I got it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Now you then arrested Shabalala and you say you and one of your colleagues took him back to the safe house in his car.  Who was driving that car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That was van der Westhuizen.  He drove the blue Corolla, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And what did you do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I stayed in the back holding Mr Shabalala's head down, so he couldn't see anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Were you injuring him at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, I wasn't injuring him at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Were you pointing a firearm at any part of his body at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I hadn't drawn my firearm.  I wasn't pointing my firearm, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And can you demonstrate how you were holding him down?</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> He was now, he had been pulled over.  He was on the back seat and I had my arms around him and I was holding him.  His head was between my legs and I was holding his head down onto the floor of the vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And when you got to Verulam, the safe-house, you say you locked him in a room?</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And what happened to Ndaba?</p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I don't know what happened to Mr Ndaba.  Once we did that action with, at the Corolla, Ndaba went with Botha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes, but the evidence has been that he was also brought to that safe-house.  Were you not aware of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, I was aware of it once I was at the safe-house.  Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Well, sorry if I wasn't clear in my question.  When did you first see Ndaba again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> At the safe-house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And what happened to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> He was taken to a separate room.</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Was he also locked in the room?</p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, he was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And who went into that room?</p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I went into the room. Botha went into the room.</p>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> So you directed your attentions towards Ndaba?</p>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No I was giving both parties my attention.</p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> I understood from your evidence that you left Shabalala in the room, locked, unattended.</p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> If he was locked unattended, I would doubt that.  Perhaps I had secured him, I handcuffed him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes.  What I'm trying to establish is that he was alone.  My inference from your evidence and correct me if I'm wrong, was that you locked him in the room and he was alone at that stage?  I would assume that you would at least have restrained him in some manner.</p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, Sir I did, I handcuffed him formerly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> But he was alone in the room?</p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Initially I stayed with him, until other members came and then I would leave.</p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> So you were alone in the room with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> The two of you, and you locked the room with you in the room alone with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, I secured him in the room Sir.  I see what the statement says, but I secured him in that room and if I had to leave that room, I would lock that room.</p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes and you say you asked him no questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No I had nothing to ask him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> You in fact go further than that and you say you were instructed or advised that he was of no value, don't bother to ask him questions, that's how I understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> At the time that we were briefed of the operation there was no information, or nothing to ask him.  I was briefed as such.</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And who briefed you as such?</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Capt Botha briefed me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes.  Now you then, it seems, must have left him in the room and gone with somebody else into the room where Ndaba was?  Is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, I mingled in between the two throughout the course of the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Well let me get to the point.  Were you involved in the room where Ndaba was questioned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> So you don't know how Ndaba was questioned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> You were never throughout the week involved in any situation where Ndaba was being questioned or interrogated by anybody?</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, further during the week I was.  I thought you were talking about still that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes, okay, well let's establish.  That day you weren't and further on during the week, when did you question Ndaba?</p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> During the week, well I spoke and interviewed with Ndaba. I never really questioned Ndaba.</p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> What were you talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I would talk about personalities in Swaziland.</p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> What about?  Them playing golf?</p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, them being MK.</p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes.  And why, I mean are you implying that this is not interrogation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I'm saying it wasn't interrogation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> It wasn't.  What is your definition of interrogation?  Just so that we can speak the same language, what is your definition of interrogation?  When I ask you the word, interrogate, what is conjured in your mind by that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> What you are doing now, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Is this interrogation?  This isn't interviewing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Now, you asked him about MK people in Swaziland. Is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Amongst other questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> What else did you ask him?  I'm trying to find out what you asked him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, it's many years ago, I would have been asking questions pertaining to my desk of MK Intelligence.  I can't recall for the life of me one question pertinently.</p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> So as I understand it, the focus of your questions was more to establish what he knew about what was going on in Swaziland in MK structures?</p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That's correct, Mr Chairman.  I wasn't that aware of what was going on in Operation Vula at this stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And later on?  When did you become aware of Operation Vula?</p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Botha would then, he then brief me more fully on what was happening in this particular instance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> And when did that briefing occur?</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That took place intermittently after we had been at this house.  He then took me into confidence and started to tell me more and more what had been happening since he had been handling Ndaba.</p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And this was obviously prior to the death of these people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> So can I assume that you were fully appraised of the situation in regard to the seriousness of Operation Vula prior to the death of these two individuals?</p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, Mr Botha briefed me as he deemed fit, I don't know if I was fully appraised with all the facts, but he briefed us to what he deemed necessary for us to know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Well, let me rather rephrase that and say that you were aware that these two people were involved in this people's revolt, or this insurrection that it was termed later and the seriousness of the situation prior to their death?</p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And you were aware that both of these people were involved in this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, Sir, according to Mr Botha's debrief.</p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes.  So did you question Mr Shabalala about his involvement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Why not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I was informed not to speak to him and not to try and recruit him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Who told you that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Botha told us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> So who spoke to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I have no idea.</p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Did anybody?</p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Members of C20 might have spoken to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Do you know if any of your colleagues spoke to him, let's say Mr du Preez?</p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> He may have, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Mr Steyn?</p>
<p class="line" id="line546"><a name="pos546"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, Sir, Mr Steyn never came there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Mr Steyn never came to the Verulam house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line548"><a name="pos548"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> What about Mr van der Westhuizen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Not in my presence, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Have you questioned people to get information out of them before?</p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes. Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> I would imagine that's quite a big part of your job being a Security Policeman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Now, you see what my question is, Mr Wasserman, and what my problem is, is that you become aware of this person who's involved in this major operation which might even involve the overthrow of the negotiations and destabilisation of everything that was going on at the time, and he might have a lot of information, but you don't question him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, Mr Chairman, I had been informed that there were sources inside there and we were told by Mr Botha to play it gently and leave it at that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> But wouldn't it be a fair assumption for me to make that the chances are that Shabalala would have information about Vula that might have helped you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That's a fair assumption.</p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes, and isn't it also a fair assumption to make that if you speak to two people and get information from two people, the chances are you can have more information as a result of that just speaking to the one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That's a fair assumption.</p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And isn't it a fair assumption to say that Shabalala might have been extremely valuable to you in regard to getting information about this operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is a fair assumption.</p>
<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes, so didn't you think it strange that you were asked not to talk to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman there was apparently information emanating from this operation.  Mr Botha had told us and that what his reasons were for not engaging in an operation with Mr Shabalala he never made clear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> No I'm not asking you whether Botha gave reasons at this stage, I might later.  I'm asking you didn't you feel that it was strange that you got this specific instruction not to talk to this person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line566"><a name="pos566"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, Sir I didn't see it as strange.</p>
<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> This valuable, this potentially valuable source?</p>
<p class="line" id="line568"><a name="pos568"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, Sir it wasn't strange.</p>
<p class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Well I put it to you, I find it very strange.</p>
<p class="line" id="line570"><a name="pos570"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It's not a strange thing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Can you tell me why, you see there's a - can you tell me why, or rather let me phrase it in a different way.  Were you under the impression that Shabalala was giving no co-operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> After a couple of days, I was, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> How did you come to that conclusion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> If I went into his room to see how he was and things like that and for food, his body language and he wasn't interested in us at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Do you expect the Committee to believe that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, he had nothing to say to me, he wouldn't engage in any discussions with us, he was not interested, he had nothing, absolutely nothing to say to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> But you've just indicated to the Committee that you had instructions not even to talk to him, not even to ask him questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I didn't ask him questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> No, but I'm saying how can you, if you are, if what you say is true, that you were given orders not to even talk to him and your evidence is that  you obeyed those orders, how can you yourself testify to the effect that this person wasn't co-operating?</p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, as you've said, I have spoken to people on many occasions.  He wasn't to co-operate and I wasn't to question him, therefore everybody was at a position where we knew where we stood.</p>
<p class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> What do you mean, he wasn't to co-operate?  How did you know that if you didn't even speak to him?  That's my point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I never spoke to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Then how did you know he wasn't co-operating?</p>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I don't have to speak to you and you can see that I'm not co-operating.</p>
<p class="line" id="line585"><a name="pos585"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But you arrested this man.</p>
<p class="line" id="line586"><a name="pos586"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It's a human thing.  There was no reason, I was told not to speak to the man.</p>
<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You've arrested this man, you've taken him to a strange house, you have handcuffed him, you have locked him in a room and then you walk into the room and you don't speak to him, you walk out.  You walk into the room, you don't speak to him, you walk out.  How do you expect him to react?</p>
<p class="line" id="line588"><a name="pos588"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Perhaps in the uncooperative way that he did, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line589"><a name="pos589"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> You see, in Mr Botha's application he referred to the person as uncooperative and my understanding is that his lack of co-operation was one of the factors in the assessment of Shabalala, that contributed to the decision to kill him, is that accurate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Well, I made no decision to kill him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> No I realise that, but you've been here hearing the evidence.  I'm asking you on the basis of the evidence that you heard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Well, I must object to that Mr Chairman, that wasn't even nearly the evidence, with great respect.  Far from it.  Botha gave his reasons very explicitly, they're contained in Annexure D, Exhibit D, and it certainly does not contain the consideration that the man was uncooperative.  It had to do with the protection of Ndaba, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line593"><a name="pos593"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> I'll rephrase, Mr Chairman.  Had, surely it would have been a bonus for you if Shabalala had said, "Okay, I don't want to get killed, I'll join you guys and I'll tell you everything you want to know."  That would have been a useful thing to have occurred.</p>
<p class="line" id="line594"><a name="pos594"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It would have been, yes Sir, but it didn't happen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes and had he agreed to go into your askari situation, it would have been a distinct benefit to you and in those circumstances, it seems to me that it would have been strange to put, to make- sorry if I rephrase - had he gone, if he co-operated with you and become an askari he might have been very valuable in your investigations of this Operation Vula?</p>
<p class="line" id="line596"><a name="pos596"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line597"><a name="pos597"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And it is unlikely in those circumstances that he would have been killed, that any person would have taken the decision to kill him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line598"><a name="pos598"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I can't comment on that Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line599"><a name="pos599"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> No, but I mean, if, surely logic dictates, let's escape from this particular situation.  You capture an ANC person, you interrogate him or interview him, he decides to come over to your unit and assist you in your operations, you keep him on.  If he becomes uncooperative and you don't want, and he just indicates clearly that he's not going to co-operate, then the chances are that something else is going to happen to him, possibly he'll be killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line600"><a name="pos600"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That's not necessarily how it happened always.</p>
<p class="line" id="line601"><a name="pos601"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes.  I'm looking at probabilities here.  If he had co-operated with you and told you at that stage that I am going to be one of your askaris, the chances are he wouldn't have been killed?  The probabilities are.</p>
<p class="line" id="line602"><a name="pos602"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> The probability exists, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line603"><a name="pos603"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes.  So then, it seems likely that at some stage he would have been asked whether or not he wanted to become an askari or not, and I use the word asked very generously.</p>
<p class="line" id="line604"><a name="pos604"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Well I never asked him that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line605"><a name="pos605"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> No I'm not saying you did, but I'm talking about your experience as a Security Policeman, that's the probability.</p>
<p class="line" id="line606"><a name="pos606"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It's a probability.</p>
<p class="line" id="line607"><a name="pos607"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes.  And the probabilities are that he refused, because he was killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line608"><a name="pos608"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That's a probability, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line609"><a name="pos609"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes.  So the probabilities are that his refusal to become an askari were one of the factors that led to his early demise?</p>
<p class="line" id="line610"><a name="pos610"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, I don't think that was so, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line611"><a name="pos611"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You've been kept - Counsel is asking you again and again about him becoming an askari, isn't the normal practice, if you arrest, detain somebody like this, to talk to him, to see what information you can get from him, if he starts giving information, if he starts co-operating with you, only then do you suggest that he becomes an askari?</p>
<p class="line" id="line612"><a name="pos612"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line613"><a name="pos613"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Can I just be clear?  Your evidence so far is that you don't know anything about any of the questioning that happened to him, if it happened.  As far as you know, there was no questioning of him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line614"><a name="pos614"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman.  I didn't question Mbuso Shabalala at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line615"><a name="pos615"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And no questioning of him took place in your presence, that's been your evidence today.</p>
<p class="line" id="line616"><a name="pos616"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, Mr Chairman, there was no sessions of questioning in my presence at all to Mr Shabalala, at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line617"><a name="pos617"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So when the C20 people questioned him, you don't know anything about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line618"><a name="pos618"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, Mr Chairman, I don't know if he co-operated or what the situation would have been.</p>
<p class="line" id="line619"><a name="pos619"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You don't even know that they did, in fact.</p>
<p class="line" id="line620"><a name="pos620"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I was informed that they did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line621"><a name="pos621"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> As I understood you and I may have been mistaken, you said, we were told not to question him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line622"><a name="pos622"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, that's myself, du Preez and van der Westhuizen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line623"><a name="pos623"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  The three of you who were in the unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line624"><a name="pos624"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes. Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line625"><a name="pos625"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> None of you, you were all told to leave him alone, not to question him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line626"><a name="pos626"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line627"><a name="pos627"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Not to try to turn him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line628"><a name="pos628"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, correct, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line629"><a name="pos629"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Mr Chairman, just to set the record straight, I want to refer Mr Visser to paragraph 18 of Mr Botha's initial affidavit where he says one of the factors concerning the options relating to Mr Shabalala was the fact that he gives no co-operation.  It's listed as the first factor.  It's on page 18 of the first application to amnesty of the bundle.  Now, did...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line630"><a name="pos630"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I'm sorry, allow me Mr Chairman to apologise and to say that I stand corrected, but that wasn't his evidence here, but I read it here and it is under the heading of Mbuso Shabalala.  "Geleen geen samewerking.  Nie bereid om te getuig nie.  Nie bereid om beruggewer te word nie"  So it would appear that Botha did in fact talk to him about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line631"><a name="pos631"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Thank you.  Were you aware of any of the background of Mr Shabalala, as far as his involvement in the UDF goes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line632"><a name="pos632"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, I wasn't Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line633"><a name="pos633"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Because you used the phrase in your second statement that he had the name "Jack".  Are you sure of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line634"><a name="pos634"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I was informed of that by Mr Botha's debrief of Ndaba, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line635"><a name="pos635"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Well, my instructions are that Jack was the MK name given to Mr Shabalala's brother, Vuso Shabalala and that Mbuso Shabalala, the person you killed, his MK name was David.  Can you dispute that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line636"><a name="pos636"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I cannot dispute that, Mr Chairman.  I thought Mr Shabalala's brother was Rexel, that's the MK, or the code name that I knew.  But there were many names, some persons had four or five.</p>
<p class="line" id="line637"><a name="pos637"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Wee you under the impression that Mr Shabalala was operating outside the country or only inside the country?  Did you know at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line638"><a name="pos638"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Which Mr Shabalala?  Sorry, Mr Wills.</p>
<p class="line" id="line639"><a name="pos639"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Sorry, the detained Mr Shabalala, the deceased.</p>
<p class="line" id="line640"><a name="pos640"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, I'd never heard of him operating externally.</p>
<p class="line" id="line641"><a name="pos641"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Were you aware of him prior to this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line642"><a name="pos642"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, I'd heard of him vaguely via UDF desk discussions, but he'd never come to my attention in the MK  ...that I was responsible with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line643"><a name="pos643"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Now, you've heard the evidence of both Mr Botha and Mr Steyn.  you've also read the affidavits and so you are aware of the fact that they flew off to Pretoria on a number of occasions during that week from their evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line644"><a name="pos644"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I'm aware from their evidence, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line645"><a name="pos645"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes.  Did you not know at the time that they flew to Pretoria from time to time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line646"><a name="pos646"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, Mr Chairman, I was a sergeant, I didn't know, I didn't have to know if they were flying to Pretoria.</p>
<p class="line" id="line647"><a name="pos647"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And you evidence seems clear on the point that at no stage did they call you together and appraise you of the fact that they'd got these instructions not to arrest by the 16th?</p>
<p class="line" id="line648"><a name="pos648"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No I wasn't informed of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line649"><a name="pos649"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes.  And I take it that you weren't informed of the extent to which this Intelligence travelled, that it went as far as the State President.</p>
<p class="line" id="line650"><a name="pos650"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line651"><a name="pos651"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Or intended to go to the State President.</p>
<p class="line" id="line652"><a name="pos652"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, Sir I wasn't informed of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line653"><a name="pos653"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes.  You had no knowledge of the fact that prosecutions would not be instituted against these people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line654"><a name="pos654"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, Sir, I wasn't informed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line655"><a name="pos655"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> You had no knowledge that Col Zen de Beer had been appointed to investigate Operation Vula from a national perspective?</p>
<p class="line" id="line656"><a name="pos656"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I became aware of that shortly, yes, that one I was informed of.</p>
<p class="line" id="line657"><a name="pos657"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And how did that information come about, can you tell us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line658"><a name="pos658"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Col Botha informed us that a national team would be appointed, members from all over the country would come and de Beer, the local Durban man, would head up that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line659"><a name="pos659"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And what did he say you must do with de Beer?  I mean, obviously you knew your position with these two people from Operation Vula?</p>
<p class="line" id="line660"><a name="pos660"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, I had nothing to do with de Beer at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line661"><a name="pos661"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Why not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line662"><a name="pos662"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I had nothing to offer him.  I had no information to give him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line663"><a name="pos663"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Were you not told specifically not to co-operate with de Beer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line664"><a name="pos664"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> We would never have even got to that Mr Chairman, I would not have anything to do with him anyway, I had nothing to give.</p>
<p class="line" id="line665"><a name="pos665"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Well, you had knowledge of the fact that you had two operatives under your control, that seems by all accounts were connected to Operation Vula, surely that would be useful for him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line666"><a name="pos666"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I think Mr de Beer was after the information Sir, and I had nothing to give him, so I had nothing to deal with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line667"><a name="pos667"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> You had information about the whereabouts of two people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line668"><a name="pos668"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line669"><a name="pos669"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> That is information.  That is vitally crucial information to somebody who's trying to solve or to get information on an operation, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line670"><a name="pos670"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> If I had information, it would have been, but I had no information to give Mr de Beer, therefore I didn't even see him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line671"><a name="pos671"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> What I'm suggesting is that you were told not to co-operate with de Beer, is that not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line672"><a name="pos672"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, I understand the question now, Sir.  Yes, Mr Chairman, we were informed not to mention anything about those arrests and those activities, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line673"><a name="pos673"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> But hang on a second Mr Wasserman.  You wouldn't have needed to be informed not to co-operate with, this wasn't your first operation that you were involved in unlawful activities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line674"><a name="pos674"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That's correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line675"><a name="pos675"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> This is in fact almost  your last operation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line676"><a name="pos676"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, Sir, that's why I didn't understand ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line677"><a name="pos677"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You been involved in a stream of killings and unlawful activities all of which you kept hidden for years.</p>
<p class="line" id="line678"><a name="pos678"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct, Sir, that's why I didn't understand exactly what the question coming from Mr Wills was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line679"><a name="pos679"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> But your evidence is that you were actually told to keep it quiet?  That's so improbably.  You guys didn't need to tell each other to keep it quiet, you knew jolly well that you'd broken the law and this thing had to remain a secret.</p>
<p class="line" id="line680"><a name="pos680"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, that's correct.  But I didn't understand exactly where Mr Wills was coming from.</p>
<p class="line" id="line681"><a name="pos681"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Yes, but that's why I'm puzzled by your evidence that you would have got an instruction to keep it quiet.  You would have known very well, you were an experienced policeman, you may be a sergeant, but you were a very experienced policeman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line682"><a name="pos682"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That's correct, Sir, I would not have mentioned it anyhow.</p>
<p class="line" id="line683"><a name="pos683"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...indistinct) at that stage.  All they were doing was detaining somebody.</p>
<p class="line" id="line684"><a name="pos684"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> But even if you hadn't have killed him, you knew that the detention was unlawful.</p>
<p class="line" id="line685"><a name="pos685"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line686"><a name="pos686"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> I just want to dwell on that for a very short while longer.  It seems to me from the evidence of both Mr Botha and Mr Steyn, that there was an active decision taken to conceal, it wasn't just a case of hiding the information, there was an active decision to conceal your activities in relation to the arrests of these two people from de Beer, and that is what you were told.  That is what was told to you, not, to actively not co-operate with de Beer and to actively conceal the fact that you had these two people from de Beer.  Sorry.  I'm sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line687"><a name="pos687"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I don't understand you sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line688"><a name="pos688"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Sorry, I'm tired now,  Let me try and rephrase.  You had a, it seems from my understanding of Botha's evidence is that he made an active decision to conceal the information that he had these two people at the house in Verulam from de Beer.  Did you hear that evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line689"><a name="pos689"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I heard the evidence yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line690"><a name="pos690"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Now what I'm asking, is because you were in his select unit, he had opened, you were privy to this operation of his, but he also told you not to tell de Beer anything about that, about the fact that you had these people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line691"><a name="pos691"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line692"><a name="pos692"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And did you ever have any communications with Mr Steyn, Gen Steyn?</p>
<p class="line" id="line693"><a name="pos693"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, I didn't. Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line694"><a name="pos694"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> So it was always, the only communications that came from Steyn, was via Botha?</p>
<p class="line" id="line695"><a name="pos695"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, Sir, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line696"><a name="pos696"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> I want to turn now to the last days, the last day.  Did you see Ndaba and Shabalala on Saturday morning, the 14th?</p>
<p class="line" id="line697"><a name="pos697"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line698"><a name="pos698"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> How wee they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line699"><a name="pos699"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> They were fine, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line700"><a name="pos700"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> They were fine?</p>
<p class="line" id="line701"><a name="pos701"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line702"><a name="pos702"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> They weren't shaken up, scared, terrified?</p>
<p class="line" id="line703"><a name="pos703"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman to me no not, although Mr Botha had told me Mr Ndaba was an anxious personality.</p>
<p class="line" id="line704"><a name="pos704"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes, but to you he looked fine?</p>
<p class="line" id="line705"><a name="pos705"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line706"><a name="pos706"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> To you, you didn't notice anything strange about him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line707"><a name="pos707"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line708"><a name="pos708"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> You wouldn't have come, told us that he was shaken up, trembling or anything like that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line709"><a name="pos709"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, he wasn't, whilst he was with me, no Sir, he wasn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line710"><a name="pos710"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> You then say to them, or how was it, who communicated to them that you were going to remove them to another safe-house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line711"><a name="pos711"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Botha was taking the lead in that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line712"><a name="pos712"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes, did you witness that communication?</p>
<p class="line" id="line713"><a name="pos713"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line714"><a name="pos714"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> What happened, tell me how?  I mean, from your point of view, I want you to go into as much detail as you can and I want you to be sensitive to the fact that I'm asking this question because the loved ones of those two people are here, they want to know what happened to their loved ones.  What happened that morning?  You got - what time did you go to work, or what time did you wake up from the safe-house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line715"><a name="pos715"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, I can't recall if I stayed at the safe-house that night, but I do know that we took Shabalala and Ndaba to a kombi, station wagon kombi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line716"><a name="pos716"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And who told you to do this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line717"><a name="pos717"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Botha told us to do it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line718"><a name="pos718"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And when had he told you this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line719"><a name="pos719"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Earlier on in the day, before the evening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line720"><a name="pos720"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> What time are you talking about?  When did you get into the kombi?  What time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line721"><a name="pos721"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, I can't recall the time but it was night time, late night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line722"><a name="pos722"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Late night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line723"><a name="pos723"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line724"><a name="pos724"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> On the Saturday night, the 14th?</p>
<p class="line" id="line725"><a name="pos725"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line726"><a name="pos726"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And when had Mr Botha told you to put them in the kombi or take them to the kombi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line727"><a name="pos727"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That was minutes- when did he tell me to put them in the kombi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line728"><a name="pos728"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes.  Or should I rather say, when did you know, you've told us that  you got an order, you got an instruction from Mr Botha that you were to assist in their elimination, when did that order come?</p>
<p class="line" id="line729"><a name="pos729"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That was earlier on in the evening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line730"><a name="pos730"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Earlier on in the evening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line731"><a name="pos731"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I can't recall, it was on the day, late afternoon, evening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line732"><a name="pos732"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Okay.  And then sometime at night you put these people in the kombi.  Did you lead?  Did you lead to the kombi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line733"><a name="pos733"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, before that Mr Botha told me and then I prepared, he told me how he was going to - he decided to take them to the Tugela, then I got hessian sacking and some Watcrete concrete pole standards and some wire, some binding wire and I put that in the kombi.  I then, I had pre-cut strands of wire into predetermined lengths.</p>
<p class="line" id="line734"><a name="pos734"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> You had all of this equipment at this house in Verulam?</p>
<p class="line" id="line735"><a name="pos735"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It was a farmhouse.</p>
<p class="line" id="line736"><a name="pos736"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> You had it all there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line737"><a name="pos737"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It was all there yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line738"><a name="pos738"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line739"><a name="pos739"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I cut wire up in predetermined sizes and also loaded that into the kombi, then when that was all ready, we took the parties out of the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line740"><a name="pos740"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> When you say we, I want you to tell me, who did you take out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line741"><a name="pos741"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I'm unable to state which member I took out, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line742"><a name="pos742"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Were you all three of you involved at this stage,  or all four of  you?  By that I mean all applicants except Gen Steyn?</p>
<p class="line" id="line743"><a name="pos743"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line744"><a name="pos744"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Were their hands cuffed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line745"><a name="pos745"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes they were, Sir.  They were handcuffed and blindfolded.</p>
<p class="line" id="line746"><a name="pos746"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Okay.  And where did you put them in the kombi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line747"><a name="pos747"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> They were led into the back of the kombi, through the sliding door, into the back of the kombi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line748"><a name="pos748"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> As I understand your evidence, you weren't present at the time it was communicated to them that they were going to be moved to another safe-house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line749"><a name="pos749"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I don't recall that I was present Sir, although I knew that would be the legend given to them, but I wasn't present when Mr Botha said it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line750"><a name="pos750"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes.  Now did they show any signs when you were moving them from the room in that house to the kombi that they knew that they were going to be murdered?</p>
<p class="line" id="line751"><a name="pos751"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, Sir, nothing visible was shown to them.  I think that they still believed that they were going to go to another house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line752"><a name="pos752"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes, okay, you got them into the car and who was driving the kombi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line753"><a name="pos753"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I recall van der Westhuizen drove the kombi Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line754"><a name="pos754"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And where did you sit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line755"><a name="pos755"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I sat behind the people, Ndaba and Shabalala.</p>
<p class="line" id="line756"><a name="pos756"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> So you sat in the third row of seats.</p>
<p class="line" id="line757"><a name="pos757"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> The third or the second, Sir, I don't know, I can't recall if the kombi had two or three rows.</p>
<p class="line" id="line758"><a name="pos758"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> My understanding of a kombi, unless it's been modified, it's got a font seat, it's got a middle seat and it's got a back seat and behind the back seat is the shelf with the engine underneath and a place on the top.</p>
<p class="line" id="line759"><a name="pos759"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That's it, then I was in the middle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line760"><a name="pos760"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And where were the deceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line761"><a name="pos761"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> They were in the front.</p>
<p class="line" id="line762"><a name="pos762"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> In the front with van der Westhuizen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line763"><a name="pos763"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, in the front of the back.  In the front portion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line764"><a name="pos764"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Oh, so you were in the back seat of the kombi, they were in the middle seat and van der Westhuizen was driving?</p>
<p class="line" id="line765"><a name="pos765"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, Sir, correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line766"><a name="pos766"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And where was Mr Botha?</p>
<p class="line" id="line767"><a name="pos767"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, I don't recall exactly where he was in the kombi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line768"><a name="pos768"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And the other applicant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line769"><a name="pos769"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No I don't recall.  I think Botha might have been in the front with van der Westhuizen, but that's speculation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line770"><a name="pos770"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line771"><a name="pos771"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> And du Preez and I were sitting with, in the rear for sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line772"><a name="pos772"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes.  And It's about an hours drive to the turn-off, maybe 15 minutes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line773"><a name="pos773"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct, Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line774"><a name="pos774"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And what was said in the kombi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line775"><a name="pos775"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, there was no conversation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line776"><a name="pos776"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Now I understand this, this is when the old road was in operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line777"><a name="pos777"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line778"><a name="pos778"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> So there's about a 15 kilometre stretch on dirt from the turn-off at Mandini to the Tugela Mouth, might be 12 kilometres, but at least 10?</p>
<p class="line" id="line779"><a name="pos779"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I think it is, yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line780"><a name="pos780"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes, it is and what did you tell them when you were turning off the road?</p>
<p class="line" id="line781"><a name="pos781"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, both parties were unable to see where they were going so there was no reason to say anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line782"><a name="pos782"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> You didn't pre-warn them that you were going to stop in order to relieve yourselves?</p>
<p class="line" id="line783"><a name="pos783"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line784"><a name="pos784"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> You just turned off the tar road and turned, drove seemingly the 15 kilometres or so, or the 10 kilometres to the River Mouth on the Northern side of the Tugela River?</p>
<p class="line" id="line785"><a name="pos785"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line786"><a name="pos786"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And that was a dirt road, that is a dirt road still today.</p>
<p class="line" id="line787"><a name="pos787"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I think it's still a dirt road, I haven't been lately.</p>
<p class="line" id="line788"><a name="pos788"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> But it was a dirt road at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line789"><a name="pos789"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line790"><a name="pos790"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Was there any discussion in the car with the applicants?</p>
<p class="line" id="line791"><a name="pos791"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line792"><a name="pos792"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> What happened when  you stopped?</p>
<p class="line" id="line793"><a name="pos793"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> When we stopped van der Westhuizen and I got out of the vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line794"><a name="pos794"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, may I ask.  Seeing that we're trying to complete this incident by tomorrow, what the point is of repeating all the evidence in chief in cross-examination?  With great respect.  If there's a point, obviously I don't have any problem, but aren't we just wasting time,?  We're going through exactly the same evidence as he's given before Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line795"><a name="pos795"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Mr Chairperson, I am asking additional questions.  I don't recall there being any questions asked about conversations taking place, who was sitting where, what was said to the parties, this is to my mind, fair in the circumstances.  This is the only evidence that the families are going to hear about the last day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line796"><a name="pos796"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think you should bear that in mind Mr Visser that it was explained that it was explained that they are appearing for the families of the people and they wished to know exactly how their sons had died and we are getting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line797"><a name="pos797"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman, I'm not getting sensitive to that but Botha also already gave the evidence.  But I leave it in your hands, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line798"><a name="pos798"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line799"><a name="pos799"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, Sir.  Must I ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line800"><a name="pos800"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes, you see, what I'm trying to suggest is that surely at that stage, when you told them that they must get out and relieve themselves, that any person in those circumstances would at least get a suspicion or be at least a little bit scared that something was going to happen to him then,</p>
<p class="line" id="line801"><a name="pos801"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, it wasn't evident, perhaps both parties were apprehensive but they never stated, they never said anything and they didn't openly show anything, but I don't know what their feelings would have been at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line802"><a name="pos802"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> And you said that they must relieve themselves?</p>
<p class="line" id="line803"><a name="pos803"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman, we all did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line804"><a name="pos804"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes, did you take their handcuffs off?</p>
<p class="line" id="line805"><a name="pos805"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, Mr Chairman, they were handcuffed in front of themselves, not at the back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line806"><a name="pos806"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> So who helped them undress, or was it possible with handcuffs on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line807"><a name="pos807"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, it's possible with handcuffs, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line808"><a name="pos808"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Did you take their blindfolds off?</p>
<p class="line" id="line809"><a name="pos809"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, they remained blindfolded, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line810"><a name="pos810"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> You say you then led them, or somehow they got to the river bank, I'm assuming that the, I think you indicated that it was about 20 metres away from the car.  How did they get there?  Who led them there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line811"><a name="pos811"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, I am of the opinion that maybe Mr du Preez and Botha perhaps led them that way.  We all went.  The two of them and the three of us, but not van der Westhuizen, he stayed with the vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line812"><a name="pos812"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> At all stages?</p>
<p class="line" id="line813"><a name="pos813"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> At one stage, after the shooting..(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line814"><a name="pos814"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> No, I'm talking about before the shooting.  I realise what happened, what he did after.</p>
<p class="line" id="line815"><a name="pos815"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Before the stage, yes Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line816"><a name="pos816"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line817"><a name="pos817"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, when we got there initially, he took me from the vehicle to this place, 20 or 30 metres or so, then came back and then he stayed there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line818"><a name="pos818"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And you say you made them sit down?</p>
<p class="line" id="line819"><a name="pos819"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line820"><a name="pos820"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And how did you do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line821"><a name="pos821"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Well after relieving, we all relieved ourselves, then after that I suggested, "Let's sit here, we're not ready to move yet", then even I sat down.  All of us sat down and then the two gentlemen were shot on either side of me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line822"><a name="pos822"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes, but the evidence has been to the effect that you made them sit down.  Did you ask them to sit down and they co-operated, or did you push them down?  Sorry, I know that I was concentrating on something else when you gave this evidence in chief.</p>
<p class="line" id="line823"><a name="pos823"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman, we had discussed with Botha that I would attempt to get them to sit down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line824"><a name="pos824"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line825"><a name="pos825"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Surreptitiously and I said "listen, we are not ready to leave, let us sit down" and I placed my hands on their shoulders.</p>
<p class="line" id="line826"><a name="pos826"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Both of them at the same time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line827"><a name="pos827"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, Sir, and started to sit downwards and they sat down with me.  Then very, very shortly after that both shots went off, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line828"><a name="pos828"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> So even when you were making them sit down, surely then they would have at least gasped or indicated something, because they must have been terrified?</p>
<p class="line" id="line829"><a name="pos829"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, I think that they were not aware that they were about to be shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line830"><a name="pos830"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When did Botha tell you that you should try to get them to sit down?</p>
<p class="line" id="line831"><a name="pos831"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, he had made this plan up at the house, at the house in Verulam.</p>
<p class="line" id="line832"><a name="pos832"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> We've heard of how you disposed of their bodies, I won't dwell on that.  You had given evidence, or there has been evidence that you operated in a number or you had a number of farms at your disposal.  You had at least two that I know of, the one in Camperdown and the one in Verulam.  Is that not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line833"><a name="pos833"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line834"><a name="pos834"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Now it seems to be strange that you go to the trouble of taking them all the way to the Tugela River where you could have just done the same job at the farm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line835"><a name="pos835"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That's correct, Mr Chairman and even to me that decision was strange when it came.</p>
<p class="line" id="line836"><a name="pos836"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes, it's strange to me as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line837"><a name="pos837"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You see, particularly in the light of the fact that you already killed somebody on that farm before and buried them there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line838"><a name="pos838"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman, I had no idea where this plan of the river had come from, it was totally out of normal context.</p>
<p class="line" id="line839"><a name="pos839"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Prior to your application, did you become aware that there was a unit investigating this killing that was under the auspices, I think it was known as the d'Oliveira Unit, under the auspices of the then Transvaal Attorney-General?</p>
<p class="line" id="line840"><a name="pos840"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line841"><a name="pos841"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> This was prior to your amnesty application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line842"><a name="pos842"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I'm not too sure if it was prior but I knew Mr d'Oliveira was working on this one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line843"><a name="pos843"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Now I've spoken to the Investigating Officer, Mr Holmes and I was hoping at this stage to have the statements and I've just spoken to him.  Did you know that Capt Holmes was the Investigating Officer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line844"><a name="pos844"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, I didn't know that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line845"><a name="pos845"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Well, I've spoken to him telephonically and unfortunately I'm not in a position to verify this with documents, but at this stage he says to me that he has information that Ndaba and Shabalala were not killed at the same time.  you deny that obviously?</p>
<p class="line" id="line846"><a name="pos846"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I deny that emphatically.</p>
<p class="line" id="line847"><a name="pos847"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> He also indicated to me that he had information and I don't know what the state of this information is, but that Ndaba was taken out in a Natal Parks Board boat and his body was blown up some miles off the coast.</p>
<p class="line" id="line848"><a name="pos848"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, that's incorrect, Sir.  That's nonsense.</p>
<p class="line" id="line849"><a name="pos849"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> This evidence appears to be vital to the whole application.  If it is true, if there is such evidence, it is quite clear there has not been full disclosure.  What arrangements are being made to have this evidence made available to the hearing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line850"><a name="pos850"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Mr Chairperson, I've asked Capt Holmes to give me that evidence.  I spoke to him on Friday last week.  he indicated to me that he would have this evidence available by Monday afternoon.  Unfortunately when I got hole of him, I only traced his number down on Friday, when I got hold of him on Friday afternoon he was in some operation in the Eastern Cape and he was expected back to his offices on the Saturday.  He indicated to me that on the Saturday he would look through the information and give it to me.  I spoke to him on the Monday morning, he indicated that he'd been delayed in the Eastern Cape but that he would endeavour to give the information to me.  I'm still expecting it Mr Chairperson.  I have asked the Truth Commission, in the form of Ms Deborah Quinn, to assist in this process but we haven't been successful at this stage and that's, I don't have any power to get hold of this information other than that.  I am expecting affidavits to come through.  Mr Chairperson I didn't, I raised this information at this stage obviously because it would be fair for me to put this to this witness.  The information I've just revealed now was given to me as a result of a telephone conversation with Capt Holmes on Monday morning after the cross-examination of Mr Botha had been completed, but I would certainly appreciate assistance from the Committee as far as getting Holmes here.  It would assist me greatly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line851"><a name="pos851"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It seems to me that if there is such evidence, it should be made available, it should be put to the witness.  Is it possible to continue his cross-examination on other aspects and to continue, we will do all we can to make sure such evidence, if it is evidence, is made available and can be put before the Committee.  Obviously it's something which should be put to Botha certainly if it's going to say that his version is completely false and we have to put to the other applicant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line852"><a name="pos852"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairperson, we agree with you.  The - Please allow me say that it is startling that after two years down the line when everybody knew in the TRC of these applications, that we should be faced with this 90% through our, or 80% through our applications.  It is just really unacceptable, but Mr Chairman, as usual we will not complain, we will fall in, because clearly we want to know what the truth is and we agree with you, but can my learned friend just tell us everything that Holmes told him?  We now know of two things.  Is there more, may we ask, Mr Chairman?   And what's - surely my learned friend must have asked him, "But why do you say this, what is this based on?  Is there somebody that can tell us?"  I mean surely there must be more information?</p>
<p class="line" id="line853"><a name="pos853"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> The only, I mean I don't know if I'm obliged to answer questions about consultations I have with witnesses but be that as it may, the only information that I have got related to that, but related to the two facts that I've given and to my recollection of the telephone conversation I had with Holmes, the impression I gained was this was through his investigations and I assumed it was through information contained in the dockets.  I did request that statements be faxed to me to the number at, in the media room.</p>
<p class="line" id="line854"><a name="pos854"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> May we assume that this is then all that he said?  These two points.</p>
<p class="line" id="line855"><a name="pos855"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> At that stage, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line856"><a name="pos856"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, may I ask, I don't see that there should but could there be any objection to my attorney talking to him so that we can find out exactly what he's got and when it can be brought to you because Mr Chairman, we can't just keep on postponing the completion ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line857"><a name="pos857"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I want our investigator to take over now through our Leader of Evidence and we will be responsible for such evidence then being made available.</p>
<p class="line" id="line858"><a name="pos858"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I suggest that my learned friend completes the cross-examination of this witness, pending on whatever may come out from Mr Holmes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line859"><a name="pos859"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson, I've just got one issue that I want to raise which is related, that is, in your experience as a Security Policeman, surely, or isn't it common practice that when you have an informer who supplies you with information about persons who may at a later stage be arrested, that it would be a common practice to keep that informer in order to communicate with that informer to corroborate information that is gleaned from the persons who are arrested or detained by some other means?</p>
<p class="line" id="line860"><a name="pos860"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That would be a usual practice, yes Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line861"><a name="pos861"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes, so it would be quite an unusual thing to have killed this informer at this stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line862"><a name="pos862"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line863"><a name="pos863"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Do you know why?  Are you able to advance any reason to the Committee why this unusual step was taken?</p>
<p class="line" id="line864"><a name="pos864"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, Mr Chairman, personally I am unable to really know why this step was taken.</p>
<p class="line" id="line865"><a name="pos865"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line866"><a name="pos866"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Mr Wills, can I just clarify something?  The two issues that arose from your discussion with Mr Holmes were that they weren't killed at the same time and which of them was allegedly blown up at sea?</p>
<p class="line" id="line867"><a name="pos867"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ndaba.</p>
<p class="line" id="line868"><a name="pos868"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes, Ndaba.</p>
<p class="line" id="line869"><a name="pos869"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> I just wanted to be clear, so my note is correct, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line870"><a name="pos870"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> That completes my cross-examination, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line871"><a name="pos871"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR WILLS</p>
<p class="line" id="line872"><a name="pos872"></a><span class="speaker">MS POSWA:</span> Thank you Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line873"><a name="pos873"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS POSWA:</span> Mr Wasserman, you state in paragraph 4 that you were surprised by the news of Mr Ndaba's arrest in view of the high profile.  Can you explain what you mean by this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line874"><a name="pos874"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, Mr Chairman, not the arrest.</p>
<p class="line" id="line875"><a name="pos875"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> He was surprised that he was his informant, not by the arrest.  Sorry, just to get the question right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line876"><a name="pos876"></a><span class="speaker">MS POSWA:</span> What do you mean by high profile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line877"><a name="pos877"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Well Mr Ndaba was a high profile, according to my knowledge, he was a high profile MK Commander from MHQ.</p>
<p class="line" id="line878"><a name="pos878"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He was Commander of the operations in Natal, wasn't he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line879"><a name="pos879"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> He was at one stage, then he retreated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line880"><a name="pos880"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you also know that Mr Shabalala was high profile, similar high profile?</p>
<p class="line" id="line881"><a name="pos881"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, I was unaware of his status, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line882"><a name="pos882"></a><span class="speaker">MS POSWA:</span> When did you come into contact with the name Ndaba?  When did you first come into contact with his name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line883"><a name="pos883"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, I can hazard a guess.  It would have been in my Swaziland Operations, probably 84/85, at a guess.</p>
<p class="line" id="line884"><a name="pos884"></a><span class="speaker">MS POSWA:</span> Oh you were in Swaziland 84/85?</p>
<p class="line" id="line885"><a name="pos885"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No I operated in Swaziland, but I was in Durban basically.</p>
<p class="line" id="line886"><a name="pos886"></a><span class="speaker">MS POSWA:</span> Okay.  Now you say that, to your knowledge, no assault took place at C R Swart?</p>
<p class="line" id="line887"><a name="pos887"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Not in my presence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line888"><a name="pos888"></a><span class="speaker">MS POSWA:</span> Not in your presence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line889"><a name="pos889"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line890"><a name="pos890"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry your mike please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line891"><a name="pos891"></a><span class="speaker">MS POSWA:</span> Sorry, and you were in the presence of these two all the time that they were there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line892"><a name="pos892"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, I was not in their presence all the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line893"><a name="pos893"></a><span class="speaker">MS POSWA:</span> You were not?  Okay.</p>
<p class="line" id="line894"><a name="pos894"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line895"><a name="pos895"></a><span class="speaker">MS POSWA:</span> Now you say when you proceeded with the arrest of Shabalala at the meeting-place by Greyville Racecourse, you explained how the whole operation occurred, but I'd just like to highlight the fact that Mr Botha in his evidence, said that what he had, what your objective had been at that stage once Ndaba gave the signal, it was to protect Ndaba, would you agree with that?  Your objective, your common objective, once the signal had been given by Ndaba that he was in danger?</p>
<p class="line" id="line896"><a name="pos896"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman, any action taken by us was to protect Ndaba.</p>
<p class="line" id="line897"><a name="pos897"></a><span class="speaker">MS POSWA:</span> Your objective of the whole action?  But your account here has just been that your, the object of your, of the whole operation was to arrest both of them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line898"><a name="pos898"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, Mr Chairman, that's the wrong impression, I hope that's not the impression ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line899"><a name="pos899"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, I gathered from the evidence, that he said the intention was to create the impression that they had arrested both of them after it had gone wrong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line900"><a name="pos900"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct, yes, that's the impression Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line901"><a name="pos901"></a><span class="speaker">MS POSWA:</span> Okay, so you wouldn't agree with Botha's assertion that in fact Ndaba could have gleaned, Shabalala could have gleaned from that whole operation of arrest, that Ndaba was not being arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line902"><a name="pos902"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, it is possible that he did glean that, that we were attempting to stage a charade that he would not glean that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line903"><a name="pos903"></a><span class="speaker">MS POSWA:</span> Thank you.  We have evidence from Mr Botha yet again that Shabalala refused to be recruited, what do you say to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line904"><a name="pos904"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That's very possible and I was not present when Botha even tried once to recruit him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line905"><a name="pos905"></a><span class="speaker">MS POSWA:</span> I don't think I got the reason precisely why you were told not to try to recruit him.  Why was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line906"><a name="pos906"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That reason was never given to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line907"><a name="pos907"></a><span class="speaker">MS POSWA:</span> In the usual course of your business of arrests you would have tried to turn a person over, would you not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line908"><a name="pos908"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman we would have engaged in a questioning session should the reaction of that person be as such, then one might have tried a recruiting job on that personality.</p>
<p class="line" id="line909"><a name="pos909"></a><span class="speaker">MS POSWA:</span> Had you previously been told not to try and recruit an arrested person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line910"><a name="pos910"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Many times.</p>
<p class="line" id="line911"><a name="pos911"></a><span class="speaker">MS POSWA:</span> You have been.</p>
<p class="line" id="line912"><a name="pos912"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line913"><a name="pos913"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> And you never questioned it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line914"><a name="pos914"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line915"><a name="pos915"></a><span class="speaker">MS POSWA:</span> Okay.  On paragraph 12 you say that Shabalala was robust and aggressive throughout, can you just expand on that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line916"><a name="pos916"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Well, Mr Chairman, if I attempted to have anything to say to Mr Ndaba, correction, to Mr Shabalala, he would have absolutely nothing to say to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line917"><a name="pos917"></a><span class="speaker">MS POSWA:</span> Is that aggression?</p>
<p class="line" id="line918"><a name="pos918"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Well, perhaps not in the strict sense of the word, however he would have nothing at all to do with me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line919"><a name="pos919"></a><span class="speaker">MS POSWA:</span> Is that what you mean by robust and aggressive?</p>
<p class="line" id="line920"><a name="pos920"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Perhaps abrasive is another word, but it was definite from his reaction that there would be no dealings between the two of us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line921"><a name="pos921"></a><span class="speaker">MS POSWA:</span> This just doesn't add up.  You were told not to have anything to do with Mr Shabalala but you are able here to assert that he was robust and aggressive.  The two just don't tie up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line922"><a name="pos922"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Well, Mr chairman, I would have had to go and see that he was okay in the room, that perhaps he needed to relieve himself, we had to take him food, we had to take water, so those were the dealings that I routinely would have had with him, but I never had discussions over activities and actions that he might be doing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line923"><a name="pos923"></a><span class="speaker">MS POSWA:</span> So, in hiss aggression what did he do, did</p>
<p class="line" id="line924"><a name="pos924"></a>he refuse when you said you may go and relieve yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line925"><a name="pos925"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line926"><a name="pos926"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you have to be present when he had to relieve himself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line927"><a name="pos927"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, there was no toilet facilities right in that room, so he would have had to be taken to do his ablutions and we took them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line928"><a name="pos928"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And have his handcuffs taken off?</p>
<p class="line" id="line929"><a name="pos929"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line930"><a name="pos930"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It must have been most humiliating.</p>
<p class="line" id="line931"><a name="pos931"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I think so, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line932"><a name="pos932"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Sorry, sorry if I may interpose.  The word robust, what do you understand by the use of that word?  Why did you choose that word?</p>
<p class="line" id="line933"><a name="pos933"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I think it should have been rather more proud and forthright, but robust was selected.</p>
<p class="line" id="line934"><a name="pos934"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Because robust means to be physical, to be more than just body language, which is what you used in evidence in chief.</p>
<p class="line" id="line935"><a name="pos935"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Then perhaps it's the wrong word, I didn't understand robust to be that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line936"><a name="pos936"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And aggressive has a similar denomination.</p>
<p class="line" id="line937"><a name="pos937"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It's words selected in consultation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line938"><a name="pos938"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> It's just that the impression imparted by the use of those two words together, gives one the impression that he might even have tried to physically attack you back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line939"><a name="pos939"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, Sir, he didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line940"><a name="pos940"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> At no stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line941"><a name="pos941"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line942"><a name="pos942"></a><span class="speaker">MS POSWA:</span> Thank you.  We'll go now to the observation at the Knoll.  Can you just clarify?  Where was Gen Nyanda arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line943"><a name="pos943"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> He was arrested going up the road towards Overport, I don't recall the name of the road.</p>
<p class="line" id="line944"><a name="pos944"></a><span class="speaker">MS POSWA:</span> And before the arrest you were observing the resident, called the Knoll.</p>
<p class="line" id="line945"><a name="pos945"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line946"><a name="pos946"></a><span class="speaker">MS POSWA:</span> When he left the Knoll, you followed him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line947"><a name="pos947"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line948"><a name="pos948"></a><span class="speaker">MS POSWA:</span> Why had you been asked to observe that place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line949"><a name="pos949"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Botha had informed us that this was a safe-house for the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line950"><a name="pos950"></a><span class="speaker">MS POSWA:</span> An ANC safe-house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line951"><a name="pos951"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line952"><a name="pos952"></a><span class="speaker">MS POSWA:</span> Had he told you who to observe there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line953"><a name="pos953"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I don't recall which names he mentioned, but we were to record all particulars of all personalities exiting and leaving.</p>
<p class="line" id="line954"><a name="pos954"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> Did you know Gen Nyanda?</p>
<p class="line" id="line955"><a name="pos955"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I knew Kibusa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line956"><a name="pos956"></a><span class="speaker">MS POSWA:</span> I knew the name Kibusa and I knew Kibusa was Gen Nyanda.</p>
<p class="line" id="line957"><a name="pos957"></a><span class="speaker">MS POSWA:</span> Okay..</p>
<p class="line" id="line958"><a name="pos958"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> And I knew the face, Ma'am.</p>
<p class="line" id="line959"><a name="pos959"></a><span class="speaker">MS POSWA:</span> Okay.  So I didn't quite get what you said he did that made you, alerted you to the fact that you were onto him.  What did he exactly do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line960"><a name="pos960"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, I think his counter surveillance procedure, because he's a highly trained man, I think his counter surveillance procedures had picked us up.  His driving mannerisms appeared to both du Preez and I that he was starting to take slightly evasive action and we both came to the conclusion that perhaps he had cottoned on to us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line961"><a name="pos961"></a><span class="speaker">MS POSWA:</span> Can you just explain the driving mannerism, what was he doing?  Swerving the car, going faster, slower?</p>
<p class="line" id="line962"><a name="pos962"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Nothing as dramatic as swerving the car, however, I seem to recall perhaps and indicator, showing going left and then not going left and then an indicator</p>
<p class="line" id="line963"><a name="pos963"></a>going right, to see if we were responding behind. That's routine anti-surveillance procedures and it appeared as though those were being practised.</p>
<p class="line" id="line964"><a name="pos964"></a><span class="speaker">MS POSWA:</span> And then you went on to say that a particular weapon was discovered in the car whereas you had searched the car and not found the weapon.  How do you explain that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line965"><a name="pos965"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, my search was very, very cursory.  We didn't strip that car at that stage for secret compartments, it was merely a physical search of the vehicle as it was standing there per se.</p>
<p class="line" id="line966"><a name="pos966"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I tend to recollect, but I'm not sure, if it was in this case or something else, that the weapons were found in a secret compartment in the fuel tank?</p>
<p class="line" id="line967"><a name="pos967"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, I was just looking, I think it was in Gen Steyn's Exhibit H, where he recounts the judgment of the Magistrate in Mr Nyanda's application for bail, but I'm not entirely certain.  I'm just looking through that now, Mr Chairman and if I find it, I will alert you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line968"><a name="pos968"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> It's on page 5 of that annexure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line969"><a name="pos969"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you Commissioner Lax.  I'm just looking.  I see there's something on page 6 as well about explaining that tanks of a Mercedes and a Cressida, well he was driving a Cressida, was used to smuggle arms.  I'm just looking again, Mr Chairman.  I'm not sure where at page 5 you're referring to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line970"><a name="pos970"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> No, in fact you're correct there.  It's the second-last sentence of that first paragraph on page 6, talks about</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line971"><a name="pos971"></a>"the Accused explained that the tanks were used to smuggle arms and ammunition from Botswana into the Republic.  This was done on numerous occasions."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line972"><a name="pos972"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It would appear to indicate, if one looks at the sentence just before that the modified petrol tank were found at the house.  It may be somewhere else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line973"><a name="pos973"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, certainly this does not narrow it down to a secret compartment in a car, Mr Chairman.  My attorney has just pointed out to me something else here and that is at page 96 on The Other Side of the Story where the photographs which I referred to earlier, page 198, I dealt with and it says at page 97</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line974"><a name="pos974"></a>"The photographs 198 illustrate the Toyota Cressida, ND 268230, found in possession of Siphiwe Nyanda, showing the false compartment and the M3A1 45 calibre sub-machine gun with the optical sight and silencer."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line975"><a name="pos975"></a>So according to these commentary Mr Chairman, apparently it's the middle photograph and I'm going to hand it to you again so that you look at it, it would appear to be the seat turned upside down with some sort of compartment.  My attorney can just show that to you, Mr Chairman, it gives him something to do as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line976"><a name="pos976"></a><span class="speaker">MS POSWA:</span> So Mr Chair, we can proceed on the assumption that the weapons were found under the seat in a secret compartment.  Thank you, Mr Chair.  Can I continue?  You say that you were told that Ndaba was anxious and indicated his intention to turn himself over the ANC.  Would you normally be privy to such information?</p>
<p class="line" id="line977"><a name="pos977"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> As Mr Botha wished, I could have received such information yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line978"><a name="pos978"></a><span class="speaker">MS POSWA:</span> Earlier on you said he had not permitted you is some discussions, well which discussions were those?  In discussions with Ndaba.  You said earlier on that he had not permitted you in the room when he was discussing with Ndaba yet he walks out of the room and gives you the exact information Ndaba gave him, does that make sense?</p>
<p class="line" id="line979"><a name="pos979"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, it makes Ma'am.  Then I cannot put questions to Mr Ndaba.</p>
<p class="line" id="line980"><a name="pos980"></a><span class="speaker">MS POSWA:</span> Pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line981"><a name="pos981"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That means I would not be able to question Mr Ndaba on information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line982"><a name="pos982"></a><span class="speaker">MS POSWA:</span> Okay, if you're in the room  you would, it would have been assumed that you can question Ndaba, but if you're outside, you couldn't?</p>
<p class="line" id="line983"><a name="pos983"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That's right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line984"><a name="pos984"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And if you're outside, you are relying only on what you are told by Botha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line985"><a name="pos985"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That is correct, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line986"><a name="pos986"></a><span class="speaker">MS POSWA:</span> When was the decision taken to eliminate Ndaba?</p>
<p class="line" id="line987"><a name="pos987"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I'm not sure when that was taken Mr Chairman, but I was, my participation came about earlier on the day in question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line988"><a name="pos988"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> When were you informed of that decision and, well let's just first, when were you informed of the decision?  On that day?  What time of day, can you remember?</p>
<p class="line" id="line989"><a name="pos989"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chair, as I answered before I cannot give the time but it was earlier on the same day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line990"><a name="pos990"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Was it in the morning, was it in the afternoon, was it early evening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line991"><a name="pos991"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Somehow I recall sort of eventide.</p>
<p class="line" id="line992"><a name="pos992"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You said earlier didn't you, afternoon, early evening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line993"><a name="pos993"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line994"><a name="pos994"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Late afternoon, early evening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line995"><a name="pos995"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And as a consequence of that you had certain preparations to perform?</p>
<p class="line" id="line996"><a name="pos996"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That's correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line997"><a name="pos997"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And that entailed getting hessian sacking, it entailed getting the Watcrete poles, according to your evidence it entailed cutting bits of bailing wire to certain lengths and so on, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line998"><a name="pos998"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman, once I'd been informed that it's been decided that they were to be placed in a river and what my part would be I then prepared, on grounds of that instruction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line999"><a name="pos999"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And where did you get all that material from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1000"><a name="pos1000"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman at the farm at Verulam, there was an old Hulett's farmhouse, there was much poles, wire, hessian bagging and all of that stuff was at the farm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1001"><a name="pos1001"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Please carry on, sorry to interrupt you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1002"><a name="pos1002"></a><span class="speaker">MS POSWA:</span> Thank you.  Now did the repercussions that this would have, the fact that Ndaba and Shabalala were to be eliminated on the National Party as explained in paragraph 18, did you reach this conclusion on your own, or where did you get this information?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1003"><a name="pos1003"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> I was just reminding you to put the mike on, you did it as I mentioned it to you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1004"><a name="pos1004"></a><span class="speaker">MS POSWA:</span> The concerns raised in paragraph 18.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1005"><a name="pos1005"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Sorry Mr Chair, I just missed the gist of that question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1006"><a name="pos1006"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You're being asked, these concerns that you raise here in paragraph 18 about the way the decision was taken and the basis for that decision, where did you, how did you come to know about these concerns?  Have I put the question correctly?  Did you ...(indistinct- mike not on).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1007"><a name="pos1007"></a><span class="speaker">MS POSWA:</span> Were you personally concerned about the repercussions that the elimination of Ndaba and Shabalala would have on the National Party?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1008"><a name="pos1008"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I was aware that there would be repercussions, should it be established what had happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1009"><a name="pos1009"></a><span class="speaker">MS POSWA:</span> Were you concerned about those repercussions as stated in paragraph 18?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1010"><a name="pos1010"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> What repercussions exactly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1011"><a name="pos1011"></a><span class="speaker">MS POSWA:</span> Should I read out the paragraph?  Paragraph 18 of his statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1012"><a name="pos1012"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Mr Wasserman, you can see paragraph 18, it's pretty obvious that there are a whole range of issues contained in it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1013"><a name="pos1013"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes Sir, I'm aware of the issues but are those repercussions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1014"><a name="pos1014"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Well during the period of time when the negotiations were under way, these revelations would have caused a sensation and would have embarrassed the National Party and the Government.  Those are the repercussions she's talking about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1015"><a name="pos1015"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, I concur with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1016"><a name="pos1016"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Yes, but the question you're being asked is, did you personally have a worry that that in fact would be the result?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1017"><a name="pos1017"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1018"><a name="pos1018"></a><span class="speaker">MS POSWA:</span> You were not told this by Mr Botha?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1019"><a name="pos1019"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I believe that I was also told this by Mr Botha, but I did further concur with it by myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1020"><a name="pos1020"></a><span class="speaker">MS POSWA:</span> How far did you say the safe-house was from the Tugela River?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1021"><a name="pos1021"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, distance wise...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1022"><a name="pos1022"></a><span class="speaker">MR POSWA:</span> An estimation will do, Mr Wasserman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1023"><a name="pos1023"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> 80 kilometres.  80/90 kilometres.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1024"><a name="pos1024"></a><span class="speaker">MS POSWA:</span> So your testimony is that for 80 to 90 kilometres, you drove 80 to 90 kilometres in total silence to the Tugela?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1025"><a name="pos1025"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I didn't speak at all to either Ndaba or Shabalala.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1026"><a name="pos1026"></a><span class="speaker">MS POSWA:</span> But you spoke amongst yourselves?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1027"><a name="pos1027"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, we spoke amongst yourselves.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1028"><a name="pos1028"></a><span class="speaker">MS POSWA:</span> What would you say the mood was amongst yourselves as you proceeded to carry out this mission?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1029"><a name="pos1029"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> The mood was a sombre mood but we were going at lengths to show that it was not abnormal.  Like that, there was nothing, I'd deem it as a normal trip.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1030"><a name="pos1030"></a><span class="speaker">MS POSWA:</span> That is you wanted to conceal it from the two people you were with, Mr Ndaba and Mr Shabalala?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1031"><a name="pos1031"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, Ma'am.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1032"><a name="pos1032"></a><span class="speaker">MS POSWA:</span> You wanted to conceal it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1033"><a name="pos1033"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1034"><a name="pos1034"></a><span class="speaker">MS POSWA:</span> If the Chair will bear with me.  Now your evidence has been that you did all this in the course of your duties.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1035"><a name="pos1035"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman this is really, I haven't opposed or objected to this before, but really it's a question of legal argument.  The learned Commissioner Lax has already put this to Mr Wills before.  It's a matter of legal argument and frankly Mr Chairman, a lot of time might be saved if my learned friends would read the Khotso House judgment, because that is where this issue was dealt with by the Amnesty Committee Mr Chairman.  We're really just wasting time with these questions.  This witness can't answer legal questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1036"><a name="pos1036"></a><span class="speaker">MS POSWA:</span> Mr chair, I do not believe that, I would like to know the mind-set of the applicant when he is carrying this out.  Did he believe that he was carrying out his duties, was he aware that the instructions were unlawful in the circumstances?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1037"><a name="pos1037"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I have no objection to that question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1038"><a name="pos1038"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, I was aware that these were unlawful instructions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1039"><a name="pos1039"></a><span class="speaker">MS POSWA:</span> But you carried them out anyway?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1040"><a name="pos1040"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct, Mr Chairman.  It was my belief that I was still fighting the war and the conflicts of the past to the best of my ability.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1041"><a name="pos1041"></a><span class="speaker">MS POSWA:</span> What, under normal circumstances, were you required to do when given unlawful instructions by a senior policeman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1042"><a name="pos1042"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I beg your pardon.  Would you just say that again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1043"><a name="pos1043"></a><span class="speaker">MS POSWA:</span> What were you required to do once given an unlawful instruction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1044"><a name="pos1044"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Usually one would not comply with such an instruction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1045"><a name="pos1045"></a><span class="speaker">MS POSWA:</span> Why in this case did you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1046"><a name="pos1046"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I saw it as part of my duties in fighting the onslaught that we were faced with at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1047"><a name="pos1047"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The acts were unlawful, they were against the common law of our land, but did you believe these instructions were coming from the government, from the top?  Not directly, but the authority was derived from them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1048"><a name="pos1048"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, I did so, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1049"><a name="pos1049"></a><span class="speaker">MS POSWA:</span> No further questions, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1050"><a name="pos1050"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS POSWA</p>
<p class="line" id="line1051"><a name="pos1051"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1052"><a name="pos1052"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Yes, Mr Chair, I do have questions, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1053"><a name="pos1053"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS THABETHE:</span> Mr Wasserman, at paragraph 10 of your statement, you say that in view of the fact that Ndaba was already a Security Branch informer, you go on and then you say</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1054"><a name="pos1054"></a>"I was given to understand that we were not interested in any information which Shabalala might be able to give us."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1055"><a name="pos1055"></a>What does that mean?  I don't quite get the meaning of that statement, "I was given to understand that we were not interested in any information which Shabalala might be able to give us"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1056"><a name="pos1056"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, I was of the opinion that as Botha was handling Ndaba as an agent, we were not to be, not to go for Shabalala for information as Ndaba was already able to feed on to Botha the information that Shabalala might have been in possession of.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1057"><a name="pos1057"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> When you say we, who are you referring to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1058"><a name="pos1058"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I'm referring to that unit that was involved.  That'll be du Preez, van der Westhuizen and myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1059"><a name="pos1059"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> And who gave you that information that Shabalala might not be able to give you an information?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1060"><a name="pos1060"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That was Botha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1061"><a name="pos1061"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Botha?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1062"><a name="pos1062"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1063"><a name="pos1063"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> So Botha gave you an instruction that you shouldn't worry about Shabalala because you wouldn't be interested in the information that Shabalala would give?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1064"><a name="pos1064"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Not to worry about Shabalala, Ndaba has the information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1065"><a name="pos1065"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Right.  Now, my next question is, if Botha thought that Shabalala would not have any information that would be of interest to you, you in plural, why was Shabalala detained in the first place?  What was the purpose of detaining Shabalala, because Ndaba had already given the information and as far as your evidence goes, Botha said you don't need Shabalala.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1066"><a name="pos1066"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Shabalala was detained, wasn't he, to save Ndaba?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1067"><a name="pos1067"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Sorry Mr Chair, Shabalala was detained to save Ndaba?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1068"><a name="pos1068"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He gave the signal in the car, didn't he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1069"><a name="pos1069"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> That was the reason for detaining Shabalala?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1070"><a name="pos1070"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Do you mean his continued detention?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1071"><a name="pos1071"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1072"><a name="pos1072"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Okay, well that's subtly different.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1073"><a name="pos1073"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Okay, okay, thank you Mr Lax.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1074"><a name="pos1074"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Now I'm, now I'm mixed up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1075"><a name="pos1075"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> The question is, if Shabalala was of no use to you, because all the information was going to come from Ndaba and that's what you were told and that's what you surmised you told us, what is the point in holding Shabalala, continuing to hold him?  Have I put the question correctly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1076"><a name="pos1076"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Yes, Mr Lax, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1077"><a name="pos1077"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Well, Mr Chairman, I really don't know the particulars why we held onto Mr Shabalala that long.  Mr Botha might know why he was kept behind for so long.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1078"><a name="pos1078"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Mr Wasserman, in your evidence you have indicated that Mr Shabalala's head was down when he was arrested.  Would you say he saw what happened to Ndaba thereafter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1079"><a name="pos1079"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> He wouldn't have seen what happened after I had his head down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1080"><a name="pos1080"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Right.  Then my question with regard to that is, on paragraph 12 of your statement, you say the problem became compounded when it appeared that Shabalala in effect suspected Ndaba of working with the police.  When did Shabalala - and then you go on to say, "I remember him saying as much", when did Shabalala say this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1081"><a name="pos1081"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It would have been one of the nights, or one of the days, a couple of days after we had taken him to the safe-house in Durban.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1082"><a name="pos1082"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> And to whom did he say this?  Did he say this to you?  Or were you present when he said this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1083"><a name="pos1083"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> He said it to me.  I believe he said it to some of the other people that were there as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1084"><a name="pos1084"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Maybe I'm confused a bit, I thought your evidence had indicated you did not speak to Shabalala and Shabalala did not speak to you back, so I'm just a bit confused, at what stage did Shabalala speak to you and say that he's suspecting Ndaba might be working with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1085"><a name="pos1085"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, after four days, some form of chatting did take place, but there was nothing - there was no questioning on MK activities or anything like that.  There was - within four days one has to say something to one another, but it wasn't discussions, interrogations, interviews, it was nothing like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1086"><a name="pos1086"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Yes, I must say I've got difficulty understanding that, that - I don't know where you say it, but you say he did not co-operate with you, you went in and you went out, there was no conversation and then all of a sudden he says that he suspects that Ndaba is working with the police.  Do you have any response to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1087"><a name="pos1087"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, I cannot recall, I don't know if other people said to me that they've spoken to Shabalala and he's of the opinion that he was set up by Ndaba.  I really don't recall.  I spoke to  hundreds of MK operators.  I cannot exactly recall who said what here but whilst in that house over that period of time, I was informed or I came to the conclusion that Shabalala did indeed at one time have an conclusion that Ndaba may have set him up for an arrest.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1088"><a name="pos1088"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It wasn't that Ndaba was an informer, but that Ndaba had set him up, but from the facts that Ndaba was the person who apparently led the police to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1089"><a name="pos1089"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, Sir, as an informer yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1090"><a name="pos1090"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Can I just raise something here?  You may have formed that impression.  I'd like to suggest to you that its highly unlikely he said to you he suspects Ndaba.  no operative's going to give away the fact that he suspects the other guy you've got there.  It's highly unlikely.  You see, the reason I say this is that you didn't question Shabalala.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1091"><a name="pos1091"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1092"><a name="pos1092"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And all you heard about were the attempts by the C20 people to ask him certain questions.  He was very uncooperative.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1093"><a name="pos1093"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1094"><a name="pos1094"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Why would he then admit that he suspected Shabalala?  Sorry that he suspected Ndaba of selling him out because by doing that he's automatically admitting to being in a certain position.  Do you see what I'm saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1095"><a name="pos1095"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Setting him up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1096"><a name="pos1096"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Same thing, setting him up, it works the same way both ways.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1097"><a name="pos1097"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, I cannot really put a state of affairs before the Committee of exactly what happened there.  During those couple of days I was informed exactly how, or if the question came to me, but Shabalala had formed the opinion or the conclusion or been told by a slip up of C20, I don't know, I cannot pass comment, but that Ndaba was involved in his capture and therefore working with us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1098"><a name="pos1098"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Except that Mr Wasserman, unless this paragraph doesn't give the clear picture.  You see this paragraph 12 says</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1099"><a name="pos1099"></a>"The problem became compounded when it appeared that Shabalala in fact suspected Ndaba of working with the police"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1100"><a name="pos1100"></a>And then  you go on to say:</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1101"><a name="pos1101"></a>"I remember him saying as much."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1102"><a name="pos1102"></a>So it suggests that you actually heard Shabalala saying this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1103"><a name="pos1103"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, it does suggest that, but it might have been somebody saying to me that he had said that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1104"><a name="pos1104"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> So it's not true that you actually heard him yourself saying it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1105"><a name="pos1105"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I cannot give that evidence before the Committee, that I specifically heard that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1106"><a name="pos1106"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Now my other problem that I would like you to clarify for me with regard to this is, how could Shabalala reach that conclusion or on what basis would Shabalala reach the conclusion that Ndaba was working with the police because when he was arrested, he did not see what happened to Ndaba and the evidence is that they were both detained in the same safe house, so my question is on what basis would he reach this decision because he did not see Ndaba being arrested.  He did not see what happened to Ndaba and he might have known that Ndaba is detained in the same safe-house with him.  I don't know whether I have to repeat my question.  My question is on what basis did Shabalala reach that conclusion that Ndaba is working for the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1107"><a name="pos1107"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No Mr Chairman, I am not able to state on what basis if it was in fact so.  I don't know on what basis Shabalala would have known that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1108"><a name="pos1108"></a><span class="speaker">MS THABETHE:</span> Thank you Mr Chair, I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1109"><a name="pos1109"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS THABETHE</p>
<p class="line" id="line1110"><a name="pos1110"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Any re-examination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1111"><a name="pos1111"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No re-examination, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1112"><a name="pos1112"></a>NO RE-EXAMINATION BY MR VISSER</p>
<p class="line" id="line1113"><a name="pos1113"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You said that when you first saw Ndaba, you didn't - he wasn't ever assaulted in your presence.  What was his condition on that morning or that afternoon, early afternoon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1114"><a name="pos1114"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, when I arrived there, he was sitting in a chair, no signs of assault.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1115"><a name="pos1115"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Now, you've told us about what happened to Shabalala when Ndaba gave the signal and you all converged on the vehicle and what happened to Ndaba in that moment of convergence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1116"><a name="pos1116"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, Mr Chairman, I'm unable to say where he was.  I entered straight away into the vehicle at the back, so I don't know what happened to Mr Ndaba, whether he walked away, ran away, I don't know, I didn't visibly see what happened to him, I was putting all my attention onto Mr Shabalala.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1117"><a name="pos1117"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Had he not been in the vehicle?  Had he been standing next to the vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1118"><a name="pos1118"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> No he was sitting in the front passenger seat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1119"><a name="pos1119"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, he was in the vehicle Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1120"><a name="pos1120"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So, you don't recall how he got out of the vehicle, if anyone took him out, if any words were spoken to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1121"><a name="pos1121"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, Mr Chairman, he was the subject of Mr van der Westhuizen's attention, not of mine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1122"><a name="pos1122"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> When did van der Westhuizen then get into the vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1123"><a name="pos1123"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, he got into the vehicle after Mr Shabalala was in the back with myself and du Preez.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1124"><a name="pos1124"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And Botha?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1125"><a name="pos1125"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I never saw him until the safe-house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1126"><a name="pos1126"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So you have no recollection of what Botha did during this "arrest"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1127"><a name="pos1127"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> After du Preez said "we've got the order, let's go, the signs been given" even prior to that I hadn't seen Mr Botha, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1128"><a name="pos1128"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You see Botha's evidence was that he approached the driver's seat.  He approached and he stuck his hand through the window, he had his firearm in his hand and he told him words to the effect of "Be calm, don't do anything silly".</p>
<p class="line" id="line1129"><a name="pos1129"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, I recall that evidence being heard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1130"><a name="pos1130"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> But you have no independent recollection of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1131"><a name="pos1131"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, Mr chairman, I don't recall seeing him, however, he must have placed himself on the spot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1132"><a name="pos1132"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And as far as you were able to, you didn't see what he did?  As far as you're concerned.  Your own testimony.  You heard him give that evidence, that's one thing.  You have no recollection of what he did whatsoever?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1133"><a name="pos1133"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, Mr Chairman, I don't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1134"><a name="pos1134"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Now, you've said that on the 12th van der Westhuizen was busy with observation due to his Brickhill Road, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1135"><a name="pos1135"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1136"><a name="pos1136"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And you and du Preez were at the Knoll?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1137"><a name="pos1137"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Correct, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1138"><a name="pos1138"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> And we've heard the evidence of Botha that it was only the  three of you that were guarding these two, so who was guarding them on the 12th when you were busy with your observations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1139"><a name="pos1139"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> The C4 members, I believe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1140"><a name="pos1140"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> I beg your pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1141"><a name="pos1141"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I believe perhaps the C4, the C20.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1142"><a name="pos1142"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> You see, he told us that only the three of you were guarding.  It's also his evidence that the C20 people had no idea that these people were - anything unlawful to do with them.  Now they were never left there unattended at any stage, that's self-evident.  How could the three of  you be out on other duties, when according to his evidence, you were supposed to be guarding them?  At lease one or two of you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1143"><a name="pos1143"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Well, Mr Chairman, perhaps he was referring to the Durban members, but if we were not there at all at the time, then C20 were also policemen and they could also do the guarding but they were really, I would presume, to be out responsibility as Durban members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1144"><a name="pos1144"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Now Botha's told us that the C20 people had no knowledge of the unlawfulness of their detention.  What legend did you give them?  They stayed there for a couple of days.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1145"><a name="pos1145"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> That's correct, Mr Chairman, I never saw fit to give them any explanation.  I'm not sure what Mr Botha would have said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1146"><a name="pos1146"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> But listen, I've been to that house.  Let me tell you straight, I've been, I've seen its layout, I observed the exhumation there, it's not a huge house, it's a relatively small house, it's about four or five rooms at the most, if I remember correctly.  Are you talking about the house where the body was buried?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1147"><a name="pos1147"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I don't believe I am, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1148"><a name="pos1148"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Pumuza Ncweni?  he was exhumed on that farm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1149"><a name="pos1149"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, Mr Chairman, no, sorry Sir, it's a different house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1150"><a name="pos1150"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Is this a different place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1151"><a name="pos1151"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1152"><a name="pos1152"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> So there were two safe-houses in the Verulam area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1153"><a name="pos1153"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, there were two.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1154"><a name="pos1154"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Fair enough, I won't take that aspect any further.  If the layout of the house was different, and we're talking about two completely different places, so be it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1155"><a name="pos1155"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, I think Mr Botha said Blackburn, in his evidence, did he not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1156"><a name="pos1156"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> I think he did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1157"><a name="pos1157"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Different house to the other one, which is also at Verulam.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1158"><a name="pos1158"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> I think the other one was called Churchill or something like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1159"><a name="pos1159"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Waterloo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1160"><a name="pos1160"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Waterloo, that was it.  Thank you.  The last aspect I wanted to just touch on was, surely the fact that nobody questioned Shabalala and that he was not being interrogated would give him the impression that something was strange here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1161"><a name="pos1161"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> I don't dispute that, Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1162"><a name="pos1162"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Because yesterday Gen Steyn conceded that the whole conduct towards Shabalala would have increased the chances of him suspecting Ndaba and was totally out of sync with what you normally would have done in those circumstances.  Would you agree with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1163"><a name="pos1163"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Yes, Sir, it was wrong and it was out of sync.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1164"><a name="pos1164"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Now, if it was the intention from the very beginning to simply eliminate these two people, then it wouldn't have mattered whether they realised Ndaba was an informer or not, whether Shabalala realised, and what it might be argued is that your conduct and the conduct of all of you present there, is consistent with that course of action, in other words with the intention to kill from the outset.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1165"><a name="pos1165"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, no, I had no idea that there was going to be any elimination on the outset, I was led to believe that Ndaba was in fact an agent of the branch.  It would never have occurred to me that we were to eliminate an agent of the branch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1166"><a name="pos1166"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Did the fact of Botha's eliminating his own agent not strike you as strange?  That he did it himself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1167"><a name="pos1167"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It struck me as very strange, Mr Chairman, very strange indeed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1168"><a name="pos1168"></a><span class="speaker">MR LAX:</span> Thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1169"><a name="pos1169"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> I'd just like some clarification on one issue Mr Wasserman.  When you were instructed to keep surveillance at the two safe-houses of the ANC, let me first ask you this, who gave you the instructions to go there and to keep observation there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1170"><a name="pos1170"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> It was Mr Botha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1171"><a name="pos1171"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Now did it come up at all that it might be at some stage or other, become necessary to effect any arrests there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1172"><a name="pos1172"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, no, it never became evident upon instructions of arrest, because as far as I was concerned it was to be an Intelligence operation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1173"><a name="pos1173"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> So there were no guidelines, or no directives given to you in regard to possible arrests?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1174"><a name="pos1174"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> Nothing given to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1175"><a name="pos1175"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> How did you consider your position?  Did you think that you could arrest or that  you should be careful in effecting arrests?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1176"><a name="pos1176"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> We knew that the first principle was to observe and identify all parties visiting these premises and it was a very intricate SACP ANC operation, but as for specifics of arrest, I personally was never instructed one way or the other.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1177"><a name="pos1177"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> The reason why I'm asking you this question, Mr Wasserman, is because it did seem strange to me that Mr Botha did not deem it fit to sort of warn you about not making arrests and he seemed to indicate in his evidence that he was quite comfortable that no arrests would be made.  Do you have any comment on that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1178"><a name="pos1178"></a><span class="speaker">MR WASSERMAN:</span> No, Mr Chairman, perhaps, he was the colonel on the spot, perhaps he should have given a clear instruction one way or the other.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1179"><a name="pos1179"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Thank you.  Thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1180"><a name="pos1180"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1181"><a name="pos1181"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, it seems that we've come to the end of this day.  Perhaps, Mr Chairman if we might take up a little bit of your time by seeing you in chambers and try to arrange our lives for tomorrow, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1182"><a name="pos1182"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, we're going to have to adjourn.  Till what time should we adjourn?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1183"><a name="pos1183"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Tomorrow morning 9.30 Mr Chairman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1184"><a name="pos1184"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well we're now adjourning till 9.30 tomorrow morning.</p>
