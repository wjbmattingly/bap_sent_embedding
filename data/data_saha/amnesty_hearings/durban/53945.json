People from Lupapa were attacked and they were driven out of the area but the police did not take an action, they did not arrest those perpetrators.  The area Umgugamisa was also attacked.  People from Tamele were also attacked.  A few of them remained near Mr Delongo's area.  It was just a few of us remaining.  After a while those people from the farms returned and they resided in the area.  At that time I was no longer residing at Empangesi but Umbumbulu.

I did discuss the matter with the police.\n\tOn a certain day a certain police officer, Mr Mnengbe, informed me that he would no longer be able to fetch me because the people from the farms were complaining and I informed him the reason for their complaint is that they want to kill me.  Mr Mnengbe said he was no longer going to pick me up.

I remained in a ...(indistinct) forest on the lookout for these people.  I waited there until dusk fell.  Thereafter I returned to the Ingite home.  They then prepared tea for me.  As I was still drinking tea I was with Vyasan Luluva.  The dogs started barking outside.  I then thought this must be the people I had been waiting for because the house was along the road so they wouldn't approach from that road.  I then decided to cock my firearm.  A person then kicked the door in.  I then realised this person was in a fighting mood so I started firing and then after that there was a load noise firing from all around.  I told everyone else to lie on the ground and I'd be the only person firing back.  It was obvious to me these people were heavily armed.  When I ran out of ammunition and I could hear from the sound that was going on outside that they were also running out of ammunition, they were changing cassettes.  I then found that the heaviest noise was coming from below.  I then decided to throw the hand grenade in that direction.  I was in a rondawel and I threw the hand grenade from the top of the rondawel and threw it to that direction where the loudest noise came from.  I then fell down to the ground and cocked my firearm again, ready.\n\tAfter throwing the hand grenade I heard a woman's voice screaming, \"Mandle, these are the police, they are not the attackers.\"  I was surprised that they hadn't said anything.  Why didn't they announce themselves?  They were aware that there was fighting going on, why didn't they announce themselves and produce their badges?  Why should we have to exchange such gunfire?  \n\tThe station commander then approached and he said \"yes, we are the police\" and I didn't understand because at the time there were people who went around killing people and they will do this in the name of the police so I did not believe him at first.\n\tAnother police officer, Mr Njangasi, approached.  I knew this Njangasi well so I recognised his voice.  At that time I realised that these were the police and I thought of shooting myself and unfortunately I had run out of ammunition.  They then asked for everybody else to leave the room and I was afraid that they might shoot me because I was an ANC person so I was afraid to come out, I remained in the rondawel but then everyone else persuaded me to come out and not be afraid.  I then did so and I was apprehended outside the rondawel.  They then started assaulting me, asking me where the firearms were I had nothing else besides the one that was in the house.",

            "Mr Chairperson, well of course it is my humble submission that the offence which occurred on the 23rd 1993, it cannot be said to be committed under the political objective.  It's further my submission that although it has been said by my learned friend the witness who has just testified is not in a position to gainsay as to the political perception in the area.  Mr Chairperson, well it is my submission that we are not dealing with a situation a stage where in the '80s the ANC was already banned and there was a free political activity and as a person who is anchored in that particular community, being a police officer, he has been here for the past eight years, he knows the political barometer and as to the political perception of the people of the area, he's in a better position to know actually as to what was happening.\n\tNow the only reasonable conclusion, the context in which the act was committed, again Chairperson it's further my submission that it cannot be said there was a political objective in the sense that it was clear that the applicant in this instance, he had absconded with the criminal case which was pending which the affidavit stated that people were approaching, members of the police force, then he opened a gunfire that some of the police members were affected.  Therefore Chairperson, it is my submission that as for the aspect whether then Sibo or Sepo Mkhize, we are talking about two different areas.  Sibo Mkhize as of course the witness has testified, Sibo Mkhize and Sepo Mkhize, they were staying in a totally different area which happened to be at Umbumbulo which is a distance away from mid Illovo and I further submit, Mr Chairperson, that given the conflict what was happening at KwaZulu at that time, there was this general perception that the IFP it was given that the IFP be the ZP, that is the KwaZulu Police were in line with the IFP but in this instance which as of course the evidence has been led before this, the victims then, which was quite considered by the applicant in this instance that the police officers at mid Illovo, they were under the area of jurisdiction of South Africa which necessitated they were under SAPS vis-a-vis not under KwaZulu Government which can indicate a little level of political bias in executing their duties.  Mr Chairperson, on the strength of that what I've highlighted, it is my submission Mr Chairperson, that this offence when that was committed there was no political objective.  That is all.",

            "Thank you Chairperson, if I can just contribute.  Chairperson, it is not disputed that there were differences between two groups in that area and as a result of which the applicant had to shoot at somebody hence the victims were shot at, that is the actual reason which apparently caused the shooting in the mind of the applicant at the time on the evidence before us.   Then it therefore shifts the focus on what were the causes of this difference between these two groups which is described by the police as a faction fighting and nothing else.  Then I would therefore say, Chairperson, that the Committee has to be careful now not to just dismiss it as a mere faction fighting which was happening there, especially given the fact that one of these groups was dominated by the Mkhizes and it has since transpired in this evidence that the Mkhizes have got a history of being ANC members and they have got a history of a ...(indistinct) with the police for that matter.  So it would be highly improbable to just say that this was just a mere faction fighting and for that matter we don't have an explanation as to exactly what were the causes of this fighting expect for the version of the applicant who was, he himself, involved in the conflict personally.\n\tSo that being the case, Chairperson, I would say that in the circumstances the probability is that there was in fact really a fight between the ANC and whatever, if it was not IFP.  Thank you Chairperson.",

The Panel will have to consider all of the evidence and the arguments that were addressed to us carefully in order to come to a decision on the application before us.  Under those circumstances we will take time to consider the matter, we will reserve our decision and once that is available which we will try to do as soon as the circumstances allow us given the other demands the resources of the Panel and our Committee and we will then notify the parties as to the outcome of the application.  So in the circumstances the decision will be reserved.\n\tWe extend our thanks to Mr Panday and Mr Sibeko and Mr Mapoma for your assistance and for all of the interested parties who have contributed towards this matter and towards trying to come to an understanding as to what was actually taking place at this particular stage at this particular place. \n\tIt concludes the sitting of the Committee as well, it takes care of the roll that we had here.  Before we adjourn the proceedings also extend our thanks to everybody who have assisted us in making it possible to have the hearing here for these past few days in Durban.  There's always a lot of effort that goes with having a hearing of this nature taking place and running smoothly as this one has and as they in most instances do we are always aware of the effort that goes with that and we're always grateful for everybody who contributes, to our interpreters, the rest of our staff and the proprietors of this venue for making their venue available to us for use for these purposes and for any members of the public who have come along to listen to the proceedings, that is also an important aspect, part of the process from our point of view.  We are always grateful for that.  We will now adjourn the proceedings.\nHEARING ADJOURNS",
