<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Did you grow up in a western community or were you brought up in a more traditional Zulu way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> It is traditional.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Did you comply with the Zulu tradition, for example slaughtering animals?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> Yes.</p>

<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> How did you come to join the IFP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> My parents were IFP members and I started liking it because my parents were supporters of it.  I became one of its members and I got a membership card.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Did you have any specific authority in the IFP for example a chairman of something?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> No, I was just an ordinary member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> The incident that took place on the 5th of March 1993 for which you are applying for amnesty, how did it come about that you decided to commit this offence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> On 2 March 1993, the IFP children on their way to school, in a van, were murdered.  This happened in Maqongqo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Do you know by whom?</p>

<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> And when you decided to commit this act was there somebody else with you? Did you discuss this matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> Yes, there were other people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Who was with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> Nkanyiso Wilfred Ndlovu and Makhekhe chistopher Zondi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Mr Ndlovu is the second applicant here with you today, who was also convicted with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Where did this meeting take place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Let's just before you go to that. You see Mr Alberts he's talked about school children being killed. You haven't asked him where, what time, when, shouldn't that be cleared up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Yes. The school children who were killed do you remember their names?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> Yes, I remember their names.  I knew Wa Khumalo, a certain Mkhize, a Gwala girl.  please give me a chance to remember some of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In the meanwhile can you tell us where were these children killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> They were killed in Table Mountain area, at Mboyi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Do you know how this incident took place? What happened during this incident when the children were killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> No.  I was not there.  I was at home and heard gun shots.  i then got into the army car that was proceeding there, where the kids were injured.  When we arrived there ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He wasn't there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> I was there when they were killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What did you see there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> I found the kids there.  Some of them were already dead and some were injured but could still talk.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> And this person that the people told you was involved, who was he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> He was Qeda Zulu.  He was also a resident of Camperdown.  My neighbour.  Thereafter, he fled the area and went to stay in Nkanyezini.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Yes who is he?  Why would he have been involved in the killing of these children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> ...[no English translation]</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Had they tell you what had happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> I asked the children what had happened and they said they had been shot.  They said Qeda was amongst those people who shot them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Why would this Mr Zulu have been involved in the attack on the children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> He is an ANC member.  The parents of the children who were attacked were IFP members.  Perhaps Qeda hated their parents and that is why he attacked these children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> They say it could be, is that what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> I think he killed them because they were staying in the IFP area and their parents were IFP supporters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> What was the situation in the Tableview area at that time, was it peaceful?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> There was violence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> What resulted in the violence?  What was the reason for the violence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What was the cause?</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> The cause for the violence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> It was between the IFP and the ANC supporters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Can you tell us what caused the violence between the IFP and the ANC?  What caused them to fight against each other?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> The ANC supporters were attacking us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Okay, after the incident of the children being killed you had a meeting with the other two people you mentioned, what was decided or discussed at that meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> After the attack on the children, I talked to Makhekhe and told him that we had to avenge this.  I thought a revenge was necessary this was not the first time that the ANC supporters had attacked us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Where was this discussion held?</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> We were near Mkhize's house where the children were killed.  I was there to offer support as a youngster, because the adults were mourning.  Sepiwe was also there.  I then discussed with him that we had to avenge, and he agreed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> What did you then decide to do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> We discussed that our target should be Nofu's kombi that was driven by Qeda Zuma.  We chose this kombi because it is the one that was used by ANC supporters to attack IFP supporters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Was it only you and Makhekhe at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Okay what did you do to implement your plan?</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> We decided to approach Nkanyiso who had a better knowledge about the movements of this kombi.  We then went to Nkanyiso</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just give us the name of the person so that we can write it down properly.  Who did you go and discuss this with, who did you go and talk to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> Nkanyiso.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can you spell that name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> N-K-A-N-Y-I-S-O.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes how do you spell that name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> N-K-A-N-Y-I-S-O.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And his surname?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> The second applicant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Oh I am sorry the second applicant. Yes carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Is that the second applicant in this application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> That is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> What happened when you met up with Mr Ndlovu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> We got into Makhekhe's car and proceeded to Nkanyezini to look for Nkanyiso.  We found him at Ngidi's stored and took him with us.  On our way, we told him about our plans.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> We asked him to explain to us the movements of this kombi.  He did that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> We then influenced him to be with us when we attacked that kombi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Where did you go to then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> We then went to Makhekhe's house because all our discussions happened in the car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Yes and at Makhekhe's house what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> We waited at Makhekhe's house, thereafter Makhekhe took out three firearms, an AK 47, a shotgun and R1 rifle.  He gave an AK 47 to Nkanyiso, an R1 rifle to me and carried a shotgun.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> When was this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> He took out three firearms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> What kind of weapons was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> It was an AK 47, a shotgun and an R1 rifle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> What did you do with the three weapons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> To kill.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> What weapon did you take?</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> I had a rifle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> And the second applicant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> He had an AK 47.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> And Makhekhe the shotgun. Okay what did you then do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> Thereafter he sprinkled us with muti.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> We then planned where we were going to attack that kombi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Did you then go to that place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> We decided that it should be on a deserted road coming from town.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Which town?</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> Pietermaritzburg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Did you then go to that place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> Yes, we went there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> And when you got there what did you do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> We slept there because we arrived during the night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> We waited since 4 o clock in the morning for the kombi to drive past there ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Yes, and what happened on the following morning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> Yes.  We went for this kombi driven by Qeda.</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Why were you waiting, were you waiting for a specific kombi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Okay and did the kombi eventually arrive?</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> Late in the afternoon, this kombi came.  When we saw it approaching, we started shooting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> How far were you from the kombi when you started shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> We were as far from here to the wall there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Approximately 10 to 15 metres.</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> With respect Mr Chairperson, I estimate that distance to be 8 metres.</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> I agree.</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> As the Committee pleases.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Tell us in detail what happened from the time you started shooting at this vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> When we saw it approaching and was not far from us, we started shooting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> How many shots were fired?  How many shots did you fire?</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> I fired until the magazine was empty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Do you know how many rounds an R1 magazine can take?</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> There were twenty rounds of ammunition.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> And after the magazine was empty did you reload?</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> No, I did not.  I had two magazines.</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Did you use both magazines?</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> Yes, I used both but did not finish the second magazine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Do you know how many shots the second applicant and the third person fired?</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Could we just come back to the second.</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> I did not count.</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You say the second casket wasn't finished, how many bullets did you use from that one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> I did not see how many were left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Did you move ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think his answer was he didn't know how many bullets his companions fired.</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Was there a lot of shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> It was a long time when we started shooting at it.  We were still shooting at it when it drove past us until it stopped.</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> And did you shoot at, during all of this time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> And after the kombi stopped?</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> After it stopped, we approached it and were still shooting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> When we approached it we realised that our victims were not the people we were looking for.  The kombi was not carrying the ANC supporters but the members of the public.  We also saw that there were females in the kombi, but we went on shooting. Although we had seen that these commuters were women, we went on shooting because they were staying in the ANC area.  We wanted the ANC to feel what we felt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> And eventually when the shooting did stop what did you do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> After we shot at them, some of them were already injured.</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Yes, and where did you go to then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> We stopped shooting and went into the bushes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Yes and then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> We waited until it became dark.</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Yes, where did you go to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> We then went to Nkanyiso's house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Was that at the end of this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> We gave Nkanyiso the firearms to hide them for us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> And did you then disperse?</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> Yes, we dispersed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> What did you hope to achieve by attacking this kombi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> There are IFP supporters in Mboyi.  Our shortest route to go to town passed Nkanyezini.  We could no longer, however, use this short route to town because they were shooting at us.  I was once shot at too.  We could no longer go past there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is the name of that place?  What area that you had to go through?</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> Nkanyezini.</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Yes, can you explain to us what you hoped to achieve by attacking this kombi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> Nkanyezini is an ANC stronghold and we people from Mboyi could no longer walk past there.  We could no longer go to town to buy.  We were imprisoned in our area.  Our people would be free to walk after this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> What do you mean by saying that the route, the town was blocked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> Our aim was to avenge.  Secondly, we could no longer walk past Nkanyezini.</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> My question is how come that you could not pass through that area any more?</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> They were shooting at us.  I was also shot in January 1993.  We were blocked from walking there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> How would the attack on this vehicle help you to move through this area again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> Our intention was to kill the people who were attacking the IFP supporters.  This kombi was being used to ferry these people.  It never carried members of the public, as far as we knew.  We did not intend to injure the people who were in the kombi at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Yes, my question is how would the killing of ANC members assist you in being able to go into that area again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> These people in Nkanyezini were attacking us.  This would have opened the way for us, IFP supporters, to walk past there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Yes, but in what way would it help you to kill ANC members to achieve your purpose of being able to use the area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Could I put it the other way around?  After you had completed this attack was the route opened to you again, could you move through Nkanyezini?</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> That has since stopped because people from both areas can now visit each other.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did the shooting take place in that area where you were shot at?</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> It is in the area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> How do you feel about the fact that 10 people died and others were seriously injured as a result of your actions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> I feel very bad.  What I did was wrong and makes me feel bad.  That is why I decided to appear before the Commission, to ask for the relatives of those people to forgive me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Did you personally gain anything?  Did you get money or any gifts for what you did?</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> No, I did not gain anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Is there anything you would like to say to the family members of the victims and the survivors of this attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> Yes.  I sympathise with then for what happened.  I ask then to forgive me because what I did was wrong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR ALBERTS</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> Sorry, I have not said everything that I wanted to say.  Can I proceed?  When I was arrested, I did not say anything about Sepiwe.  I protected him.  To the police, I mentioned the name Sifiso Mkhize, and said he was with me.  I mentioned Sifiso Mkhize because he is the first person I approached when I wanted to attack the kombi.  When I told him that, He refused to be part of us.  I mentioned him because this happened on Friday and we were arrested on Saturday.  I then suspected him giving that information to the police.  That is all what I wanted to clarify.  I did not mention Makhekhe's name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> Sorry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who is this Sepiwe Mkhize?</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> Sifiso.</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sifiso?</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> Yes, Sifiso.</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In the shooting did Zondi take a part as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> Yes, he was present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And he was not charged with you in the criminal trial?</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> He was not charged because I did not mention his name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you give the police the name of Ndlovu as being the person who was with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> Yes.  I told the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Wills?</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR WILLS:</span> I am just testing my mike, the light isn't on. Is it working?  Thank you Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a>	Mr Dladla did I understand you correctly when you indicated that you fired certain shots at the kombi, when it stopped you moved up closer, you continued firing and you then noticed that the people weren't the ANC members that you expected, i.e. the victim and then after that you carried on firing at them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> These people come from the ANC area, although they were not the people we sought.</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Is it on now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a>	You don't seem to understand my question.  I am concerned about what I infer your evidence suggests and that is when you saw the people in the kombi were not the targets that you intended to shoot at you still carried on shooting after that realisation.  That is my question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Why did you do this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> We were shooting them because they were staying in the ANC area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Even though they may be people who were not interested in politics, who may not have been members of the ANC ...[intervention]?</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> I cannot dispute if they say they were not members of the ANC.  However, they were staying in the ANC area and we attacked them in that area.  We went on shooting because we wanted the ANC to feel that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> It seems from your evidence that you must agree with the finding of the trial court in this matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a>	I quote from page 44 of the record Mr Chairperson. </p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a>"He and his companions had absolutely no reason to think or suspect or believe that any of the passengers in this minibus had anything to do with the killing and they clearly did not have any such belief or suspicion."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a>Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Give the gist of it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> I will do Mr Chairperson, thank you. 	Basically the Court found that you realised that the people in the minibus had absolutely nothing to do with the killing of the children, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> That kombi was not used to carry ordinary members of the public, it was used by our attackers.  Those were the people we intended to kill when we attacked this kombi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> In fact it is true that you didn't know who was in that minibus whatsoever did you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> No, I dispute that.  That kombi is used to carry ANC members.  That is why we targeted it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now it didn't carry only ANC, it would carry anybody else too wouldn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> I do not know whether there were ANC or IFP members.  What I say is that we knew this kombi as carrying ANC members.  I agree that these people we killed had nothing to do with death of school children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a>	I put it to you that none of the victims, those people who were either killed or the people who were injured had anything whatsoever to do with the ANC. Can you respond?</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> As I have already explained, this kombi is not known to carry members of the public, it carries ANC members who were killing IFP members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Why did you not investigate more thoroughly or plan your operation more thoroughly to ensure that the people who you killed and injured were the people who you intended to kill and injure?</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> I could not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Just for the record I am going to put my instructions to you and that is that the injured people, the driver of the bus was an individual by the name of Welcome Thembankosi Mkhize. He was the driver. He was non-partisan. David Lembeti or sorry, the deceased Bongili Berta Limbeti was not a member of any political organisation. The deceased Bekiziwe Nxabi was a member of the IFP. And in fact he was even buried by the IFP after this incident. Do you dispute any of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> I cannot dispute it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Do you dispute the fact that Muta Mkhize, his mother Zinzingi Zimu were members of an IFP family, both victims?</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> I cannot dispute it because I do not know them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Do you deny the fact that Bongani Zephaniah Ndlovu was an IFP member from an IFP family?</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> As I explained before, the people in the kombi were not the people we intended.  I therefore cannot dispute that there were IFP members in that kombi too.  What I say is that I knew the kombi to carry ANC supporters and those were the people we intended.</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> What I am putting to you Mr Dladla is the fact of the matter is that a number, more than half of those persons who died ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> Mboyi is an IFP stronghold.  In Nkanyezini, there are ANC supporters, that is why they went to attack school children there.  People in the area were very afraid, as I explained.  I was also shot at in Nkanyezini.  This was going to help us, therefore, not to be attacked by the ANC people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can I just ask you a few questions please? I want you to listen very carefully. There were three of you. You were armed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You could have stopped that vehicle by firing a warning shot. Is that not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> We could not do that because the people using that taxi were always armed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You could have fired a warning shot, the three of you to try to stop ...[indistinct]</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> Our intention was to shoot the people using that kombi.  We did not intend stopping it.  We were going to kill that people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You are now applying for amnesty for having killed some IFP people is that it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> No.  I ask amnesty for killing people I did not intend to.  It has been explained to me that those were not the ANC supporters, the people we intended to kill.</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I put it to you that you were totally reckless because you said in your evidence that even when you saw they were women and you did not intend to kill women you nevertheless proceeded to do so.  How can that conduct be explained?</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> Where we attacked this kombi was in an ANC area.  People staying there belong to the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> This kombi picks up passengers all along the road from all areas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> That kombi is used by ANC people.  Those were the people we wanted.  The driver of that kombi is Qeda, who was involved in killing school children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Let's come back to the question.  When you discovered that there were women in the bus, you had no intention of killing women but you changed your mind and you decided to kill them. Why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> We did this so that the ANC can feel the pain.  Like we did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you didn't think about the pain of innocent passengers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> I felt the pain later, not at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are there any other questions you wish to put to this witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> There are a number.</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes please put them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a>	Do you realise Mr Dladla that one of the conditions of getting amnesty is that you have to fully disclose all the material facts concerning the incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Where did you get your guns from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> We got them from Makhekhe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Where did Makhekhe get the guns from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> I do not know.  They were in one of his huts.  He fetched them and gave them to us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Have you had any military training in use of firearms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> No.  I was never trained.</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Can you tell me then how you were able to use the firearms on the day in question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(inaudible)  That is not relevant.  The fact of the matter is he did and killed people, whether he knew or not how to use it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes, with respect Mr Chairperson, the instructions I have as regard to the issue of full disclosure is that there is in fact a deeper political connection between the supply of weapons and training and linking this individual up.  But if the Committee doesn't want me to pursue that avenue I am perfectly happy to leave.</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes I mean leave it.  He has taken part in the shooting, he tells you he gets a firearm from Makhekhe, he doesn't know where Makhekhe got the guns from.  Unless you are in a position to contradict him, unless you have information to show that he is concealing that fact that he got it from somewhere else, (...indistinct) that is the kind of information then you must put it to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes as you please Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a>	Mr Dladla I put it to you that you were in fact a trained IFP operative in that area and this in fact isn't the first incident you are involved in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> I was never trained.</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Do you know a gentleman by the name of Mr Phillip Powell?</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> Yes.  I know Phillip Powell.</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> How do you know him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> I know him as one of the IFP members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> But how do you know him as a member of IFP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes, thank you Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a>	Have you had any personal dealings with Mr Powell?</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> No, I never met him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Is it true that the second applicant in this matter was in fact a chairperson of the IFP youth in that area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> Which Ndlovu?  I know him as just a member, not that he had any position.</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Were you yourself an active IFP member in the area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> I was just a member.  I did not hold any position.</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Were you at all involved in any of the political violence you referred to in the area as occurring in the area around the time of the incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> No, I was never involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> When you refer to the violence in the area can you tell the Committee what violence the IFP got involved in, in that area around the time of this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> The IFP was being attacked by the ANC members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think the question really tried to elicit an answer did the IFP members ever attack the ANC members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> No there was no attack by the IFP.  If it happens, I did not know about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> If the Committee will just bear with me? I want to go back to the meeting that you had concerning the decision to attack this kombi.   Am I correct in saying that you were the one who took the decision, or you were the one who motivated this action, decided on the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> Yes.  I am the one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And then you got, was it two other cohorts to join you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> So in total there were three of you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> Yes, we were three.</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> And the third person was Sepiwe Zondi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Is Sepiwe Zondi still alive?</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> Sepiwe is deceased.</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Two of the persons who I represent and who were injured in the kombi on that day are reasonably sure that there were 5 people involved in attack on the kombi and they gave this information to the police. Can you comment on that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> We were three.</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> You mentioned that you gave all the weapons to the second applicant after the incident, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> The police in the court indicated that when they came to your house to arrest you that you had indicated to them that you had given one of the weapons to a person by the name of Ntolo, and they actually attended with you to Ntolo's hut and they got that weapon from there. Do you recall that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> I remember that.  The firearm I gave to Mtolo was mine.  It was an AK 47 I picked up.  I then asked Mtolo to keep it for me because he had a licence.  I could not keep it.  I told the police about this and Mtolo gave the firearm to them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Was this weapon used in the attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Why did you have that weapon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> I picked it up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> I didn't ask you how you came to be in possession of that weapon. I asked you why you possessed it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> I grew up in a rural area.  I was looking after cattle when I found it hidden.</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> If you had such an innocent past as you would have this Committee believe on your evidence, why did you not hand this weapon into the police, why did you bother keeping it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> I had been attacked by the ANC members several times.  I kept it to defend myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Did you ever use it for self-protection?</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> I put it to you that you are not being candid with the Committee as regards the way that you and the second applicant came into possession of the firearms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> I am telling the truth.  The firearms were given to us by Makhekhe and we could not ask him where he got the firearms from.</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you nearly finished?</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Yes, just very briefly thank you Mr Chair. Just one last aspect.  Who did you say or who did you think the driver of this kombi was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> Qeda is the driver of that kombi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Does this Keta have any other name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> Yes, he is Jeremiah Zulu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Do you his surname, Jeremiah's surname?</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> Zulu.  Qeda Jeremiah Zulu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Well I put it to you on objective evidence which is accepted by the Court, that the person actually driving the kombi that day, and that person is present in this room today, was an individual by the name of Welcome Themba Ngoso Mkhize, and further that he has never been known by any of the names you have mentioned today.</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> Yes.  The kombi was not driven by Qeda on that day, it was driven by its owner.  Qeda is the regular driver because the owner is employed somewhere.</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> Are you saying that on the day of the incident, that this person Keta was not driving the kombi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a>	Yes sorry I didn't - so you further saying that even though you realised that, you still attacked the kombi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> Yes, we continued.</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR WILLS</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you have questions that you wish to put to this witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> No, thank you Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Any re-examination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">RE-EXAMINATION BY MR ALBERTS:</span> Yes Mr Chairman, just a few aspects on the point that my learned friend has just touched on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a>	At what stage during this attack did you realise that the people in the kombi are not the people that you expected to find in the kombi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> This a dusty road.  There was dust when it approaches and drove past us.  It was only after the dust had subsided that we realised that the people that we were shooting at were not the people we intended.</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Was it before or after the kombi stopped?</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> It was after it had stopped.</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> As far as the information you had was concerned, was this kombi usually used as a taxi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> It is not used by the public.</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> According to your information what was this kombi used as?</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> It was used by ANC supporters to attack IFP supporters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> And who did you expect to find inside that vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MR DLADLA:</span> We expected the people who were attackers of the IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman nothing further.</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR ALBERTS</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Wills, is Mr Welcome Mkhize here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> He is indeed Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And is he available to give evidence? I would like a few questions to put to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">MR WILLS:</span> I am sure he wouldn't mind. I haven't broached him on the subject but he is here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You are excused.  Excuse me, yes you are excused you can go off please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mkhize, are you here?  Mr Mkhize I am sorry, you did not know that you were going to give evidence but I personally would like to clear up one or two questions about this vehicle.  Are you prepared to answer questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">WELCOME MKHIZE:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Your name has been mentioned as the driver of this kombi on the day when it was attacked by the applicant and his companions. Were you in fact the driver?</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, I was the driver on that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who is the owner of this kombi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I am the owner.</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you at that time when this incident occurred - were you at that time the owner?</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now what was the purpose for which this kombi was used?</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> It was a taxi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You say it was a regular taxi used like other taxis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And where did you operate from and to what destination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I was operating from Pietermaritzburg town to Nkanyezini area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And how many trips a day did you make?</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> It depended on how many passengers I got.</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Would there be a time when it would make more than one trip a day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, about four trips a day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Would you pick up passengers along the way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You heard the evidence of the last witness who says that you operated from an ANC area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> It was not true that the areas were divided as IFP or ANC areas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> To your knowledge did your vehicle only convey ANC passengers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No.	  It was ferrying all passengers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The man Mthethwa whose name has been mentioned here, was he your regular driver?</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> That is a lie.  Qeda never drove my car.  I was always driving it whenever my driver was not there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You know the man Mthethwa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes, I know him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> On the day of this incident were you one of those who were injured?</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> By the grace of Jesus, I was not injured.</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Alberts are there any questions you wish to put to this person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR ALBERTS:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a>	How do you know this person Mthethwa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I knew Qeda as one of the home boys, like and other boy in the area.  When the violence started, I left and went to stay in town because I could afford.  I left them in the area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just come forward and talk into the mike.</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Sit up straight.</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I cannot remember.  I was already in the suburb when the violence started.</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Did you still work in this area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I ran a taxi business.</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> When was it that you moved to the suburbs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Long ago, before many people started dying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> And what type of, you said you had a job, what job did you do in the suburbs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I was a manager for Rainbow Chicken.</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> So during the day time you could not operate your taxi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I was driving it when I am off.</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> And on the days that you were working, did that taxi just stand there at home?</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Thulani Zimu was using it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> If I am not mistaken your evidence earlier was that you were the driver of that vehicle at all times, nobody else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Let me explain that I am working at Rainbow Chicken.  When I was off, I would drive it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is the name of the person who drove it whilst you were at work, Thulani what?   Thulani what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Thulani Zimu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, do carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> My question was if I remember correctly, when Mr Chairman asked you a question regarding who the driver of that taxi was, you said only you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I meant when I was not working I used to drive it.  When not, Thulani would drive it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> The question was put to you whether this Mthethwa ever drove the vehicle and you said: "Oh no" only you are the driver.  Are you changing your evidence now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> That is a mistake.</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Did this Mthethwa also drive the car from time to time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> It never happened even once that Qeda drove my vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> If you say when you moved to the suburbs you forgot about the area but you also say every weekend or on your off days you drove the vehicle there and back as a taxi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is the question? I didn't hear the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> The witness stated earlier in his evidence that when he moved to the suburbs I think his words were he put that area behind him, giving the impression that he had nothing further to do with the area but now he says on his off days he is a taxi driver and he drives on that route on all his off days.</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Because of the violence in that area he left ...(inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I do not understand the question because on that day I was on the road the whole day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> You only left after this - I'm sorry, you left before this incident of the shooting, you left the area and went to live in the suburbs, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> I just want to confirm; your earlier evidence was you only left to go and live in the suburbs some time after this incident where your vehicle was ...(intervention)</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, he said: "But when the violence started I moved away to the suburbs."  Now: "When the violence started" might mean the general violence in that area it might mean this incident.  Now I think that if you want to clear that up what you might ask really is; did you move, were you living in the suburbs at the time of this incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> At the time of this incident where your vehicle was attacked, were you living in the suburbs by then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Let me explain that my mother was still staying in the area and I was running a business.  I did not forget that there were people staying there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ja.</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> And you also said that when you moved to the suburbs you put the area behind you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What about the area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> ...(no English translation)</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> This taxi route that you take does it go into that area?  Just maybe to clear that up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No.  It was not reaching the area where people liked to attack each other.</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Isn't that where you were attacked, in the area where you were staying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But I think that really you want to know on that day if it is clear that he was the driver and Nxedi, isn't that the end of the matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Yes, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  He says that on that day he was lucky he got out alive and wasn't killed, so he was the driver.</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Yes Mr Chairman, I am just trying to establish on other days as well.  That is also relevant. What is your relationship with this Mthethwa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I was not related to Qeda.  We just grew up together, even with the applicants here.  I then moved to the suburb and left them there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, nothing further.</p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR ALBERTS</p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Brink are there any questions you wish to put?</p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> No, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a>NO QUESTIONS BY MR BRINK</p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You have ...(inaudible) to say yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I just want this one question to be, for the sake of my peace of mind answered finally, how would you know that Mthethwa never drove your vehicle or have never driven your vehicle if it was in the control of another driver?</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> If I am at work, I would not know what happens to my vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Was the other driver a permanent driver, this Thulani Zimu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Would any one from time to time stand in for him, drive on his behalf?</p>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> It would happen that Ndaba Cebekhulu drive my car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Could Mthethwa have driven the taxi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I cannot say, but as far as I know, he never drove it.  But one cannot know what the drivers do when one is at work.</p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you have any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Just one.  Mr Mkhize you said you moved to the suburbs because there was violence.  In which areas was there violence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I was born in Mboyi.  Violence then started and people left the area.  I then moved to the suburbs for safety of my children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Now within this area when you say violence was it gangster related or was it organisation against organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I did not know what was happening because one would just wake up in the morning and find a person dead.  When you ask who killed that person, there would be no answer.  I then realised that I might also be a victim and the best thing for me was to leave the area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> In respect of political organisations, that is the IFP and ANC do you bear knowledge of which organisation was dominant in the Ziboya area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> It was the IFP in Mboyi at that time.  One cannot say the killings were done by the IFP or the ANC, but it is still going on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> How long after the violence had taken place in that area did you move out to the suburbs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I stayed there for some time, and when I saw that the killings were going on, I decided to leave.</p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Now I am asking you an opinion here, if you can't answer this please say so.   Whilst you were living in the area was there talk that the ANC and perhaps the IFP were attacking each other?  Did you ever hear something of that nature?</p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes.  That happened but eventually I left because people were killed mysteriously.</p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I don't think that really the purpose of that question is that.  I think the purpose of the question is to find out from you whether it was well-known that in that area there was on-going conflict between the ANC and the IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> There were political differences and people started killing each other.</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, my question was that it is well-known in that area that there was this conflict.</p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> It was well known yes, because other people had left the area and were staying in tents in Pietermaritzburg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Does that answer your question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> ...(inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Can I just follow up on that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes certainly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr Mkhize do you support a political organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> At the time of the incident were you a supporter of the one or the other organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> This Mr Thulani Zimu do you know him well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I will not say I know him that well because I am married and have children and Thulani does not have children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Mr Mkhize did you vote during the last elections in April 1994? Did you vote for any political party?</p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Which party did you vote for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Do you know whether Mr Zimu voted and where he voted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> I do not know because he is a bachelor and I am married.</p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Very well, thank you very much.  You are excused from further attendance.  Thanks for coming and volunteering to give evidence when requested to do so. ...(indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a><span class="speaker">MR MKHIZE:</span> Thank you, too.</p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a>WITNESS IS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Brink isn't it a convenient stage to take the adjournment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman it is.  I don't know, possibly my colleague could give an indication how long he proposes being with the second application in this matter because?</p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  I am prepared to carry on but I want to take into account the people that operate, the interpreters, the people that operate this equipment and so on.  They may have transport problems.</p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> I understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRINK:</span> Possibly if we can adjourn just for a few minutes then I can ascertain whether after the break they are prepared to carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Very well I will stand down for a little while.</p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...(indistinct) of carrying on until a little later this afternoon but the prospect of finishing the evidence of a witness between now and 5 o'clock is remote and therefore we have decided that we are now going to adjourn and we will resume promptly at 9 o'clock tomorrow morning.  I trust that counsel will make themselves available in time with their witnesses and everybody else so that we can promptly begin at 9 o'clock tomorrow morning.  Will that be convenient to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a><span class="speaker">MR ALBERTS:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And Mr Wills?</p>
