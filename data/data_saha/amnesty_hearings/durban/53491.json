Nobody escorts them, they just leave.  At that stage, a decision is taken to fetch Dudu, people go down to Dudu's place, back up the hill, there is again a tribunal, a decision that she be lashed 200 cuts, there is a long queue, then Dudu goes back and she is ordered out of the area, then the kombi arrives.  Now really some time must have lapsed by now and you are telling me that all the people are still in Amos Cele's house?  I find it very difficult to understand, especially also because those pursued were only Dudu and Bonny, that we have direct evidence of, people involved in the pursuit.

On that evening, it was already dark, I heard people approaching my home.  I assumed that they must be comrades because we were at that time patrolling the area because of the situation.   Before I could communicate or contact these people, I heard gunshots.  I was standing, leaning against a big tree. When I heard these gunshots I returned fire, because I had a firearm in my possession.  Immediately thereafter comrades from the area came, wanting to know what was going on.   When they enquired I informed them that there were people who had just fired shots at me and they were chased.  As explained before, it was dark, we chased  after these people and managed to get hold of just one of them.  Myself and Bongani then shot this person and thereafter we dispersed.  On the following day, it was discovered that Amos Cele had been amongst that group of people.  In fact it was Amos Cele who had been shot.",
