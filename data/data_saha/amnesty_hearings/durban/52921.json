The actual return of service is being faxed to us from the Pinetown office this morning.\n\tMr Chairman, may I place on record that in respect of Mr Lubuza, one of the next of kin, the address that he gave:\n601 Demat, Marion Hill\nThe owner of the property was contacted, in fact was visited and he doesn't know Mr Lubuzo.  There is no further address for Mr Lubuzo.  There were two implicated persons, one, Mr Themba Mthethwa and one, Mr Fezekile Mabida.  Unfortunately their addresses were given as:\nBottlebrush Shack Settlement\nUnfortunately, Mr Chairman, no better address could be found and no-one knew them at that settlement.  The events occurred almost five years ago.  \n\tSo I do have those notices with me.  Other than that we are ready to proceed.
