Before we commence with the application of Mr Mbanjwa and Mr Ndaba, we would like to get an explanation from Ms Thabethe why this Committee has been kept waiting while she was consulting in the presence of the Committee when it was already in sitting because the request that was acceded to by the Chair of this Committee was to enable her to consult whilst Mr Wills was on his way to this venue.  Can she advance any reason why she continued to consult, notwithstanding the fact that the Committee had already taken its seat to commence with these proceedings?",

Maybe there was a misunderstanding between myself and the Madam Chair, I was not aware that it was in as far as until Mr John Wills arrives.  I though that I would consult with them and come back to the Committee Members.\n\tSecondly, Madam Chair, I was facing the other direction, I did not see until Mr Joe Japhta came to me, that the Committee Members had come into the hall, because I was facing the other direction, talking to the victims.  So I apologise, otherwise I would have come forward and explained.",
