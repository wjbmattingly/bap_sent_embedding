            "Yes.   I was born on the 24th of September 1944. I was raised in an Afrikaans Christian home. When I was four years old, the National Party Government came to power, and I grew up under a National Party Government which looked after White interests in the country or the Boer nation's interests. For a long period after the Anglo Boer War, there was a lot of discrimination against the Boers. If you spoke your own language you were discriminated against. We were humiliated.\nThe Afrikaner, or the Boer could not obtain good positions of employment and as a result of the policy which was followed by the British in those years and also Louis Botha and the Jan Smuts Government, my grandfather who fought in the Anglo-Boer War came to the realisation that if you cannot speak both languages that you would not be able to obtain any significant post. As a result of this, my grandfather sent his children, namely my father and his brothers and sisters, they were sent to English schools for their academic education in a foreign language, in other words, not their mother tongue, and that meant that I was also sent to an English school. \nAnd as I grew up I realised that it was not right that I was forced to speak a different language to my home language to be able to become something in this world, and for that reason I was very proud of the National Party Government who espoused the cause of the Boer Nation. \nIn my years in an English school I had to endure lots of taunting, for instance when people called me a hairy-back and a rock-spider. That just strengthened my Boer pride. In the early 1980's I realised that the then National Party Government were following a policy with which I couldn't associate myself.\nWhen the CP was founded in 1982 I became a supporter of the Conservative Party. I could identify with the ideals and policy of this party. In the 1983 referendum, when the issue to be voted on was whether there should be a change in the then political dispensation, I voted against it. I was not in favour of the change. I could see that the Boer in his own country would be alienated once again, and that everything which he had thus far brought about and established would be taken away from him. Everything which the Boer nation has established and achieved in the history of this country it achieved through struggle and humiliation, oppression and suffering. \nFor that reason I aligned myself very firmly with the Conservative Party and I supported it. In 1987 elections I voted for the CP, and that was the first election that the CP took part in and they were so well supported that they became the official opposition in Parliament. In this period I also became a member of the AWB - Afrikaner Weerstands Beweging because I felt that this movement supported the ideals of the Boer nation, and wanted to protect us. All that we asked was that which any nation asks, namely to govern itself in its own territory.\nDuring that time there were independent Black states, namely Transkei, Venda, Bophuthatswana and so on, and we did not begrudge any nation the right to govern itself in its own sovereign] territory. We did not claim for ourselves anything which we did not allow any other nation. We believed that whether Zulu, Boer or Xhosa, that you have the right to live amongst your own people in your own territory and to govern yourself.  And that is what the AWB requested from the then National Party Government but our requests were regarded with contempt. Although I was a member of the AWB at that stage, I was not an active member and with the election of 6 September 1989 election, in the period before this election, I started working for the Conservative Party. We put up posters, we registered voters, we canvassed and I became known to the Conservative Party and eventually I was elected as the chairperson of the management of the Conservative Party, that is the Empangeni branch for the Umfolozi constituency.\nI devoted myself to the task at hand and I worked very hard . I was so intensely involved with the election campaign that I endured a lot of stress to the point where I actually suffered a heart-attack, and in 1990 I had to undergo a heart by-pass operation. The result of that election is now history today, and I realised that the political dispensation in this country had changed irrevocably; that the political dispensation as we had known it was something of the past, it was gone forever. I realised that the Boer nation would have to enter the fray again, to enter the struggle to regain that which had been taken away from it, namely our freedom and the right to govern ourselves in our own territory.\nFor that reason I contacted Mr Eugene Terreblanche, the leader of the AWB and we had a political meeting in Richards Bay, and due to the fact that I was very well known in right-wing circles in the Umfolozi area, I within a very short period of time, gained and recruited a whole group of new members for the AWB. At that stage the so-called Wenkommando of the AWB had not yet been established, but once it had been established, I got together a group, a commando group, and we started training them.  Mr Eugene Terreblanche appointed me as Kommandant of the AWB in the Northern Zululand region. Whilst I served in the AWB I was also elected to deputy-chairperson of the financial Committee of the AWB, and in this capacity, I attended various meetings throughout the Free State and the Transvaal. \nAt one such meeting I was approached by members of the Orde Boerevolk.  They wanted to recruit me to establish a cell of this Orde Boerevolk in Richards Bay. They explained to me what the motives and objectives of this cell would be, and I could identify with these objectives because they believed in what I believed in. I identified with their objectives because my beliefs were the same as their beliefs, namely that we would have to struggle to regain that which had been taken away from us. I had to swear an oath. They told me that if I could not identify myself with any particular item in this oath I should tell them that and then that meeting would be regarded as never having taken place and not be held against me and I could just leave.\n\tI read through the oath and I agreed with each and every point contained in the oath. I took the oath and they then told me, and I indeed believed it at the time, that there was already a civil war existing in South Africa although it might have been a very low intensity civil war, but the violence was present",

And I must also mention that at that stage, the violence, or the civil war which reigned in the country at the time - it was mainly Black on Black violence. The Orde said that this violence would spread and that it would ultimately change to Black on White violence, and that it was only a matter of time before that happened. Especially the PAC, the PAC was very militant and they had various slogans like \"one settler, one bullet\".\nWe prepared ourselves for an onslaught against our people, and on the morning of the 9th of October 1980, I heard on SABC news that a group of about 30 Black people clad in PAC T-shirts had attacked Whites on the Durban beachfront using knives, and that various people had been wounded and taken to hospital and that an elderly man had died as a result of the wounds so sustained.\nI was convinced that the PAC had started implementing its campaign of  terror against White people, and - I'm sorry, I thought you wanted to ask a question.",

I was under the impression that the campaign of terror by the PAC against Whites had now commenced, and since we had already declared war against the National Party, and as a result of this attack, I as cell leader felt that we should launch a counter-attack to prove to the government of the day, and to show to it that the road it was following was full of danger and that incidents of this kind would increase in frequency.\nOur purpose was also to show to the PAC and its communist allies that attacks of this kind would not be tolerated, and that we would take counter-measures in a very forceful way.\nAnd I also felt that the counter-attack should take place in Durban where the attack from the PAC had taken place in the morning and I felt that the attack by the PAC and the counter-attack should be seen in context, and I think we succeeded in this, because in the Sunday Tribune of the 14th of October 1990 in which interviews had been conducted with passengers in a bus from where the attack was launched, it said that they believed that the attack had been launched by Boers as a result of the PAC attack that morning on White people at the beach front.\nWe travelled by car from Richards Bay to Durban and it was late in the evening when we arrived here, it was about, I think about eight o'clock or nine o'clock maybe when we arrived here.",

            "When I refer to \"we\", when I heard of the attack, I immediately contacted Adriaan Smuts and Mr Eugene Marais and asked them whether they had heard about the attack. I must say that both Mr Adriaan Smuts and Mr Eugene Marais were members of my cell, the cell that I had established, a cell of the Orde Boerevolk. I could not immediately get hold of Mr Smuts, but I spoke to Mr Marais about it and he also felt that if this attack should just be allowed to take place and nothing be done about it without any counter-attack that we would not succeed in our objective of making people realise that this kind of attack would not be tolerated in future, or be allowed to happen with impunity.\nI told Mr Marais to come to my home that evening, and at about six o'clock that evening I contacted Mr Smuts by telephone and I also ordered him to come to my home. We there decided  to travel to Durban by car and to launch a counter-attack, so that we could show the government and the PAC that the conduct by the PAC, the ANC and their communist allies and also the government's policy that this would not be tolerated without any conduct by the Orde Boerevolk. \nWhen we arrived in Durban, we drove in the vicinity of the bus ranks, but the area was very - quite quiet. The next day was the 10th of October, which would be a public holiday, Kruger Day, and perhaps that contributed to the fact that the streets of Durban were fairly quiet. We saw a minibus taxi driving past us, it was full of passengers, and we decided that we would attack this minibus. \nWe followed the bus from the central area of Durban and the bus moved in - along the freeway in the direction of KwaMashu.   The bus turned off the freeway and entered a very densely populated area, and as a result of this, I aborted the attack. \nWe then returned to the freeway and at the Evoko off-ramp we turned off there and turned back towards Durban. Because it was quite late at that stage, and it was very quiet, we considered perhaps returning to Richard's Bay.   We stopped at a garage and we bought some coldrinks and drank these coldrinks. Whilst we were busy doing that, a Putco bus full of people drove past from Durban in the direction of KwaMashu. \n\tI decided that we would attack this bus and gave the instruction. We then followed the bus in our car, and near the Duff Road off-ramp, I was driving the car, I should say that, and Mr Adriaan Smuts sat in the back of the car on the left-hand side, and Mr Eugene Marais was sitting in the passenger seat.\nWe overtook the bus and I told my colleagues to fire in the direction of the bus. We used automatic attack rifles to fire at the bus as we passed the bus - as we overtook it.  Immediately after the attack we returned to Richards Bay. \nThe following day, that is the 10th of October, the very next day, I contacted the news office of the SABC and told them that I was a member of the Orde Boerevolk and that the Orde Boerevolk accepted responsibility for the attack the previous night on the Putco bus. \nI don't know whether the person I spoke to took me seriously, but he was fooling around and asked me to furnish my name and address. I then put down the phone  and then contacted the news office of the Natal Mercury.  I spoke to somebody in the news office there.   I told them that I was a member of the Orde Boerevolk and that we accepted responsibility for the previous night's attack and I also furnished the reasons why we launched the attack. There was no report in any of the papers the next day regarding this incident and I realised that there was a state of emergency at the time in Natal and I  suspected that either the security police of the government or both had probably suppressed news of this kind.\nI once again contacted the Natal Mercury offices, spoke to the same reporter and told him that I was aware of the fact that news of this kind would normally be suppressed by the government and I threatened that unless the news was published and unless they mentioned that the attack had been launched by the Orde Boerevolk and mentioned our reasons for doing so, unless this was published, I would launch a similar attack.\nI later learned that at the time of the second call to the Natal Mercury , the security police were actually in the office and had spoken to the reporter during my phone call. \n\tOn the 17th of October 1990, I, Mr Smuts and Mr Marais were arrested by the police. We were detained in terms of Section 29 of the Internal Security Act whilst the case against us was being investigated. After that we appeared in court where we were charged with murder, attempted murder and illegal possession of fire-arms.",

I was notified that a meeting would take place of the Financial Committee of the AWB and that I should attend this meeting.\n\tI went to the training camp premises and there, as I said, I was recruited by the Orde Boerevolk. When I arrived at the camp, I don't think I knew even five people present there, and I think there must have been about between - this past weekend there was a training camp and of the four hundred, five hundred people present I only knew about five people.\nI drove there all the way from Richards Bay so it was round about lunch time when the Financial Committee - the Financial Committee meeting hadn't yet taken place then, and I started becoming impatient because I had to return to Richards Bay on the same day. \n\tAn unknown person came to me and asked me whether I was Kommandant Piet Botha from Richards Bay, and I answered in the affirmative. He then took me into a building and said I had to walk down the passage and enter the second door on the right as there were people there who wanted to see me. I walked down the passage. I thought that maybe this was the start of the meeting. When I got to the door, the door was closed. I knocked, but it was locked.\nThe question was asked \"Who are you?\" and I told them. They asked me to wait for a moment. The door was opened and I entered. Two people were sitting inside the room dressed in khaki clothes, not in the uniform of the AWB, they simply wore khaki clothes without any insignia. Both of these persons wore Balaclavas, and when I entered the room they locked the door behind me, and then they told me that they were members of the Orde Boerevolk and that they had been watching me for quite a considerable time, and that they wanted to appoint me as a member of the Orde Boerevolk.  They wanted me to establish a cell of the Orde Boerevolk in Richards Bay.\nAs I said earlier in my evidence, they then explained all the objectives of the Orde Boerevolk to me. They showed me this oath form and asked me whether I agreed with each point in the statement and whether I was prepared to take the oath. I read it through and said \"yes\" I told them that I identified with the objectives and I then took the oath. But who these persons were, I don't know.\nWhether I had seen them before I could not tell you because I could not identify them as a result of the fact that they were wearing Balaclavas. We also discussed ways of communicating with each other. For instance, code names, telephone numbers etc. I could contact them and they would be able to contact me.\nThey also said that they were not interested in who I would recruit as members of my cell. They operated, as the English say \"on a need to know basis\". You only know what you really need to know. That which you don't need to know about you don't ask questions about.

The other two members recruited by myself were prepared to take the oath, but once again because there were no witnesses present, I could not actually administer the oath to them, so up until this day they have never actually signed the oath.",

That only happened on the evening of the 9th of October, that's when he swore the oath.  And on the evening of the 9th, Mr Smuts filled in this form and also took the oath and myself and Mr Marais then signed as witnesses. Mr Smuts did not take the oath on the 24th or filled in the document before the 9th of October although Mr Marais did do that.",
