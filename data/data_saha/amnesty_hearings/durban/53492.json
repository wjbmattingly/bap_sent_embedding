His muscles were out.\n\tI told Bongani to run away and he said to me he couldn't run away because he was injured and I said to him he must try.  I got inside the house as I looked for the children.

I told Nana not to go because she was going to meet them, but she insisted and then she left.\n\tI went to various houses there at home.  I went also inside Bonny's house.

She was shouting, telling them to hurry up and to burn the houses quicker and faster and she also said that after that they should come to the sugar cane field because there were people hiding in the sugar cane filed.  That's when I told my brother that we should leave the sugar cane field, because also the smoke was getting heavier.  We started running away towards the Khanu's place.  \n\tBongumusa Roy Cele shouted.  I could hear his voice because he is my brother, he's my father's son.  And he said \"there's the bitch from the family\" and he said that I was trying to hide from the banana field.  And it was true, I ran towards the direction of the banana field.

            "Thank you, Chairperson.\n\tThis structure, which was not formally elected I would admit, but it had the motive of fighting crime - as the Honourable Chair has already stated, in the area.  Coming to the issue of the actual offences, or the actual acts by Thulani Cele.  Thulani Cele is applying for amnesty for the public violence and in terms of the Act, the Promotion of National Unity Act, and Reconciliation Act, Mr Thulani Cele has made a full disclosure of his participation in the acts of public violence of Manyasene.\n\tHe admitted that he administered strokes on the victims, as it is mentioned in the bundle, and Mr Thulani Cele further admitted, or made full disclosure to the killing of Dudu Ngcobo.  He even mentioned that he used - according to the indictment and judgment, it was said that a big stone was thrown on Dudu, and this disclosure was made by the applicant.\n\tTherefore, in terms of Section 20 of the Act, the act, or the acts which were committed by Thulani Cele, was having a political objective.  The political objective of this act emanates from the fact that a structure under the ANC, which is a publicly political organisation, was fighting crime in the area of Manyasene, and it was decided by the community of Manyasene, which was mostly ANC, that any person found in the area committing crime or disturbing the peace which was already in existence in the area, that person will be punished.  Those were the grounds on which the applicant, Mr Thulani Cele, performed the acts of public violence.\n\tIn terms of Section 2(a), this Thulani Cele, a member of a publicly known organisation, was performing the acts not towards a person whom he knew - for instance in the case of Dudu he admitted that he didn't know Dudu as a member of any political opposition party, but I believe that the Act is not only limited to a fact where a person has to be a member of an opposition political party.\n\tAn act which has been committed under, or with a political motive, with a political objective, as Mr Thulani Cele's structure, believed that whatever they were doing, they were doing it under political objectives.  \n\tTherefore, I will submit that Mr Thulani Cele be granted amnesty on these grounds because all the acts that he performed were for the political organisation to which he belonged and ...(intervention)",

He did not speak about any comrades, or he did not suggest that maybe he had gone to report the matter to the ANC and maybe ANC members were sent to help him guard the house, he talks about the fact that he called his friends to help him to guard the house, which suggests that this was indeed a personal issue rather than a political issue.  \n\tWith regard, Madam Chair, to - before I come to Roy Cele, Madam Chair, my prayer therefore with regard to Thulani Cele's application, is that his amnesty be refused, on the basis of what I've just argued.\n\tWith regard to the application of Roy Cele, Madam Chair, I would like to oppose, or I would like to argue that amnesty not be granted on the following basis.\n\tWith regard to the offence of the assault on Dudu Ngcobo, he was also asked as to the reasons why he had assaulted Dudu Ngcobo, and like the applicant he said because she had invited people into the area, who had come to disturb peace in the area.  I don't find, with due respect, anything political about that, more especially taking into consideration the reason why these people came into the area.  \n\tThey had come into the area because their brother had died and upon discovering that his hand and his arm were not there, they came into the area to find out what had happened to the other body parts, which I think is quite normal and it should be expected from a member of a family who is concerned.\n\tSecondly, Madam Chair, I would argue that there was - with regard to the killing of Amos Cele, which is the second offence that Roy Cele has applied for, I would argue that the Committee accepts the victims' version of how Amos Cele was killed, as opposed to the version of Roy Cele.

The purpose of establishing this informal structure, from the evidence led before us, was to curb crime, crime which was taking place at Manyasene only, crime which was merely perpetuated by criminals, crime which was not committed by people who were undermining the ANC.\n\tThese were acts of criminals and they were not aimed at the ANC, as a community of Manyasene.  These were criminal acts aimed at the community at large.  As such an informal structure was formed.  \n\tWe are quite familiar with the fact that the ANC Youth League and other ANC structures bearing the name ANC, came up in reaction to some of the criminal activities which became prevalent in different areas.  In this case there was no ANC formation, this was an informal structure.  I don't know how I'm supposed to really emphasise my comprehension of this particular aspect of evidence.",

Accused number 1 also says that the deceased was an Inkatha supporter.  Although the children of the deceased deny this, the evidence of Ngcobo and Zulu(?) certainly shows that the killing was an ANC killing.
