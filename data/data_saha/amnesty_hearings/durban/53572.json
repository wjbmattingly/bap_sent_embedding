One of the persons who lay with me in the line, his safety catch of his firearm was not off and as the person approached the vehicle in front of us, I cannot say who the person was, I am not certain, he pulled his safety catch back and this made a rather loud noise and it appeared to me as if the person on the other side of the vehicle stopped and listened in our direction, as if he wasn't certain of what he had heard.
