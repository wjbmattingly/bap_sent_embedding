<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a><span class="speaker">JAN B DE WET:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Mr Chairman, just before we continue, Mr Bracher was detained and indicated that he would be attending a bit later.  He asked me to convey that to the Committee.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Mr De Wet, your application for amnesty is contained in Volume 1, from page 66 to 80 and Annexure B, page 214 to 223.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can I just interrupt you, won't you turn those things down please.  It is echoing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Mr De Wet, in your application form on page 70, you mention the offences for which you were found guilty, and there you mentioned that you were found guilty of the explosions in Bree Street and at Jan Smuts?</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> As well as the pipe bombs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And according to the judgment, that is not correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No, that is not correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> You were only found guilty for the Germiston attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct.  I would just like the Committee to amend that for me please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> But Mr de Wet you are applying for amnesty for all the explosions before 1994?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> In your application form you mentioned that you are a member of the AWB and also a member of the Ystergarde?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> What was your position in the Ystergarde?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> In the Ystergarde I was a Captain and I was also an Instructor, as well as a personal bodyguard of Mr Terreblanche who is the leader of the AWB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Did you attend any meetings which Mr Terreblanche addressed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Most of the meetings Mr Terreblanche addressed in the Western Transvaal, I was present there because of the fact that I was a bodyguard and I had to accompany him to his meetings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Now the time right before the election, what was the message that Mr Terreblanche, on behalf of the AWB, conveyed to the country?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> In the run up to the election it was quite evident that the ANC would take over the country and that the government would give it to the ANC, and at the meetings he said that there would be no negotiations, the only negotiation would take place through the barrel of a gun.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a>	At several meetings Mr Terreblanche said about the explosions and said that it would be bigger explosions, bigger bombs and I accepted that the struggle and the revolution against the ANC and the NP would be with fire weapons and with bombs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do I understand you correctly Mr De Wet, that you testified to what Mr Terreblanche said - are you telling the Committee that what you did, you did because you were influenced by what Mr Terreblanche said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Otherwise you wouldn't have done it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No, I wouldn't have done it otherwise.</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> During February 1994, you also attended a meeting at Lichtenburg, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> What was the message which Terreblanche conveyed there at Lichtenburg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> After we got the freedom of the town, Mr Terreblanche as well as Constand Viljoen as well as other members of the  right-wing, they addressed a meeting and Terreblanche said there that the ANC, there would be no negotiations with the ANC and the bombs which already exploded, after that, there would be bigger explosions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Do you carry any knowledge with regards to a report which appeared in the Rapport paper and I ask the permission Mr Chairperson, to submit a report which appeared on the 6th of February 1994 in the Rapport and this I received from the Institute of Own Time History and I would just like to submit it if you will allow me.  I hope I am correct Chairperson, I think it is Exhibit G.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, that would be Exhibit F.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> In the report which you have in front of you, is it the speech that you referred to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And in this report, it is where Mr Terreblanche said that if the demands are not met, let there be more bombs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> You already made mention of the freedom of several towns which the AWB received and that is also stated in your amnesty application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Then there were call up instructions in April 1994, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Did you also receive call up instructions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, I did.  But the day they got together at the Trim Park, I was not able to go because of financial problems, and I could not be there.  Brigadier Leon van der Merwe was called by me and I told him that I would come later to Ventersdorp, and he said it was fine, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And then you went to Ventersdorp?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, I did go there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When did you go to Ventersdorp?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> It was the 20th or the 21st of April Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> When you arrived in Ventersdorp, where were the people gathered at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> At that stage I did not know where the people were gathered.  I went to Brigadier Leon van der Merwe who was the Head of the Ystergarde, I went to his house and when I arrived there, I found him, Johan Smit, Jaco Nel who is also an applicant, Tiaan Potgieter, who was also a co-accused, I found them there and the next instructions were then given to me by Leon van der Merwe and Johan Smit and the instructions were that it was war and we needed a safe place for the women and children and I told them that the place where I was at that stage, was quite safe and there were also other alternative safety places and he said, send people out with me to go and have a look at the places and in the morning, there we left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who told you that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Brigadier Leon van der Merwe and Johan Smit.  He was a Major in the Ystergarde.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I just want to confirm, did he say the war is on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, he said the war is beginning and the AWB's Wenkommando is busy to occupy the whole of the Western Transvaal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And that was about on the 20th?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> It was the 20th or the 21st, I am not quite sure about the date Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why did you go to Ventersdorp?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Because I received call up instructions which said that the AWB and his Wenkommando and the Ystergade was called up to the Western Transvaal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was that the only reason?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No, with the run up to the election, because we suspected that there would be complete chaos with the elections, and we, the  right-wingers, made ourselves ready for a revolution.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do I understand you correctly that the reason why you went to Ventersdorp, was to prepare yourself in Ventersdorp and to help to interrupt, interfere with the election?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Any other reason?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Later, I will give evidence, but later I also received further instructions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> You mentioned that you were not at the gathering at the Trim Park, or at the meeting there, and Leon van der Merwe informed you about what he said to the people there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct Chairperson, I was told when I was at his house, that we were going to gather together, the women would move together and there would be several commando's.  I am talking about the AWB Wenkommando.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a>	They would gather in different places in the Western Transvaal in order to secure our people and also to disrupt the elections and to make sure it does not happen.  After a while, he also told me that at the game farm, where we would be gathered, we would receive further instructions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Did you know if there were any other commando's that gathered together except for those in Ventersdorp?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes Chairperson, as I remember correctly, there were seven areas in the Western Transvaal and there were between 200 and 400 families gathered at specific places.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Did you know which instructions those commando's had?</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> I did not know which instructions were given to them Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> The women and children, they went to your farm in Ottosdal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Where did the men go?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> After the women and the children and the people from Ventersdorp, after they arrived there - I am talking about the Ystergarde, we were called together and Johan Smit and Abe Fourie told us that we would move from there to another place.  I knew where this place was, but some of the other people did not know that we were go to the game farm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a>	From there, after we sorted out the vehicles, we left some of the vehicles for the women and we took vehicles for ourselves and from there, we went to Ventersdorp.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Can we just determine a day Mr De Wet, because there are sometimes problems with dates.  When did you go to the game farm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> It was Friday, the 22nd.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> That is the Friday before the election?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct, the 22nd.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> At the game farm, did you have any obligations or tasks?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> We arrived there quite late the Friday evening, it was more early morning Saturday.  Most of us went to bed.  There were some people who did guard duties, they were already there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a>	The next morning Johan Smit and Abe Fourie called us together and we were told that the purpose why we were there, was to protect this area, to do patrols and to do guard duties.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> The Saturday night, that is the 23rd, there was a meeting held for some of the members there at the game farm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Were you involve?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> I was involved at the meeting.  Commandant Dupie was there as well as Jannie Kruger, who was a Lieutenant in the Garde.  He stood at a chalk board, a black board, and there were certain sketches on this board.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a>	The purpose of this meeting was to go and steal vehicles.  We were told about where the garages are where the vehicles were and we were told to do certain things.  Jannie and Dupie told us about the area, the environment, we didn't know it well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a>	Jannie Kruger came from Klerksdorp and the area in Klerksdorp where the vehicles were, he explained this to us, this area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> What were you supposed to do with these vehicles?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> These vehicles would be used for the struggle which was laying ahead.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Did you go and steal vehicles?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> We were on our way there, but along the way some of the vehicles we were driving in, came problems and in the end the vehicle theft expedition did not succeed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> The Sunday, the 24th of April, where were you then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Sunday the 24th, I was still on the game farm.  I did guard duty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> According to your application, Koper Myburgh arrived there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That was the Sunday evening, let's say late afternoon to the evening, he arrived there.  There was another meeting.  It was Gen Prinsloo, Brigadier Leon van der Merwe, Johan Smit, Abe Fourie and Commandant Dupie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a>	Our usual members who were there, were not allowed in this meeting.  Later the evening, after the meeting finished, I was called into this meeting and Nico Prinsloo asked me if I would go with Koper Myburgh to Koesterfontein on the farm, to go with him to his farm, to go and pick up certain items there and I said that was fine, I will do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> I went with Koper Myburgh, we went to his father's farm.  There I saw Clifton Barnard, Ettiene le Roux, Johan Vlok, who is also an applicant here, and Koekemoer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a>	They were busy in a little building.  There was a gas bottle on the table and around the gas bottle, they were busy sticking together explosives.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Did you know what they were busy doing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> I immediately realised at that stage, that it is them who caused the bomb explosion in Johannesburg.  We did not talk about it though, because at that stage I did not know what to say to them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a>	I received duty to do certain things at Koesterfontein.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Then you already knew that the bomb exploded in Johannesburg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And what were you supposed to go and pick up there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> When we arrived at the farm, there were a lot of pipe bombs which were wrapped in canvass, which was in the little room, and Koper Myburgh asked me to place this into the vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a>	I put a little bit of canvass in the boot of my car, and I placed the pipe bombs on top of that, as well as a 25 litre can of milk, which his mother gave us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Where did you take these pipe bombs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> It was taken to the game farm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> There was a meeting according to the evidence in front of this Committee, on the Sunday evening, on the game farm.  Where you present then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> I was not present at the meeting, but later Major Johan Smit called us together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> When Major Smit called us together, we went outside and Koper Myburgh, outside now, demonstrated a short pipe bomb to us, how it worked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How did he demonstrate it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Sorry?</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How did he demonstrate it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> He took it out, he told them what it was, a pipe bomb and he told them how to ignite it and then once you have ignited it, you've got three minutes to get away from this pipe bomb, otherwise you will kill yourself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> That evening, were you tasked to do certain duties?</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> When I got back from Koesterfontein, I went to General Prinsloo because Clifton Barnard, when I was on the farm, he asked me to go and hear from Prinsloo what happened about the vehicles he would have supplied us with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a>	On Koesterfontein I told Barnard that the vehicle expedition was not successful, so I don't think he would get vehicles at that stage.  But I still conveyed the instruction that I received, still went to Prinsloo to ask him if there is a vehicle and if there wasn't a vehicle available, I would make mine available.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Did you know why he needed a vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> At that stage I didn't know why the vehicle was needed.  Then I went to Nico Prinsloo on the game farm and I told him what Barnard asked me to ask him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a>	He said, you know there aren't any vehicles and I said well, I will make my vehicle available, considering that you need one that you can put a trailer onto, but on one condition.  He asked me what the condition was and I said I want to be the driver of my car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> So you were specifically asked to find a vehicle where you can hook something onto?</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And then what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> General Prinsloo then asked me if I would make my vehicle available the next morning, and I said yes, I would do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a>	Outside where the pipe bomb demonstrations took place, little groups were called out.  First they wanted drivers with vehicles which would have been available for the missions and people were told that two people will go with that vehicle, two people would go with that vehicle.  They also asked me if I would make my vehicle available, that was Commandant Dupie and Koper that asked me this, Koper Myburgh.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a>	I said that I have already had another duty to perform.  I cannot give them my vehicle for the pipe bomb mission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Did you know that the vehicles, these little groups which were called together, did you know that they were going out with pipe bombs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, I knew that.  They were pertinently told that, that they would go out on pipe bomb missions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Did you know where they were going?</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> What happened further?</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Then I went to bed.  Some of the groups' duties, this is Dupie and Myburgh who told them this, they brought them apart and said something to them, but I don't know what they were told, I went to bed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a>	Early the Monday morning, Dupie woke me up and told me it is time to go.  Me and Dupie then left for Koesterfontein.  On the way to Koesterfontein, I stopped at the garage, I think it was Sasol, I threw gas into my car and from there, we went to Koesterfontein.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a>	At Koesterfontein, once we arrived there, I've got a yellow Toyota car with a trailer at the back, and it was in the path towards Koesterfontein's house, and there were people busy.  The people who were busy with this trailer was Ettiene le Roux, Clifton Barnard and Koekemoer and Johan Vlok.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a>	Cliff Barnard called us together and told us okay, the trailer must be hooked onto my vehicle and that it is a trailer bomb which must go to Germiston.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And when you received the instruction, why did you adhere to it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> We were in a war and the election had to be stopped at all costs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Did you know where this bomb was going?</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That was the morning, early that morning Barnard told us that this bomb is going to Germiston.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Did you know to what specific place this was going?</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No, they did not say the specific place.  They said a vehicle must drive in front and the vehicle driving in front, would indicate where this bomb must be exploded.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Who had the task of detonating this bomb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Johan Vlok who was with me, he had the duty to detonate the bomb.</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Was there any changes made to your car regarding this bomb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Koekemoer, the way I built that bomb and earlier that evening, I saw how they built it, that two wires from the trailer would be extended up into my car and that at this place, they have to detonate this bomb.</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Meaning that you, yourself, would do it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, at that stage, I was willing to give my life for God, country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Who then all left for Germiston?</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> The vehicle who drove in front, we called it a guide vehicle, or the ghost vehicle, it was Johan du Plessis and my vehicle, the second vehicle which had the bomb, it was me and Johan Vlok.</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Was there any arrangements made of what the vehicle in front would do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> In both of the vehicles there were Defence Force radio's and the command on the radio would be that the vehicle in front would guide us on the road, and if there is a road block, they would warn us and if possible, we could turn around.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a>	In the area where the, the radio's did not work in this area where we drove, we drove a bit slower and we drove very close to each other up to where we left the bomb.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You said that you were willing to give your life for God, your volk and your country?</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What country is this, or father land?</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> At that stage I believed that it was the Volkstaat that would be established in the Western Transvaal and that the Boere Republics would be established there and that we would get it back in the election.</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What nation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> The Afrikaner nation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> You then went to Germiston?</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes.  Germiston itself, I did not know very well.  When we arrived there, the vehicle in front stopped and gave us a signal.  At that stage, I did not realise that the bomb must be dropped there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a>	I continued following and they immediately stopped.  Johan Vlok told me that I must drop the bomb off here.  The vehicle in front drove on, turned off in a side street.  When I got out of my vehicle to unhook the trailer, I saw taxi minibuses and I saw that it was a double lane, the taxi's came from the front, and people got out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a>	At that stage I told Vlok we cannot detonate the bomb now, we have to wait because with my vehicle, we cannot turn around.  If we make a U-turn, the streets were too narrow.  One of the minibuses continued. </p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a>	At that stage I also continued, because for me it was not the right time to detonate the bomb.  We carried on in the same road or in the same lane, we saw that there was a parking spot that was open.  We drove around the block, it was on the wrong side of the road, where the parking lot was open.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a>	I drove around the block to get into the right lane.  Vlok and myself got out, we unhooked this trailer and pushed it into this parking lot.  It was his task to detonate the bomb.  I got into the vehicle and waited for him to get in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a>	When he got into my vehicle, we drove on.  We stopped at the traffic light, the second traffic light was red and when we stopped there, the bomb exploded and from there, I went back to Koesterfontein.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> What did you do at Koesterfontein?</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> At Koesterfontein, I had to report back to Barnard then, Barnard and Koekemoer.  When we arrived there, I cannot remember, I do not think that there was anybody else, they were not there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a>	From there, we went to the game farm.  At the game farm, we found them where they were all together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> The following day, that is now the Tuesday, the 26th of April, where did you go then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That evening, when we saw over the news some of the pipe bomb missions haven't returned yet, and they said we have to move from our position.  General Nico and Leon van der Merwe said or asked me if I knew where the shooting range in Rustenburg was and I said yes, I knew.</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a>	They said that we will meet there together, the next morning.  The Tuesday morning very early, when we got up, the pipe bomb mission from Pretoria had not returned yet and through General Nico Prinsloo and I was given a task to drive in front because it was a red vehicle, because I saw on the news that there was a red vehicle at the Germiston bombing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Why did you have to drive in front?</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> They were afraid that if I drive with the convoy, that they would identify my vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> At the shooting range, did you receive any instructions there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> At the shooting range, when we arrived there, we were the first to arrive, but an hour later, a convoy arrived systematically which Nico Prinsloo and Leon called me and they told me that I must remove the tow bar from my vehicle.  I asked them why, it is a red vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a>	They said if there is not a tow bar, it would not be so obvious or suspicious.</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> So as I understand your evidence correct, Nico Prinsloo and Leon van der Merwe, did know about the mission you were on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Did you talk about this with them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No, I did not discuss it with them, but they did know about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> At the shooting range, evidence was already given to this Committee, certain people that was Tuesday evening, the 26th of April, went to their wives where they lived or stayed at your farm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Did you go with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> After I took the tow bar from my vehicle, Commandant asked me to go with to the game farm.  The reason why he asked me was - at that stage I didn't want to go to the wives - the reason was that if there were problems where the wives were and they would move to another area, I did know where they were going if they would move and then I could probably show them which was the shortest way to get there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Apart from being uncomfortable for the women at Cliff Barnard's farm, why did they go and stay at your farm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> There was enough facilities for them and because it was told that we were in a war situation now.  That the wives must be in a secure place and 20 kilometres from where the wives where, there was 400 AWB people gathered together with their families.  They were armed, and they had radio communication with each other if problems would arise.</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Did they know that the wives were on this farm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> From the shooting range, did you then leave the Tuesday evening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, we left to Ottosdal where the farm was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And Wednesday, the day of the election, 27th of April?</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> The day of the election, we went back to Ventersdorp.  The reason why we went to Ventersdorp was that two of the men that went with us, their wives in the meantime, they did not want to be part of the group of women who was together there and they went to Ventersdorp to go back to their homes, or Johannesburg where they lived.  They did not want to be part of the struggle any more.</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a>	In order for them to get to their wives, we went to Ventersdorp.  We went round to the AWB Head Office.  Fourie and myself went to Terreblanche where he was busy in the office, he was on the phone.  After Mr Terreblanche finished with his phone call, he told us that early in the morning Nico Prinsloo and Leon van der Merwe and people in Pretoria, were also arrested for the bomb plantings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a>	He then told us that we must go back to the shooting range and tell the people there that if we are arrested, that we must make no statements and that we must make use of our right, to keep quiet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Did you then go to the shooting range?</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, from there we went to the shooting range.  On the way Abe Fourie, I asked him to go along to one farm, there were certain things that I wanted to pick up there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a>	We stopped at the farm, just before we drove into the farm, a vehicle came from Rustenburg, it flashed its lights and said that we must not go to the shooting range, they are busy arresting the people at the shooting range.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> You did not then go back?</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No, we did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And you were arrested later?</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, three to four months later I was arrested in Ottosdal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> This whole operation that took place, under whose command was this whole gathering?</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> I believe the AWB leader, Terreblanche, the General Staff because at various areas in the Western Transvaal, AWB Commanders came together with different Generals, who were tasked for this mission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Specifically at this game farm, where you were, was there any General that was in command?</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> At the game farm, Nico Prinsloo was the Commanding Officer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> The place where you left the bomb, was this indicated to you where to leave this bomb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Did you discuss beforehand that there would be a specific target?</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> There were no specific targets indicated to us.  It was general public in the area.  If there were white people, black people, AWB people, CP people, it didn't matter who were killed in this bomb planting.  We didn't have a specific task to say, to target a specific group of people, it was in order to disrupt the election, to prevent the people from taking part in the election.</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr De Wet, the chances that a member of the AWB would die in that situation was very slim,  because at that stage your plans were that everybody would be gathered in Ventersdorp?</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> My vehicle with the bomb, I had the risk that I would lose my life.</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, I understand, but general members of the public, it wouldn't be a big chance that there would be an AWB members, because everybody was in Ventersdorp?</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> I believe at that stage, there were some AWB people who were not willing to give everything up and move to the Volkstaat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Mr De Wet, evidence was given by Mr Fourie that he sold everything, he left his job in order to move up to the Western Transvaal.  What was your situation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Myself, the place where I worked at a mine and with the Affirmative Action, it was told to me that I was one of the people who had to leave because also of my right wing activities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a>	I then took a package and I went to Ventersdorp where at the Head Office of the AWB, I started a guard section in order to protect Eugene Terreblanche and his family.</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Was this before the election?</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, it was before the election.</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Do you know if Mr Terreblanche ever mentioned the revolution that will begin?</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> It was general knowledge that there is a revolution on its way and in his meeting and speeches, he said that revolution will take place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Did he personally talk to you about this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, at one stage we went to a meeting, I protected him, where Constand Viljoen and some of the Generals attended.  On the way back to Ventersdorp, it was in Pretoria, on the way back to Ventersdorp he mentioned that Constand Viljoen told him that with the war that is coming, he will appoint the cities to Eugene Terreblanche.</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> What did you understand regarding this appointment to Eugene Terreblanche?</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> In January/February we went to the Skilpad Hall in Pretoria where Viljoen and some of the other Generals and right wing leaders were together.  It was said that we will not negotiate with the National Party or the ANC/SACP alliance, that we will fight this war.</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a>	And then I concluded that because it was war talk at every single meeting, that Mr Terreblanche's Wenkommando will use the cities to make war.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How many people would that be in the Wenkommando?</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Sir, at that stage as far as I know, there were more than 40 000 AWB members in the Western Transvaal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I am talking about these people who would fight in the war?</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> In total the AWB and the right wing spectrum, it was more than a million people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that what Terreblanche said to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, that is what Constand Viljoen and Terreblanche said in their speeches regarding the membership.</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was that the truth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, I believed that it was the truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Today I know that we were only a small group that were misled.</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> This war talk that you had heard, wasn't the revolution supposed to start once the ANC took over, wasn't that what your leaders were saying to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> We were already within a revolution since the National Party started to negotiate with the ANC with a one man, one vote.</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a>	But the revolution would begin the day when the ANC takes over.</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What was wrong with the one man, one vote, idea?</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Sir, because I believed in a Volkstaat ideal that when the ANC takes over, they will not look after my interests.  They want us to unite, that the culture which you support, must be mixed now and I don't want my culture and religion to mix with others.</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Religion as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, religion as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> You see, my problem is that the ANC had not taken over yet when you offered your car and when you went out on this particular mission, so where does your action on that day, fit into the call up to start this revolution once the ANC took over?  What was your understanding?</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Mr Chairperson, what I understood regarding this was that we already thought that the revolution against the National Party and the ANC/SACP alliance with certain speeches by the ANC that they will not give us a Volkstaat and the ANC leaders said Kill the Boer, Kill the Farmer.  We were already in a revolution and in a war struggle with the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a>	It was not specifically targeted, or we did not specifically say that we were going to start today, it was a thing that had a long period of time, it came over a long period of time and because the ANC said we will not receive the Volkstaat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> According to the question asked by the panel member, you said that the revolution already started.  Do you carry any knowledge with regards to any bombs which exploded before the explosions which were triggered by your members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct Chairperson.  In the Western Transvaal, and this already happened in 1993, there were bomb explosions in several places in the Western Transvaal, Free State and Mr Terreblanche said that he spoke to the National Party at meetings, that if they do not want to listen, he will plant another bomb the next day, tomorrow or the day after, a bomb did explode.</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> The bombs you were talking about, did you know which group, which group was responsible for those bombs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> I knew it was AWB members who were responsible, people who were involved with the AWB, it is them who planted the bombs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did the AWB by means of Terreblanche or someone else, did they admit that those bombs were detonated by the AWB or on behalf of the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No Chairperson, Terreblanche himself did not admit it, but at a meeting he said tomorrow another meeting would explode if they do not want to listen.  So I accepted that it carried his approval.</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That bothers me - the people, how would they have received the message if they did not know who was responsible for the bombings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Chairperson, every time when there was a group of people that were involved in bomb explosions, there was a splinter group, I don't know how to call it any other way, which worked under a (indistinct) name of the AWB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a>	Think of the bomb explosion in Johannesburg, that was the BKA who accepted responsibility for it.  In Rustenburg in 1992 and 1993, there was also another bomb explosion which was The Boere Ordevolk people said they were responsible for it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a>	At that stage it was people who were directly involved with the AWB and for me, it was the standard that as soon as there was a certain little group who do things within the AWB, they do not use the AWB's name, but they use, they are part of the AWB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But I still do not understand, at that stage you were advised to prepare yourself for a revolution and you believe in this, because certain people in leadership positions, said certain things.</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a>	In meetings of the AWB it is accepted that these bombs, were exploded by the AWB because they wanted this Volkstaat.  But how would the Nationalists at that stage, how would they have known that this bomb was exploded by the AWB because they wanted a Volkstaat?</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Chairperson, according to Mr Terreblanche's utterances, and I am going to try and remember his words when he said if they do not want to listen, tomorrow there will be another bomb.</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a>	Because of what he said there, I accepted that it was his way of conveying it to the National Party.</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How would the Nationalists have found out about it?  Everybody knows that the AWB's meetings were not the greatest meetings in this country?</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Because of the fact that right-wingers were involved in the explosions, the right wing organisations or splinter groups which accepted responsibility for it, because of that, I assumed that the National Party  would understand it as a right wing resistance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And all these splinter groups, did they have one thing in common, one cause and that is to get the Volkstaat?</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> You spoke about splinter groups as you called it, which took responsibility for what happened, can you be a bit more specific with regard to the bombs that we are dealing with here in this trial?</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a>	Which groups accepted responsibility for which bombs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Chairperson, the Bree Street, Johannesburg explosion, the first news report which came on TV was that the SACP took responsibility for it and that is facts that came from the news, from the TV news.</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a>	With the second report, the SACP distanced themselves from the bombs and then it was said that the BKA took responsibility for it.  At that stage, all I knew of the BKA was that Constand Viljoen was at one stage part of that group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> When you talk about the SACP, do you mean the Conservative Party or the Communist Party?</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No, the Communist Party Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> And except for the Bree Street bomb where the report said that the BKA took responsibility for it, was there any other groups which you can specifically mention, who took responsibility?</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> It was the only one that was made known on the news.</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> How did you regard the BKA?</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> What I know about the BKA is that it was Mr Viljoen, Terreblanche, Ferdi Hartzenberg, the Mine Workers' Union and the Agricultural Unions, it was a group of 12 members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Was it leaders - were they leaders or was it only them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No, it was only the leadership of the splinter group which served under the Freedom Front or operated under the Freedom Front and the AWB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> You were asked about how the message would be conveyed to the National Party, but if you look at Exhibit F where the speech was made, where you were present, in the second paragraph, in a meeting where they received the Freedom of Lichtenburg, Mr Terreblanche referred to the bomb explosions in the Western Transvaal, Free State and said that they would increase if Afrikaners do not receive their Volkstaat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a>	Is that how you remember the speech and how it took place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct Chairperson, and because of these utterance, we accepted that it was a basic instruction for us and for the groups who took part in the revolution, that there will be a war.</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> If you listen to such a speech and it is taken up by the media, then it is quite evident, if you look at this report now, that the AWB was involved?</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, that is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Is that how you understand it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is how I see it, that is how I understand it Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> I want to take you back, you also said that Terreblanche said the AWB is responsible for the cities.  Why on the game farm at Magaliesburg, why did you gather there, do you know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Chairperson, I cannot say exactly why, but at that stage, we were informed that the game farm is very close to the Volkstaat's boundaries and to operate from there, and I am using the English expression, it is a hit and run.</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a>	You can go from there, complete your mission and return and it was a very appropriate place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> So, it is close to the cities?</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, it is close to the cities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> This hit and run, you are aware of the AWB's policy which you will find in a little book which was published and was given out by Oelofse and in the first phase, he talks about the first phase.  Did you study this booklet before you joined the Ystergarde?</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And what was the view of the AWB as it is set out in this specific book with regards to guerrilla warfare?</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> It was said that the AWB associates himself with that and that these actions would meet their approval.</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a>	I also received training in order to do these things.</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> What do you understand when we talk about guerrilla warfare?</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Guerrilla warfare implies, if you look at the border, we went from South Africa to Angola.  For us it was no longer a border war, but a city war, so I was stationed at a place and I go from there, and I make war and I return where I received my protection.</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And you do this in small groups?</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, we do it in small groups.</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> You mentioned that the BKA, "Boere Krisis Aksie" took responsibility for the bomb in Bree Street, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Were you present on the game farm when certain people from Natal arrived and Johan Smit welcomed them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> I was not present when they arrived there, I think when they arrived I was busy with my mission to Germiston.</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> During your trial in the High Court in Johannesburg, you gave evidence that Johan Smit told the Natalians that the BKA took responsibility for the bomb.  Can you remember that evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, I can.</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Mr De Wet, you gave evidence in your trial, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Were you speaking the truth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No Chairperson, in the Supreme Court of South Africa I lied.  The reason I lied, was to prove my innocence in that matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> When you left on the day of the election, were you on the run?</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You are accused?</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> I beg your pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You are guilty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, I am.</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I am not talking about the findings, but in reality are you guilty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> In reality I am guilty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How did you want to prove your innocence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> By telling certain lies and getting witnesses to come and say that I wasn't involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Mr De Wet, you are now applying for amnesty for all the explosions, why?  You were not involved in all the explosions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Chairperson, I apply because I was involved with a group of people who were involved in a revolution and who went out to commit acts of terror in order to stop the elections and to create chaos.</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a>	That is why I am applying for amnesty, I associate myself with them and I was part of the group of people who did that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And you also took the pipe bombs to the game farm, and you knew these missions were going to take place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> When you left the shooting range the Tuesday, did you know that other bombs were going out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Chairperson, we were told that the war would take place until we have reached our ideal, which is the Volkstaat, so I accepted that there would be further bomb explosions and also that we were going to commit ourselves to an armed struggle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Once you started running, did you learn about the explosion at the Jan Smuts airport?</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> The morning when we were at the Head Office of the AWB, Mr Terreblanche said that there was a report on the radio that a bomb exploded at Jan Smuts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> What did you think then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> I suspected that it was the people who were at the shooting range, it was one of their missions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Eugene Terreblanche said a bomb had exploded, or one of your bombs, as in associating himself with the action, can you just clarify that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Mr Chairperson, Mr Terreblanche said a bomb exploded at Jan Smuts.  He did not say that it was a bomb that we were involved in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a>	He only said a bomb exploded.</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Can I just follow up on that, when he said a bomb, you said that you suspected, but did you not in reality know that it was one of your bombs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Chairperson, at that stage I was not at the shooting range to know that it was a bomb that we made there.  The only bomb that I was certain about, was the Germiston bomb, because I saw that it was built.</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But did you suspect that it was one of the bombs from your unit, or did you suspect that it was an AWB bomb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> I suspected that it was the unit that we were involved, that it was them who created the bomb explosion because that was the only bomb explosions at that time, it was coming from our group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> And did you actually discuss this with Mr Terreblanche, did you say to him, oh yes, that is one of ours?  Did you, yourself then identify with that and say oh, that must be one of ours because you were feeling good about this, all these terrorist acts of yours because of your objective, whatever that might have been?</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Mr Chairman, I did not discuss this with Mr Terreblanche, because the problem was that people were arrested because of these bomb explosions, and we wanted to get back as quick as possible to the shooting range, to report to them and tell them that people are being arrested because of the bomb explosions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> But as one of Mr Terreblanche's former bodyguards, you were quite close to him, it is the type of thing you would normally have discussed with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct Mr Chairperson, but at that stage I did not, because of the people being arrested and we wanted to get to the shooting range as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why did you suspect that it was one of your bombs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Mr Chairperson, at that stage we were told, this is when I was at Brigadier Leon van der Merwe's house, that the people as they were moving up to the Volkstaat, there would be more bomb explosions in the Free State, Cape Province and Natal and that up until that point, none of those bomb explosions or any chaos which would have been spread, none of that took place and that is why I accepted that the explosion at Jan Smuts was part of the group that we were involved with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Which group was this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Us who were at the game farm and then moved to the shooting range.  The Ystergarde, we weren't only Ystergarde members, there were also Natalians and in reality they came from the AWB's Wenkommando.</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So the group you are referring to, is the AWB group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Let's call it the AWB group because the Ystergarde and the Natalians were part of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Up until that point, this group the AWB group, did not claim responsibility for any bomb, is that not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Every time when somebody takes responsibility for a bomb, it was taken by one of the splinter groups?</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In the light thereof, why did you suspect that the bomb to which Mr Terreblanche referred to as a bomb, was maybe that it was coming from the AWB's side?</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> It was my personal opinion at that stage Chairperson, I accepted and assumed that the bomb which exploded at Jan Smuts, came from our group which was gathered together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Because all the bomb explosions up until that point, came from us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That is the point I am trying to make and this is what is bothering me, at that stage it was always a splinter group which took responsibility, not the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is how I accepted it at that stage Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Mr de Wet, it is not quite clear to me what you mean with a splinter group, you yourself said you didn't know what word to use.</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a>	Can you not explain to us what you regard as a splinter group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Chairperson, if I must explain at one stage there were people in Rustenburg in 1993 and 1992, who planted a bomb.  At that stage he was the Commander of the AWB's Wenkommando and he for me, he was - the commando unit who was in the Brits area, he was the Commander of that area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a>	He was involved in that bombing, he was a member of the AWB, he was a Commandant in the AWB, but when he was arrested for the bombing, it was the Boere Ordevolk who took responsibility for the explosion of the bomb.  For me, it was that because the AWB was involved in a political struggle, that they did not use the AWB's name, but a group which associated themselves with the AWB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a>	A splinter group is just a group which breaks away from the main group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Are you saying to us now that this BKA and Boere Orde group is part of the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> These are groups who break away from the AWB, who is not doing it under the name of the AWB, but doing it under their own organisations, like the Boere Ordevolk, or Boere Krisis Aksie. They are still a member of the AWB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> So what you are actually saying, I don't know if you know the word, they were affiliated or an affiliated group of the AWB, is that what you mean?</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> You must be very careful with the words that you use, because a splinter group means that it is a separate group and an affiliated group means that it is a group that reconcile themselves and see themselves as part of the AWB, you must be very careful with the words that you use, because it can be very confusing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The way I understand your evidence thus far is that you accept that for those bomb plantings, it was in a capacity of the splinter groups as you called them, not in the name of the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No Mr Chairman, the AWB never took responsibility for it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Can I just come back here, because even this affiliated groups give me a problem.  If I understand you correctly, there is a group of members who do something under a pseudonym or does something under another name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Mr Chairperson, it is not a pseudonym, it is names that after a while, you can call it a type of code name because suddenly that organisation or group, was never part of the AWB after the deeds were done, these groups would then use this name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> It is a name for an action or an opportunity, so it depends on the opportunity or the circumstances?</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did you see it as part of the AWB's initiative or did you see it as part of a group of individuals' agenda?</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No Mr Chairperson, it had the approval of the AWB and other institutions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did they have the approval or did you see them as part of their own personal agenda?</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, it was part of their agenda, because if someone did something, they would then take responsibility for it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You don't think that they just got on the wagon later on, got on the bandwagon in order to focus attention to themselves and that it not necessarily was planned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No Mr Chairperson, for me it was deeds that were planned because in circles they talked about the right wing who did it or the AWB who did it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> The series of bomb plantings that took place, would you describe that as a splinter group action?</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No Mr Chairperson, that what I understood from Nico Prinsloo and Barnard, is that the AWB would take responsibility for it because it was instructions that came directly from Eugene Terreblanche.</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I think you should in this evidence, keep with the splinter group concept because otherwise we are going to get confused.  We can try and understand the concept better, but I don't think you must use other names for the same term.</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, on behalf of the victim for whom I appear and I believe on behalf of Ms Cambanis who sits next to me, we are deeply disturbed by the questioning which has just taken place.  We would like a few minutes to consider our position and to see whether an application ought not to be considered or not.  We would just like about a ten minute</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a>adjournment, possibly an early tea adjournment even.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> ... might be to move an application for the recusal of one of the members of the Committee, Mr Wynand Malan.  Mr Chairman, Section 36 of the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act makes it quite clear that the Commission and every member of the staff, shall function without any political or other bias or interference and shall be independent.</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a>	It is my submission that Mr Malan has indicated by his questioning, that he is biased in favour of the applicants, that he is aware of the applicant's difficulties and has asked questions of a particular nature designed to stop certain holes which have appeared in the applicant's case.  In order to understand the application Mr Chairman I need to give a bit of background.</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a>	Mr Chairman, it is the applicant's contention that they were acting on the orders and instructions of the AWB and under their auspices when these dastardly deeds were committed in Bree Street, Germiston and other places.	What has emerged after Mr Barnard and Mr Myburgh withdrew their applications, is that they were left without Mr Barnard who had a large role to play in the planning, according to the documents, a large role to play in the planning.  They are left in the situation where they don't know whether Mr Barnard had any real role to play in the AWB, they don't know his rank, they know nothing about him. They don't know where he gets his instructions from.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a>	What we do know is that an organisation by the name of Boere Krisis Aksie took responsibility for the bomb in Bree Street, what we do know is that there is no evidence before this Court at, before this Committee at this stage that the AWB has taken responsibility for the bombings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a>	In fact, on the contrary it seems that the AWB at no stage publicly took responsibility.  Now, that presents a problem for the applicants in that the applicants may well end in these proceedings, with there being a strong belief that the actions undertaken by inter alia Mr Barnard, upon which this particular applicant in the witness box at the moment, also relies, that those actions were taken either by Mr Barnard in his personal capacity or as part of another organisation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a>	It is our submission that Mr Malan has, in his questioning of this witness, taken it upon himself to assist the witness in demonstrating that actions that were taken, even if they were taken by other groups, were actions of the AWB and indeed the last question which was asked, was to the effect - did you see it as part, that is now the ANC, the AWB's planning and agenda and he promptly said that that is the case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a>	Also there was questions which suggested quite clearly that the answer should be that this was part of the AWB, that this carried the approval of the AWB and as I say, (indistinct) with it in fact being part of the AWB's planning and agenda.</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a>	This is asked, with respect, by the learned member of the Committee, at a time when he is aware that this particular witness has no knowledge of the planning and agenda, he has never testified that he knows what the AWB's agenda was in relation to the splinter groups, he didn't know what the AWB's plan was in regard to the Bree Street bomb, in fact according to his evidence, he knew nothing about it before the bomb actually went off.  Yet, all these questions are designed to again bring these actions by these desperate people, and at this stage, no evidence that they were acting on behalf of the AWB, under the umbrella of the AWB and in our submission, the reason for that is quite clear, the evidence at this stage is going very much against the applicants in proving that these were actions of the AWB, that they were orders carried out on behalf of the AWB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a>	At this stage the closest one can get is that some of these acts were committed under the orders possibly of Mr Barnard.   It is our submission that there are other issues, which still need to be dealt with and one of the issues which ought to have been dealt with before Mr Malan suggested that this was all part of the planning and the agenda of the AWB, is what is the status of these splinter organisations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a>	The witness' evidence is clear that they were separate from the AWB, it was only during questioning that the seed was planted that they may in fact have been the AWB.  Mr Chairman, there has been evidence in previous applications before the Amnesty Committee that the Boere Ordevolk exists as a separate organisation and indeed if I can refer you to the amnesty decision in relation to David Petrus Botha, Adriaan Smuts and Eugene Marais heard in Durban on the 12th of August 1996, it is clear from the majority decision in that case, that the Orde Boerevolk operates under the leadership of a Mr Piet Rudolph, that it is more militant than the AWB and that this organisation and members of this organisation, have to take an oath which is not the same as an oath which the AWB members would take, and certainly their aims and objectives are different to that of the AWB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a>	Before any of that could have been dealt with, Mr Malan has already taken the view, in our submission, and in our submission taken more than the view and indeed has made up his mind that these splinter groups are in fact part of the AWB, part of its planning, part of its agenda and that therefore they should not be seen as separate to the AWB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a>	There is, with respect, no objective evidence and there is nothing at all on record, to suggest that that is the case or that those suggestions should have been made at this particular stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a>	We submit that this demonstrates on an objective basis, never mind the subjective basis which the Supreme Court of Appeal indicated in S v Malindi &amp; Others, that Mr Malan has made up his mind about certain aspects of this application, that he is showing bias in assisting the applicants to overcome what is clearly a difficulty standing in their way and we accordingly submit that in the light of the comments which have been made by Mr Malan and his thinking which is quite clearly in favour of finding that even if there were splinter groups, they were AWB - it was still the AWB's agenda and purpose in action, that that is a matter which ought not to have been expressed at this stage and we respectfully submit that from an objective and certainly from a subjective point of view, it is clear that Mr Malan has made up his mind about certain aspects of this application before hearing any evidence from the victims, never mind having heard all the evidence on behalf of the applicants.</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a>	Mr Chairman, I also want to point out that Mr Malan has intervened previously in this application and we submit that when those interventions are taken globally, then it is clear that there is a bias in favour of the applicants.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a>	I wish to refer to only one other incident, and that is when Mr Fourie was testifying and again it was clear under cross-examination by myself, that Mr Fourie could not in any way say that he either committed, aided, planned, advised or ordered or any of the requirements in the Act, anything to do with the Bree Street bombing, Mr Malan's intervention at that stage was to say to the witness well, you associated yourself with that bombing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a>	Again, attempting to assist an applicant to bring himself into the net so that he can apply successfully and that he can be successful in his amnesty application.  It is therefore with some regret, it is my unpleasant task then to ask that Mr Malan recuse himself from the Committee, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> Just for purposes of the record, may I just state that I associate myself with the argument submitted by Adv Landman in this matter.  I have nothing further to add, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Anybody else wish to associate themselves with the application?  No?</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a>	Mr Landman, you referred to certain comments made by Mr Malan.  Do you argue that that was intended to assist the applicant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> That is my argument yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Which comments would these be?</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Mr Commissioner, when I refer to comments, comments some of them, phrased as if they were questions, but clearly in circumstances where the answer was clear, for example to Mr Fourie that he in fact associated himself with the acts which were committed, in regard to Mr De Wet's application, comments such as that the actions which were committed under what was called pseudonym, a word in my submission which was brought up by Mr Malan, that that carried the approval of the AWB, that it was part of the AWB's planning and agenda, this at a time when there is no evidence whatsoever that that was part of the planning and agenda.</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a>	Also the suggestion which was made not from the witness, but by Mr Malan, that these were merely coincidental or incident names which were used in order to possibly cover up a connection with the AWB.   That is not this witness' evidence and we submit that these are all matters which are assisting and are designed to assist and at the very least, certainly have the effect of assisting Mr De Wet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Does the matter as to whether it came to the rescue, assuming that your argument is correct, that Mr Malan's comments came to the rescue of certain applicants, is that factual?  Did it come to their assistance?</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Well, our submission it certainly shows an attempt to assist the ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Does it matter whether it did get that result or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Our submission, it doesn't matter whether it does achieve that result or not, but the fact of the matter is that in response to these highly suggestive questions which, we submit, demonstrate Mr Malan's state of mind, that the witnesses were more than eager, to accept and entertain what was said by Mr Malan and to make it part in effect, part of their case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you say from these comments, you submit that we can come to a conclusion that he has taken a particular view in favour of the applicants?</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> That is our submission, that is my submission, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So really, the allegation as to biasness is based on one aspect, that his comments are such that one can draw a conclusion as to biasness in favour of the applicants?</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, our submission is that to prove bias in many cases, is difficult in the sense that it is a question of a state of mind of a particular person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a>	The only way in which, one of the only ways in which one is able to determine the state of mind of a person, is to analyse what that person has said or done.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Doesn't the test go further and to examine why such questions were posed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, we submit that it is relevant to look at the context within which those questions were posed.  The questions were posed in the context of another member of the Committee, asking questions as to whether or not these were affiliated groups or not so you now have a situation of well, maybe the Boere Krisis Aksie as an organisation is somehow affiliated to the AWB, that is what came out from Adv Bosman's questioning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a>	Mr Malan, however, went much further than that.  What he then suggested to the witness and indeed, this was - it was put in a sense and certainly it came across from this side, that this is how he in fact sees the situation.  This is how it should be seen, namely that these are merely pseudonyms, these are names which are used behind which the AWB members hide, whereas in fact it is AWB members and AWB policy and planning which has been put into effect behind these pseudonyms.  That of course is one ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That is one view.  Isn't it possible to have another view and that is that that is what the witness thinks, whether it is true or not, that was how the witness saw it at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, our submission is that that is not how the witness saw it.  Indeed his evidence before the intervention from the Committee, and I talk in this case of both Mr Malan and Adv Bosman, at that stage it was clear that these were separate groups, these were the Boere Ordevolk and other organisations that were separate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a>	It was on suggestions by, it came out of the evidence or rather the examination by Adv Bosman, that they were what was in the words of the Committee member, affiliated groups.  An affiliated group is a group, it is something which operates separately, but is somehow connected to another group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a>	What Mr Malan then did was to attempt to destroy that distinction altogether in order once again to bring the actions of those groups, into and under the umbrella of the AWB by now watering down the concept of affiliated groups, now to simply to be pseudonyms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a>	Our submission is that that is an indication of Mr Malan's efforts in our submission, to demonstrate via this witness' answers, but to demonstrate and to plant a seed in everyone's mind, that well, whatever is said about splinter groups, this is nevertheless in fact AWB acting in whatever way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The ordinary interpretation of splinter groups, what would you say that is?</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Well, a splinter group is a group which has a separate identity, which has moved away from a organisation to which it originally belonged.  For example the PAC would have become a splinter group of the ANC and there is no suggestion in anyone's mind that the PAC is now part of the ANC, in fact there is a lot of people who would ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Quite the contrary.</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Would be most angry if one said that, and in our submission in the same way, a splinter group and in particular, I have already referred to the Boere Ordevolk, which we suggest is now clear from the evidence, is not simply just an alias.</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I accept that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> But what Mr Malan has attempted to plant is that well, these organisations doesn't count, they don't count.</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I raise that issue and as my memory serves me, the witness indicated that he, before coining the phrase splinter group, that he was not sure as to how to describe this group, or these groups, "just call it splinter group", - with your argument?</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Because at no stage did he attempt to suggest that these were merely alias which ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, I accept that but he was trying to find the proper phraseology if you want to call it and came up with the phrase splinter group.  I am not saying that you are incorrect in your submissions, I am just asking you to assist me in putting your argument in that kind of context.</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, inasmuch as there may have been some confusion about what he was referring to ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The fact of the matter is that he did preface his answer at that stage, he said I don't know what to call it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> He then went on to refer to a organisation which we now know has come before one of the Committees before and that is the Boere Ordevolk.  Once he has done that, in our submission is clear that we now are talking about an organisation, it has a name now and especially in the light of the fact that one of the enquiries which this Committee will have to consider carefully is whether or not this is an AWB action or whether the Bree Street bombing was Boere Krisis Aksie or whether it was Barnard incorporated, we don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Landman, my problem is not that the witness may or not have fortuitously taken advantage of the opportunity to flower his evidence, that is another matter, my concern at the moment is that the opportunity created by the questions from Mr Malan was taken advantage of perhaps, but in creating the opportunity, was Mr Malan being biased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> In our submission ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And was he biased and can we properly say that he was biased if we take into consideration the preface which I referred to before the witness coined the phrase splinter group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, our submission still is that when all of his questions are taken into account, that not only does it refer to these alias,  and suggest that it was merely an alias it goes further.  It goes further.</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a>	There are suggestions made that what these individuals were doing, that that was being done with at least the approval of the AWB and that the questions asked well, did you see it as part of the AWB's planning and agenda and again, the clear suggestion in my submission, in all of that evidence, is that I want you to say and I want you to understand that as I see this whole case, that everything that was done in connection with the Bree Street bomb and the other bombings, was part of the planning and agenda of the AWB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Landman, the questioning and the attempting to take advantage of this opportunity to colour his evidence, may in fact operate against the witness, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, it may well operate against the witness.  My submission, the enquiry really at this stage is an enquiry of an objective basis as to whether Mr Malan has indicated in his questioning, that he has formed a particular view that the actions of Mr Barnard and the others, on whose behalf those actions were done.</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a>	Our submission is that this is clear that what Mr Malan was attempting to achieve here, was to attempt to destroy any suggestion that there might be in the evidence, that Mr Barnard might have been acting on his own, alternatively that Mr Barnard might have been acting on behalf of another group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a>	What Mr Malan has attempted to do in this questioning, and these are the questions of Mr Malan, not of the witness, it is Mr Malan who suggests to the witness but those are only alias, what was being done by these so-called alias groups, was in fact being done as part of the planning and the agenda of the AWB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a>	In our submission that indicates quite clearly that that is Mr Malan's view of the matter and that is Mr Malan's clear view, that that is in fact what he intends to find.</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a>	Mr Chairman, the other aspect of the matter is of course that Mr Malan has asked these questions and clearly in his own mind, he will know what the effect of those questions must have been, with respect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you discount the possibility of the questions being posed merely to clarify certain things?</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> That is so.  We submit that in the context of the question and the manner in which these questions were being asked, that that possibility ought to be discounted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, just lastly, in our submission if one listens to the questioning, it is clear that this was an attempt to put words into the mouth of Mr de Wet, as well as Mr Fourie on an earlier occasion, in order to ensure that the evidence comes out in a particular fashion, which would be favourable to the applicants.</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a>	That is all I have to say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you say that falsifies the submission of biasness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> That is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Prior, do you have any submissions to make?</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Mr Chairman, from the Evidence Leader's position, certainly there was no understanding from my position that there was any bias, in fact I think that Mr Malan, right at the end said when you now refer to these groups, to avoid confusion, refer to them as splinter groups, so that we know what you are talking about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a>	Certainly I cannot support the application.  Certainly from where I am sitting, I did not understand the questioning by Mr Malan to convey any sense of bias, obviously that is from my position, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a><span class="speaker">COUNSEL:</span> Committee would be, whether we would have to start again or get a re-appointment of the three remaining members, if somebody could just think about that, because I would hate to have wasted a week of my life.</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Anybody (indistinct) themselves, or himself or herself, the convenience of the Committee or the TRC is not a matter I must consider.  I must consider the application and grant it or refuse it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a>	Conveniences of any particular individual or Committee, is not a factor I must keep into consideration.</p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a>	Yes, well the point is made and I will certainly check.  We will adjourn and I - we will take the early ...</p>

<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Before we adjourned, there was a substantive application for me to make a ruling in respect of an application for the recusal from the Committee, by Mr Malan.</p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a>	We have considered the matter and we have come to the conclusion that the application should not succeed.  The ruling is therefore that the application is refused and without wanting to sound topical we will give reasons if necessary at a later stage.</p>

<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> As far as I was concerned, no, it was the AWB</p>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a>who was involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Why do you say so according to your opinion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Because the instructions came from Nico Prinsloo and Brigadier Van der Merwe.  Those were the instructions I received from them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a>	And if it did not carry Eugene Terreblanche's approval, then I don't think Prinsloo would not have given the instructions if he did not carry the approval of Terreblanche.</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> You were a member of the Ystergarde, what was Nico Prinsloo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> He was the Secretary General of the AWB.  At one stage he was a Captain in the Ystergarde, but for this operation, he was placed in the position of General over the Ystergarde, that is how I saw it at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> From a Captain to General?</p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> He was a General in the Staff Generals and because he represented us on the Staff Generals, that is why I believe he became General over us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> What you are saying is that when he was a member of the Ystergarde, before he joined the Staff Generals he was a Captain?</p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> When you are selected to become a Garde, you either become a Lieutenant or a Captain and then there will be later a promotion and that would happen if you work yourself up or certain concessions are made.</p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a>	He was a Captain in the Garde, even though he served on the Staff Generals before that, he was Secretary General of the AWB, but it was a requirement that everybody who worked for Terreblanche, had to have training in the Garde and that is why I said he was a Captain, because he successfully succeeded in the training.</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> When did he become a General?</p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Before he joined the Garde course, he was a General, he served as Secretary General of the AWB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> So do I understand your evidence now correctly that he was a member of the Staff Generals?</p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And then he had to do a course at the Ystergarde?</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, he had to do that because he was directly involved in the security of Mr Terreblanche and the protection of Mr Terreblanche.</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And there he gained the rank of Captain?</p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> At that stage, when the operation was going on, where was he functioning?  Was he at Head Office or was he in another Division?</p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> He was working at Head Office, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Directly under Eugene Terreblanche?</p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, together with Terreblanche in his office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And Brigadier Leon van der Merwe, what was his position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> He was a Brigadier in the Ystergarde and he was also responsible for the protection of Mr Terreblanche.</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Where was his office, in which area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> His office was in the office together with the offices of Terreblanche, in the complex where the AWB had its Headquarters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> So according to you, as far as you were concerned, the instruction was from the AWB and then you referred to these two people who had direct contact with Head Office?</p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And any other Generals, did you see any of the other Generals at these gatherings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Where we got together at the game farm, there was General Andries Terreblanche, that is Eugene Terreblanche's brother, he was there as well as other Generals.</p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a>	If I remember, that was the Saturday when we arrived there.  There was an Orde group which some people attended and some of the Generals were present there.  General Alec Cruywagen, he was also there at a certain stage.  Which day exactly it was, I cannot remember, but I know he was there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> An Orde group meeting, is that a closed meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is a closed meeting Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr De Wet, can you speak a little bit slower. MR DE WET:   I will try Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> During this operation, you received instructions from General Nico Prinsloo in order to make your vehicle available?</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> How did you see this instruction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> To me it was a question of a General giving me an instruction, we were together as a group.  He first asked me if I would make my vehicle available and I said yes, I would, and then I accepted his instruction and therefore I made it available.</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> An instruction from a private person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No, it was an instruction from the General who was with us at the game farm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Who acted on behalf of who?</p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> On behalf of the AWB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr De Wet, please explain something to me.  I do not follow you very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a>	You are saying that at that stage you did what you did, because there was an instruction.  Didn't you want to do it yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> The struggle for freedom, it was also an ideal that I strived for, that was to obtain a Volkstaat.  Because I was told that there was a war, I voluntarily made myself available for the struggle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So do I understand you correctly, the instruction only gave you the opportunity to do what you did?</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> The instruction was given to me and I reconciled myself with the instructions I received.</p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Just to link up with that question, this instruction that you have just testified about, this was in connection with your amnesty application, but you also testified that a long time before this operation, there were already talk of a revolution and war?</p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And you who worked very closely with Terreblanche, what was your opinion or your view with regards to the revolution and the war?</p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> For me in the run up to the election, it was implicitly shown by the media and also by certain ANC members that no Volkstaat ideology would realise and together with what Mr Terreblanche said, the fact that we do not negotiate with the ANC and that if they do not give what we want, we will make war, and we will use bomb explosions or firearms, or whatever, and I reconciled myself with that, that we were going to take up the struggle against the ANC and the National Party.</p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Were you prepared to make war?</p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> I was prepared to give my life for God, nation and father land.</p>
<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Let's look at your vehicle again, you testified that you were told by General Prinsloo to remove the tow bar from your vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Did you do it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> I did it, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Cliffie Barnard whom you also testified about, do you know which rank he held?</p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Cliffie was a Colonel at the AWB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> How did you view him as a member of the AWB, what was his relationship with the Staff Generals, do you know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> As far as the Staff Generals is concerned, I do not know, but it appeared to me that him and Terreblanche had a very good relationship and that he did certain things for Mr Terreblanche when they were having meetings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a>	When they were together in the office, nobody else was allowed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr De Wet, in the evidence of the previous applicants, there was evidence which indicated at some stage it was said that the ranks were going to be abandoned, or were abandoned.  Can you remember such evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you carry knowledge of that at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> I only went to Ventersdorp at a later stage, but Leon van der Merwe informed me that ranks would not exist because certain people were given instructions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When was this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line546"><a name="pos546"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> This was on the 21st or the 22nd, when I heard this from Van der Merwe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That is before the election, before there were talk of bombs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line548"><a name="pos548"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct Chairperson.  He told me it was war.</p>
<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The evidence which is aimed at trying to show that you reacted on the instructions of people who had rank, that is senseless because ranks no longer existed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No, ranks didn't exist, but in my eyes, he was still a General.  General Prinsloo and Leon van der Merwe, a Brigadier, and the instructions I received from them, my instructions, I got from them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But if you say there are no ranks any more, we are all equal, we are in battle, what is the worth of that evidence that you got instructions from a person with a certain rank?  I do not follow, please help me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a>	If there weren't any ranks, what is the worth of that type of evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> It is when we addressed each other in public, I would not say General can I talk to you Captain, or whatever, but in the inner circles it still existed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a>	We were together on the farm, and I spoke to someone, because I was brought up this way and also the fact that I did military service, I still used these ranks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Let me just take you back to Exhibit F Chairperson, just to link up with the fact that statements were made pertaining to the fact that you just acted.  This was put to the other applicants, you acted not on behalf of the AWB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a>	You testified that you were present at the meeting in Lichtenburg and you also saw the news report afterwards, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> It seems from the news report, the paper that the evening the hall was in darkness, do you know about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct Chairperson, because of the bomb explosion which took place earlier that day somewhere next to the road, Mr Terreblanche told us, he told the public there, that he apologises for there being no power, because they brought the generators to generate power and he asked the people to apologise for the noise, because there is no power because of bomb explosions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a>	Shortly after that he said that if the ANC and the National Party would not listen to our demand of a Volkstaat, there would be further bomb explosions, and these would be bigger than the ones already exploded.</p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Did you know who caused the bomb explosion at the power station?</p>
<p class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, I knew who were the two people involved in that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Who were they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> De Wet Ras and Breytenbach, they also applied for amnesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> You say De Wet Ras, there is a De Wet Strydom.</p>
<p class="line" id="line566"><a name="pos566"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> I apologise Chairperson, De Wet Strydom and Breytenbach were the two people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> The report goes further in the third paragraph, this is now Terreblanche speaking and the violence would not only take place within the Afrikaner area which they considered the Volkstaat, but also all over the country and then you would get nothing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line568"><a name="pos568"></a>	That is what he said addressing the ANC.  Do you have any comment on this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That was because of the utterances made by the ANC leaders.  The fact that they said one bullet, Kill a Boer, Kill a Farmer.  I think it was because of that, that if the ANC would not get anything out of this whole deal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line570"><a name="pos570"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> He goes further and he says at the meeting as well, that if they want the bombs to stop exploding, they must admit the nation's right which leads every nation to determine himself, with the right to self determination.</p>
<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a>	Ferdi Hartzenberg was also at the meeting, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct.  And if I can remember correctly, Constand Viljoen was also there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> It seems quite evident that he was adamant on a white election or referendum so that the will of the nation which is quoted, so that it could be demonstrated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes Chairperson, the Freedom Front, the AWB and the other right wing organisations, they often asked at these meetings that a white election could be held so that we can determine whether the whites wanted a general election or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> What was your idea, and this idea did the AWB have the same objective?  What would have happened if the election took place with regards to the ideal of the AWB to establish a Volkstaat?</p>
<p class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> If the elections took place, no regard would have been given to a Volkstaat for the white Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And he said that is why the AWB wanted to stop the election?</p>
<p class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Mr De Wet, did you gain any personal benefit from these deeds?</p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> None Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> What was your situation before this operation, you said you lost your job, but did you have ground on which you were farming?</p>
<p class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> After I worked for a while in the AWB, I started working for a private business.  I stayed on a farm on Ottosdal where I farmed.  When the Volkstaat became an ideal, we received the call up instructions, I lost all of that.  Today I've got nothing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Did you commit any of these deeds out of malice?</p>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No, I did not do it out of malice, I did it for the organisation, the AWB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line585"><a name="pos585"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> You did not testify about all of the meetings, but do you confirm the contents of your amnesty application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line586"><a name="pos586"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, I confirm it Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> No further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line588"><a name="pos588"></a><span class="speaker">NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS VAN DER WALT:</span> .</p>
<p class="line" id="line589"><a name="pos589"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR PRINSLOO:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.  Mr De Wet, you gave evidence that you and Mr Potgieter who were your co-accused, was this a person that was accused with you or was he a State witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> If I can remember correctly, he was at one stage charged, but he was only in prison for a while and then they used him as a State witness against us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Mr De Wet,  in Exhibit F that was shown to you it is also said that earlier the week Mr Terreblanche said that if the Afrikaners before the 27th of April get a Volkstaat or be added into the constitution, there will be no force big enough to stop them, that hell will break loose and that neither me or Ferdi Hartzenberg will be able to stop that.  How did you interpret that, you said that you did read the article?</p>
<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> For me it was a very real instruction, that we will fight this war if we did not get what we wanted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line593"><a name="pos593"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you understand out of this that these explosions would occur before the election?</p>
<p class="line" id="line594"><a name="pos594"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, before the election, with the election and I believe also after the elections, if the people were not arrested, there would be other bomb explosions and violence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> After the explosion at Bree Street, did you see it on TV at any stage during that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line596"><a name="pos596"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> The Bree Street explosion we saw the Sunday evening on the television.</p>
<p class="line" id="line597"><a name="pos597"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> What impression did it leave with you, what you saw?</p>
<p class="line" id="line598"><a name="pos598"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> The person who read the news that evening said that it, I am going to use my own words, it made a very big impression on the world because there is someone who would like to disrupt the election.</p>
<p class="line" id="line599"><a name="pos599"></a>	The media put it very clearly that someone wants to disrupt the election.</p>
<p class="line" id="line600"><a name="pos600"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you believe that those explosions would prevent the elections from continuing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line601"><a name="pos601"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, it was very clear that with such explosions, there would be no election.</p>
<p class="line" id="line602"><a name="pos602"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> With the explosions that occurred the next day, that is now the Monday, the 25th of April in Germiston and the pipe bombings, as well as an explosion in Pretoria, what was your impression or global expression regarding those explosions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line603"><a name="pos603"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That the chaos that would come from this, would disrupt the elections.</p>
<p class="line" id="line604"><a name="pos604"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Would it have any purpose if you allowed to when the election started, to only begin with your bombings on that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line605"><a name="pos605"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No, it was a struggle that began in the early 1990's.</p>
<p class="line" id="line606"><a name="pos606"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.</p>

<p class="line" id="line608"><a name="pos608"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR LANDMAN:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr De Wet, just referring to Exhibit F again, that is the newspaper article, the third paragraph on the left hand side.  The violence will not only take place in the area which the Afrikaners see as the Volkstaat, but across the whole country, and you will get bugger all or then you will get bugger all.  That is what he said of the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line609"><a name="pos609"></a>	What did he mean when he said that they would get bugger all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line610"><a name="pos610"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That the country will never belong to the ANC at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line611"><a name="pos611"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Would there by anything left of the country for the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line612"><a name="pos612"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, something would have been left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line613"><a name="pos613"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> What is "bugger-all" then?  What does that mean?</p>
<p class="line" id="line614"><a name="pos614"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> We would fight against the ANC, we would make war against them and that is the impression that I got from that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line615"><a name="pos615"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Sir, I put it to you it is clear here, what you are saying is that there will be violence everywhere, and there will be nothing left for the ANC, isn't that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line616"><a name="pos616"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is what it says yes, I saw it that there would be something left for a new beginning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line617"><a name="pos617"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How do you make that conclusion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line618"><a name="pos618"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Sir, I believe that you would have to plant a whole lot of bombs if you want to destroy the whole country in order for there to be nothing left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line619"><a name="pos619"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I know that is the practical conclusion of that, the question is how did you understand that sentence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line620"><a name="pos620"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> For me it was that nothing would be given to the ANC, we will fight for what is ours.  That is how I interpreted it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line621"><a name="pos621"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Sir, I want to put it to you that the other interpretation which is more clear, is that you will attempt to destroy everything, so that there will be nothing left?</p>
<p class="line" id="line622"><a name="pos622"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> I do not agree with that Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line623"><a name="pos623"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> That is why you planted all these highly damaging bombs that destroyed buildings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line624"><a name="pos624"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> The bombs that were planted in Johannesburg, it was only a small part that was destroyed and it was not the whole of Johannesburg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line625"><a name="pos625"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Mr De Wet, seeing the carnage caused by the Bree Street bomb on television on the Sunday night, did you think a few more of these big bombs would then bring an end to the election?</p>
<p class="line" id="line626"><a name="pos626"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, I believed that it was possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line627"><a name="pos627"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> And that is all that you wanted to do, was to stop the election?</p>
<p class="line" id="line628"><a name="pos628"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, to stop the election.</p>
<p class="line" id="line629"><a name="pos629"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> There was no need to throw pipe bombs, small pipe bombs at groups of people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line630"><a name="pos630"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Sir, I was not the planner of the pipe bombs, so I cannot say what the purpose was of them.  If it was also possibly to create further chaos.</p>
<p class="line" id="line631"><a name="pos631"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Did you participate in the throwing of the pipe bombs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line632"><a name="pos632"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Mr Chairman, I was not part of it but I was present when it was demonstrated and I transported it from Koesterfontein to the game farm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line633"><a name="pos633"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr De Wet, you gave evidence or testified as far as I remember that you reconciled yourself with the pipe bombs and that which was done with it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line634"><a name="pos634"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line635"><a name="pos635"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In the light of that, can you maybe answer again to the question that Mr Landman asked you about why pipe bombs were used?</p>
<p class="line" id="line636"><a name="pos636"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Mr Chairperson, all that I can add there is that that is to create further chaos in order to stop the election.  That is my personal opinion and that is how I saw it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line637"><a name="pos637"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It is not a question that you cannot answer the question because you did not do the planning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line638"><a name="pos638"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> I did not do any planning regarding the pipe bombs because I did reconcile myself with the group with whom I was at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line639"><a name="pos639"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Mr De Wet, when you drew up your application for amnesty, did you try to put in all the facts that you knew, that might be relevant to your application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line640"><a name="pos640"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Mr Chairperson, when my Advocates for Barnard, Le Roux and Myburgh was us in prison, we consulted together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line641"><a name="pos641"></a>	I gave them my version and asked the Advocates to submit my application as close as possible to what I have given them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line642"><a name="pos642"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Did you leave anything out of your application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line643"><a name="pos643"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Sir, if I can say the biggest detail is not included but the matter that it is about, does appear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line644"><a name="pos644"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Did you know that you were applying for amnesty for offences which you hadn't been convicted of?</p>
<p class="line" id="line645"><a name="pos645"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, Mr Chairperson, the day when I was sentenced in the High Court, the Judge I cannot remember his surname, the Judge said that I will be charged for everything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line646"><a name="pos646"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Did he say you were found guilty for everything?</p>
<p class="line" id="line647"><a name="pos647"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line648"><a name="pos648"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Are you guilty of the Bree Street bomb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line649"><a name="pos649"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line650"><a name="pos650"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> You had nothing to do with that?  You had nothing to do with planning it or committing that act at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line651"><a name="pos651"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No, I was not involved in the Bree Street bombing at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line652"><a name="pos652"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> You went to Ventersdorp in April in order to protect the borders of your Volkstaat?</p>
<p class="line" id="line653"><a name="pos653"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, he said Mr Landman that the only reason going to Ventersdorp was the intention of stopping the elections.</p>
<p class="line" id="line654"><a name="pos654"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Thank you, I apologise.</p>
<p class="line" id="line655"><a name="pos655"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It is different from the previous evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line656"><a name="pos656"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Thank you.  Mr De Wet, maybe you can tell us again, why did you go to Ventersdorp?</p>
<p class="line" id="line657"><a name="pos657"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Mr Chairperson, in Ventersdorp I worked there after I got a package at the mine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line658"><a name="pos658"></a>	There I started a guard unit in order to protect Mr Terreblanche and his family as well as the Staff Generals.  Afterwards I left Ventersdorp because of, in order to build myself financially.  I was called up to go to Ventersdorp and it was there that I could not attend the Trim Park meeting.  I gave evidence today, it was the 21st or the 22nd according to Brigadier Leon van der Merwe, where I received the instructions that were given at Trim Park, from him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line659"><a name="pos659"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> What instructions did you receive at the Trim Park, at Brigadier van der Merwe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line660"><a name="pos660"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Brigadier Van der Merwe, Johan Smit was there and it was told to me that it is war, that I must find a secure place where I could put my wife and children and later on, I will receive further instructions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line661"><a name="pos661"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you left your home and went to Ventersdorp, why did you go to Ventersdorp?</p>
<p class="line" id="line662"><a name="pos662"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> To go and hear what the instructions were that was given to the people at Trim Park.</p>
<p class="line" id="line663"><a name="pos663"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Mr De Wet, at the time you went to Ventersdorp, that day, you didn't know what the reason was for being called to Ventersdorp?</p>
<p class="line" id="line664"><a name="pos664"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No Mr Chairperson, I did not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line665"><a name="pos665"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> And you ended up going to the game farm where you actually did, you became a guard to guard the farm, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line666"><a name="pos666"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Mr Chairperson, the day when I went to Ventersdorp and met Brigadier Van der Merwe to hear what his instructions were, I went back to my home and from there I left with the women to the game farm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line667"><a name="pos667"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> And there you carried out guard duties?</p>
<p class="line" id="line668"><a name="pos668"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line669"><a name="pos669"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> And were you also not to protect the borders of the Volkstaat?</p>
<p class="line" id="line670"><a name="pos670"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No, the borders of the Volkstaat, there were other commando's in the area who did that.  My instruction there was that further instructions would be given to us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line671"><a name="pos671"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Mr De Wet, if I can just take you to something else.  The farm where you saw the gas cylinder bomb being built, was that Koesterfontein?</p>
<p class="line" id="line672"><a name="pos672"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, that is correct.  That was the farm of Abraham Myburgh's father.</p>
<p class="line" id="line673"><a name="pos673"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> So that bomb was built away from the main group of AWB supporters who were at the game farm at the time, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line674"><a name="pos674"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, it was away from the group that stayed at the game farm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line675"><a name="pos675"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> And only a very few people knew about that, the group of people who were on Koesterfontein?</p>
<p class="line" id="line676"><a name="pos676"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> At that stage yes, I understood it that way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line677"><a name="pos677"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> And we know that the Bree Street bomb was built there, at Koesterfontein, do you agree with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line678"><a name="pos678"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, it did come out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line679"><a name="pos679"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> The bomb for Germiston where you were involved, that was also built there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line680"><a name="pos680"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, it was also built at Koesterfontein.</p>
<p class="line" id="line681"><a name="pos681"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> The Jan Smuts bomb, where was that built?</p>
<p class="line" id="line682"><a name="pos682"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Out of the court case I understood that it was at the shooting range in Rustenburg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line683"><a name="pos683"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Would you agree with me Mr De Wet, that those people who moved to Ventersdorp and then later moved to the game farm, they were what one can describe at the "bitter einders"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line684"><a name="pos684"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No, Mr Chairperson, there were other AWB members of the AWB Wenkommando from the Western Transvaal, who also gathered there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line685"><a name="pos685"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Where were they, on whose farm were they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line686"><a name="pos686"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Sir, just outside Brits on Mr Manie Maritz' farm there were also people, between Mooinooi and Brits, there was also a farm.  I do not know who the owner was, there were also people.  Near Koster, it is a holiday resort, there were also people there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line687"><a name="pos687"></a>	On a farm near Ottosdal, I think it is Mr Koos Hough who was the owner of the farm, people were gathered there as well.  Also close to Klerksdorp people gathered.</p>
<p class="line" id="line688"><a name="pos688"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Mr De Wet, when did you for the first time think or realise that maybe some of these people at Koesterfontein were responsible for the Bree Street bomb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line689"><a name="pos689"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That evening, the Sunday evening when I arrived at Koesterfontein and I saw the gas bottle and explosives.</p>
<p class="line" id="line690"><a name="pos690"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> How well did you know Cliffie Barnard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line691"><a name="pos691"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> For the period when I was at Ventersdorp, worked there at the office, I knew him very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line692"><a name="pos692"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Have you had braais and brandy and Coke together?</p>
<p class="line" id="line693"><a name="pos693"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line694"><a name="pos694"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> What did you call him when you saw him at the AWB Headquarters?</p>
<p class="line" id="line695"><a name="pos695"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> I addressed him as Colonel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line696"><a name="pos696"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Did he object to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line697"><a name="pos697"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line698"><a name="pos698"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> He never said to you I don't want to be called by my rank?</p>
<p class="line" id="line699"><a name="pos699"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No Mr Chairperson, he never said that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line700"><a name="pos700"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Did other people also call him Colonel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line701"><a name="pos701"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes Mr Chairperson, Mr Terreblanche also called him that and Mr Prinsloo, and other people who also worked at Head Office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line702"><a name="pos702"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> From time to time did ordinary members of the AWB come to the Headquarters and speak to Mr Barnard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line703"><a name="pos703"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Mr Chairperson, the people from the area, the Western Transvaal district also came to the office and also addressed him as Colonel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line704"><a name="pos704"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Isn't it strange that Mr Le Roux and Mr Fourie didn't know and never referred to Mr Barnard as Colonel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line705"><a name="pos705"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Mr Chairperson, I cannot remember in that period when I worked at Ventersdorp that Mr Fourie or Mr Le Roux came to Ventersdorp at any stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line706"><a name="pos706"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Mr Fourie was an important man, he was one of the bodyguards of the leader, wasn't he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line707"><a name="pos707"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes Sir, that is true, but they worked in another district and when Mr Terreblanche let's say go to Johannesburg or Witwatersrand, then Barnard wasn't always with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line708"><a name="pos708"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> But he was at times with the leader in places like Johannesburg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line709"><a name="pos709"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, the times when he did drive with Mr Terreblanche, he did not wear his uniform.  I can concede to that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line710"><a name="pos710"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> So he normally wore a uniform at the office, at Headquarters?</p>
<p class="line" id="line711"><a name="pos711"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No Mr Chairperson, in the office he did not wear his uniform.  He did though, or let me put it this way, he was a Colonel and I can confirm that in parades that we attended and when he was on a horse, he had the uniform of a Colonel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line712"><a name="pos712"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Did he ever fall off?</p>
<p class="line" id="line713"><a name="pos713"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line714"><a name="pos714"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Mr De Wet, I want to put it to you that you fabricate and you are making this up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line715"><a name="pos715"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Mr Chairperson, that is what the Advocate says, my opinion is that it is the truth and that is how I knew Mr Barnard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line716"><a name="pos716"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Just as you made up the evidence about seeing this gas bottle bomb at Koesterfontein.</p>
<p class="line" id="line717"><a name="pos717"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No Mr Chairperson, I do not agree with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line718"><a name="pos718"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Did Mr Barnard ever give you any orders?</p>
<p class="line" id="line719"><a name="pos719"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line720"><a name="pos720"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Did anyone give you orders to plant bombs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line721"><a name="pos721"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line722"><a name="pos722"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Who was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line723"><a name="pos723"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Nico Prinsloo and Leon van der Merwe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line724"><a name="pos724"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Where is Nico Prinsloo today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line725"><a name="pos725"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> I do not know where he works at all Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line726"><a name="pos726"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Is he still a member of the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line727"><a name="pos727"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> I do not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line728"><a name="pos728"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Are you a member of the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line729"><a name="pos729"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> At this stage, no, not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line730"><a name="pos730"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Why not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line731"><a name="pos731"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> I am in prison and I do not mean anything for the AWB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line732"><a name="pos732"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Do you believe they have abandoned you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line733"><a name="pos733"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No, I would not say that they have abandoned me, there are some AWB members who still visit me in prison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line734"><a name="pos734"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Has the leader ever come to visit you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line735"><a name="pos735"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, he has.</p>
<p class="line" id="line736"><a name="pos736"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Has he ever admitted that the AWB was responsible for planting those bombs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line737"><a name="pos737"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, Mr Chairperson, in prison he at various times admitted that his Generals deserted him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line738"><a name="pos738"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Sir, that is not an answer to the question.  My question is did Mr Terreblanche say to you directly that he and the AWB is responsible for the bombs that were planted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line739"><a name="pos739"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line740"><a name="pos740"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Why did you never ask Mr Barnard whether he is the one who planted the bomb at Bree Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line741"><a name="pos741"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Mr Chairperson, I assumed that it was him and the group at Koesterfontein who made the bomb, I never asked him personally.</p>
<p class="line" id="line742"><a name="pos742"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> My question to you is why did you not ask him?  You know him well from Headquarters?</p>
<p class="line" id="line743"><a name="pos743"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> I did not ask him Chairperson.  I do not have a reason why I did not ask him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line744"><a name="pos744"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Because you never really knew who had planted that bomb, did you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line745"><a name="pos745"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> I knew who planted the bomb in Bree Street after I was at Koesterfontein.</p>
<p class="line" id="line746"><a name="pos746"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> You knew or you had a suspicion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line747"><a name="pos747"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> I had a very good suspicion from what I saw at Koesterfontein, and I accepted it was them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line748"><a name="pos748"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> But did you know whether Mr Barnard was acting on orders of the AWB or whether this was his own adventure?</p>
<p class="line" id="line749"><a name="pos749"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Mr Chairperson, I accepted that it was instructions from the AWB Head Office and that he wouldn't have done things on his own because General Nico Prinsloo and the people who were at the game farm, they knew about this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line750"><a name="pos750"></a>	Therefore I accepted that it carried the approval of the AWB, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line751"><a name="pos751"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> When on the game farm did somebody say that the AWB gave the order for the Bree Street bombing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line752"><a name="pos752"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> At the game farm those words were never spoken Chairperson, the fact that the AWB gave the instruction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line753"><a name="pos753"></a>	I accepted it because Nico Prinsloo and Leon van der Merwe was there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line754"><a name="pos754"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> But they weren't at Koesterfontein, were they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line755"><a name="pos755"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> They weren't there as far as I know Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line756"><a name="pos756"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> When you went back to the game farm, did you tell anybody that you had seen Barnard and others making a bomb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line757"><a name="pos757"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> I spoke to Nico Prinsloo about it Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line758"><a name="pos758"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Did you tell anybody else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line759"><a name="pos759"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Not that I can remember Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line760"><a name="pos760"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Why would you want to tell General Prinsloo about this bomb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line761"><a name="pos761"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Because I made my vehicle available to Prinsloo, I asked him about the vehicles that he promised Barnard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line762"><a name="pos762"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> But why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line763"><a name="pos763"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> I made mine available.  To me he was the General present there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line764"><a name="pos764"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> What was your motivation for telling him, just tell us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line765"><a name="pos765"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Please repeat?</p>
<p class="line" id="line766"><a name="pos766"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Why did you tell General Prinsloo about the bomb at Koesterfontein, what was your reason?</p>
<p class="line" id="line767"><a name="pos767"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Because I accepted that it was the AWB who was responsible for it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line768"><a name="pos768"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> But why tell him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line769"><a name="pos769"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Because we were busy with a freedom struggle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line770"><a name="pos770"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Why tell him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line771"><a name="pos771"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> He was there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line772"><a name="pos772"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Don't you think General Prinsloo would have known about it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line773"><a name="pos773"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Most probably yes, he would have known about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line774"><a name="pos774"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Why did you tell him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line775"><a name="pos775"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> I do not know Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line776"><a name="pos776"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Why didn't you tell the other people on the farm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line777"><a name="pos777"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> It was not an instruction that what you see and hear you should convey to other people, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line778"><a name="pos778"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Did Mr Barnard tell you that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line779"><a name="pos779"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line780"><a name="pos780"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr De Wet, after the bomb exploded, wasn't there talk at the base camp and said we succeeded, we made the bomb explode and the battle has started?</p>
<p class="line" id="line781"><a name="pos781"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> There was no question of talk about the Bree Street bomb, only talk about the  pipe bombs and the Germiston, only after that there were talk about the bombs at the base.  Before that, not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line782"><a name="pos782"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you whisper this or did you talk about it in the open?</p>
<p class="line" id="line783"><a name="pos783"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> After the Germiston bomb and the pipe bomb missions, we openly talked about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line784"><a name="pos784"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Mr De Wet, you say you saw on television that there had been a bomb in Bree Street, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line785"><a name="pos785"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line786"><a name="pos786"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Where was the television set?</p>
<p class="line" id="line787"><a name="pos787"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Inside the place where we lived Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line788"><a name="pos788"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Is that at the game farm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line789"><a name="pos789"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> At the game farm, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line790"><a name="pos790"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> What did the people say when they saw this on television?</p>
<p class="line" id="line791"><a name="pos791"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> The feeling was that the war had started.</p>
<p class="line" id="line792"><a name="pos792"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Was there any discussion about who might have been responsible?</p>
<p class="line" id="line793"><a name="pos793"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> We asked each other I wonder who did it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line794"><a name="pos794"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> But you knew by then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line795"><a name="pos795"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No, I did not know at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line796"><a name="pos796"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> When did you find out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line797"><a name="pos797"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Only the evening I went to Koesterfontein, then I assumed that it was them who were involved in this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line798"><a name="pos798"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> What time did you see the news, was it on television?</p>
<p class="line" id="line799"><a name="pos799"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, it was on television.  Seven o'clock or eight o'clock on television.</p>
<p class="line" id="line800"><a name="pos800"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Did you then go to Koesterfontein after that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line801"><a name="pos801"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> The evening if I remember correctly, between eight o'clock and ten o'clock, that is when I went to Koesterfontein.</p>
<p class="line" id="line802"><a name="pos802"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> You see it on television, you see people making a bomb at Koesterfontein, why didn't you ask Mr Barnard, the person you know well, do you know anything about that bomb in Bree Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line803"><a name="pos803"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> I did not ask questions at all and I cannot give a reason why I didn't ask questions either.</p>
<p class="line" id="line804"><a name="pos804"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Were you scared of Mr Barnard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line805"><a name="pos805"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line806"><a name="pos806"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Were you told at some stage that you must not ask questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line807"><a name="pos807"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Chairperson, when you are in a war situation, there are times when you do not ask questions, you just do as you are told.</p>
<p class="line" id="line808"><a name="pos808"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> But were you told not to ask questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line809"><a name="pos809"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> In the training that I have had, I was taught that Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line810"><a name="pos810"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> On the television, or rather let me ask you this, how many times did you see a report about the Bree Street bomb on Sunday night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line811"><a name="pos811"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Mr Chairperson, if I can remember correctly it was on the news twice, about seven/eight o'clock news and also later that evening, it was on CNN.</p>
<p class="line" id="line812"><a name="pos812"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Did you hear that night that the BKA accepted responsibility for the bomb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line813"><a name="pos813"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line814"><a name="pos814"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Did you know who the BKA were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line815"><a name="pos815"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line816"><a name="pos816"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Who were they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line817"><a name="pos817"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> It was an organisation of which Constand Viljoen was the leader and other right wing parties such as Mr  Terreblanche, Ferdi Hartzenberg, Agricultural Unions as well as the Mining Unions, they all belonged to it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line818"><a name="pos818"></a>	What the objective of the organisation was, I do not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line819"><a name="pos819"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Wasn't it meant to protect the farms, the farming areas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line820"><a name="pos820"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Please repeat?</p>
<p class="line" id="line821"><a name="pos821"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Was it not meant to protect the farms in the area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line822"><a name="pos822"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> I do not know if that was the purpose.</p>
<p class="line" id="line823"><a name="pos823"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Did you ever attend any meetings of the BKA?</p>
<p class="line" id="line824"><a name="pos824"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line825"><a name="pos825"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Did the BKA have its own constitution?</p>
<p class="line" id="line826"><a name="pos826"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> I do not know Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line827"><a name="pos827"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Did you ask anybody whether they knew what the BKA was doing, seeing that they have accepted responsibility for this bomb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line828"><a name="pos828"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No Mr Chairperson, I didn't ask anyone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line829"><a name="pos829"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> You have already mentioned another organisation called Boere Ordevolk, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line830"><a name="pos830"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line831"><a name="pos831"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Is it led by Mr Piet Rudolph?</p>
<p class="line" id="line832"><a name="pos832"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line833"><a name="pos833"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Does it have its own constitution?</p>
<p class="line" id="line834"><a name="pos834"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Certain points of his constitution is the same as the AWB, because we all wanted to get our own Volkstaat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line835"><a name="pos835"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> But it is a separate organisation from the AWB, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line836"><a name="pos836"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line837"><a name="pos837"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> The BKA was also separate from the AWB, wasn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line838"><a name="pos838"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> It had to be but it was still part of the AWB for me, because Terreblanche was involved with it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line839"><a name="pos839"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> All right.  Was the Freedom Front part of the Volksfront?</p>
<p class="line" id="line840"><a name="pos840"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Was the Freedom Front part of the Volksfront?</p>
<p class="line" id="line841"><a name="pos841"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line842"><a name="pos842"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No Mr Chairperson, it was a group that splintered away from the Volksfront.</p>
<p class="line" id="line843"><a name="pos843"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> So are you saying that when the BKA commits an act, it is actually the AWB who is committing that act?</p>
<p class="line" id="line844"><a name="pos844"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No Chairperson, I do not say that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line845"><a name="pos845"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Is it not possible Mr De Wet, that Mr Barnard could have been a member of the BKA?</p>
<p class="line" id="line846"><a name="pos846"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> It is possible Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line847"><a name="pos847"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Likewise Mr Le Roux, Ettiene le Roux?</p>
<p class="line" id="line848"><a name="pos848"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> It is possible Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line849"><a name="pos849"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> And this might have been a small cell of people at Koesterfontein making bombs on behalf of BKA?</p>
<p class="line" id="line850"><a name="pos850"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> If you make the statement that way, I must accept that all the Officers who were at the game farm, must also have been part of the BKA.</p>
<p class="line" id="line851"><a name="pos851"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> It is possible, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line852"><a name="pos852"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> It is possible Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line853"><a name="pos853"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> This may have nothing to do with the AWB at all, this bombing campaign?</p>
<p class="line" id="line854"><a name="pos854"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No, I wouldn't say that because all of us who were there, we gathered together there for the AWB, we did not belong to any other organisations, I didn't belong to other organisations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line855"><a name="pos855"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> You can only talk for yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line856"><a name="pos856"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line857"><a name="pos857"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Assuming it was the BKA who planted that bomb in Bree Street, do you associate yourself with what the BKA did?</p>
<p class="line" id="line858"><a name="pos858"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line859"><a name="pos859"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> I understand that your amnesty application is based on a belief that that bomb was planted in support of the AWB's political struggle, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line860"><a name="pos860"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line861"><a name="pos861"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Do you know what struggle the BKA was involved in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line862"><a name="pos862"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line863"><a name="pos863"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Mr De Wet, at the time that you went to Ventersdorp to find out what the instructions were, did you at that stage have any idea as to whether or not you would get a Volkstaat, did you believe that there was still a chance that that might happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line864"><a name="pos864"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Chairperson, if you looked at the politics at that stage, the chances for us to obtain a Volkstaat, was impossible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line865"><a name="pos865"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Mr De Wet, so did you understand at that stage that the only way to get a Volkstaat, was by way of violence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line866"><a name="pos866"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No Chairperson, to wage a war.</p>
<p class="line" id="line867"><a name="pos867"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> What form would this war take?</p>
<p class="line" id="line868"><a name="pos868"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> By planting bombs, by taking up weapon and to shoot for what you want.</p>
<p class="line" id="line869"><a name="pos869"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> In connection with the Germiston bomb, what was the motive behind planting that particular bomb in that area where it was planted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line870"><a name="pos870"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> To stop the election and to stop chaos.</p>
<p class="line" id="line871"><a name="pos871"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> What would you achieve by stopping the election?</p>
<p class="line" id="line872"><a name="pos872"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Then there would have been further negotiations with the National Party for a Volkstaat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line873"><a name="pos873"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> But you knew by that stage that you weren't going to get one, were you not convinced that no matter what you did ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line874"><a name="pos874"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> You asked me what we wanted to achieve by it and I told you what we wanted to achieve.</p>
<p class="line" id="line875"><a name="pos875"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Mr De Wet, let me ask you this.  By the time you planted that first bomb, did you believe that you could stop the election?</p>
<p class="line" id="line876"><a name="pos876"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line877"><a name="pos877"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Did you want people to rise up and oppose the government?</p>
<p class="line" id="line878"><a name="pos878"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line879"><a name="pos879"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> How was that going to come about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line880"><a name="pos880"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Because of the chaos in the country and the bomb explosions and the people who do not go to the voting polls Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line881"><a name="pos881"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When people were arrested, the people at the shooting range, or wherever, did you then think that the election could still be stopped?</p>
<p class="line" id="line882"><a name="pos882"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No Chairperson, the arrests which took place made or ensured that the elections would be successful.</p>
<p class="line" id="line883"><a name="pos883"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But did you realise that the elections could not be stopped when the arrests were made?</p>
<p class="line" id="line884"><a name="pos884"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Chairperson, if they weren't all arrested at the shooting range, the group who was involved, there would still have been acts committed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line885"><a name="pos885"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But the question is, you heard the people were arrested at the shooting range, did you then realise that the election cannot be stopped?</p>
<p class="line" id="line886"><a name="pos886"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No Chairperson, I did not realise it then because I still believed that the other people who were still in the area in the Western Transvaal, that their actions or plans would also help.</p>
<p class="line" id="line887"><a name="pos887"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When did you realise that the elections could not be stopped?</p>
<p class="line" id="line888"><a name="pos888"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> After the election took place and nothing else happened Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line889"><a name="pos889"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Mr De Wet, getting back to what we were dealing with, if the elections didn't take place, who would revolt, who would take part in this revolution, would it be black people who would be revolting so that they can ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line890"><a name="pos890"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No Chairperson, it would have been the people who reconciled themselves with the Volkstaat idea.</p>
<p class="line" id="line891"><a name="pos891"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> How were they going to revolt, can you describe what you anticipated would happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line892"><a name="pos892"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Chairperson, because bombs were already exploding before the elections and at meetings and marches which were held in towns, I believed by means of that, people would have started revolting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line893"><a name="pos893"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> So people would be leaving their houses in Primrose and in Homestead in Germiston after this bomb, and because they can't vote, and what would they be doing in the streets?</p>
<p class="line" id="line894"><a name="pos894"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is how I saw it Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line895"><a name="pos895"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> What will they be doing, what will they do?  Will they march up and down the streets?</p>
<p class="line" id="line896"><a name="pos896"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Submissions would have been made to the government of the day and I believe if a bomb exploded, Terreblanche would have said to the government, if you do not listen to us, there will be another bomb, and there will be a bigger one and that is how I saw it at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line897"><a name="pos897"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Is this something which you understood from Mr Terreblanche's statements that this is what he intended doing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line898"><a name="pos898"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, with his speeches he made on stage, this is how I understood it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line899"><a name="pos899"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> For how many years were you Mr Terreblanche's bodyguard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line900"><a name="pos900"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> For the six months that I was in Ventersdorp I was personal bodyguard, and I accompanied him everywhere.</p>
<p class="line" id="line901"><a name="pos901"></a>	In the Ystergarde you are both a bodyguard and instructor and when I was in his area, I would have been his bodyguard.  That is in the six months that I was in Ventersdorp.</p>
<p class="line" id="line902"><a name="pos902"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> When did you first attend a meeting addressed by Mr Terreblanche, was it years ago?</p>
<p class="line" id="line903"><a name="pos903"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> From the very first meeting I can remember was in the early 1980's, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line904"><a name="pos904"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Was he then talking about war?</p>
<p class="line" id="line905"><a name="pos905"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line906"><a name="pos906"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> That was at the time of P.W. Botha?</p>
<p class="line" id="line907"><a name="pos907"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> It was still in P.W. Botha's time, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line908"><a name="pos908"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> And then when Frederick took over, he then also talked about war against Mr De Klerk?</p>
<p class="line" id="line909"><a name="pos909"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line910"><a name="pos910"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Mr Terreblanche just talks about war all the time, doesn't he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line911"><a name="pos911"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line912"><a name="pos912"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> It is a lot of hot air, isn't it, this war that he keeps talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line913"><a name="pos913"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> In his speeches people got whipped up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line914"><a name="pos914"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Mr De Wet, you are obviously an intelligent person, didn't you understand that this is a man who talks about war ten years ago and ten years on, he is still talking about this war that never takes place?  Isn't that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line915"><a name="pos915"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is so Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line916"><a name="pos916"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> You didn't believe him when he spoke about war, did you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line917"><a name="pos917"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> I believed that there would be a revolution, I believed that there would be a war Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line918"><a name="pos918"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> The best that he ever did, the best attempt that he ever had at war was going to Bophuthatswana on the back of bakkies and shooting at people there, isn't that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line919"><a name="pos919"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> I cannot give comment on that Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line920"><a name="pos920"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> But you know about that incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line921"><a name="pos921"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, I carry knowledge of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line922"><a name="pos922"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> You know that he was eventually chased out there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line923"><a name="pos923"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> I do not know the circumstances that well, I do not want to testify to that Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line924"><a name="pos924"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> I want to understand how you felt.  This Bophuthatswana business happened in about February 1994, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line925"><a name="pos925"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Can you repeat the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line926"><a name="pos926"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> The so-called invasion into Bophuthatswana happened in about February 1994?</p>
<p class="line" id="line927"><a name="pos927"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line928"><a name="pos928"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Weren't you working full-time for Mr Terreblanche at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line929"><a name="pos929"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line930"><a name="pos930"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> What did you think of that invasion, did you think it was a success?</p>
<p class="line" id="line931"><a name="pos931"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Sir, what I saw in TV, I can't say it was a success.</p>
<p class="line" id="line932"><a name="pos932"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Did you after that, could you have faith in Mr Terreblanche and his organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line933"><a name="pos933"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes Mr Chairperson, because what happened in Bophuthatswana was not the AWB's goal or purpose, they had their own Volkstaat and Mr Mangope wanted to help them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line934"><a name="pos934"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Surely Mr De Wet, as an intelligent person, you could see that Mr Terreblanche was full of hot air and nothing more?  He never came to visit you at the game farm, did he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line935"><a name="pos935"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is true, I also did not expect him to come and visit us because he had other tasks to do and other duties to do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line936"><a name="pos936"></a>	The Generals were there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line937"><a name="pos937"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Do you know  of any other duties he performed in furtherance of this war, the revolution?</p>
<p class="line" id="line938"><a name="pos938"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, Mr Chairperson.  At meetings he addressed the people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line939"><a name="pos939"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> This is the same speeches he was giving when P.W. Botha was in power, isn't that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line940"><a name="pos940"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line941"><a name="pos941"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Isn't it so Mr De Wet, that ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line942"><a name="pos942"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Landman, without wanting to stop you, last week we called Mr Fourie out of order in an attempt as I understood, to cut down lengthy cross-examination unnecessary.  I am not saying your cross-examination is unnecessary, but where are we getting to with this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line943"><a name="pos943"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, if I can just move on to the next point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line944"><a name="pos944"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I am making the point that each representative was going to deal with an incident and if he wasn't representing anybody who was interested in a particular incident, he would just go by.</p>
<p class="line" id="line945"><a name="pos945"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line946"><a name="pos946"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I don't know, maybe I misunderstood the whole plan.</p>
<p class="line" id="line947"><a name="pos947"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, it became quite difficult to do it on that basis, but I am not going to be much longer with this witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line948"><a name="pos948"></a>	The thing is he said he associated himself with the Bree Street bomb, I am not quite sure whether that entitles him to amnesty or not, but that is an issue for the Committee at a later stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line949"><a name="pos949"></a>	I have just one last aspect.  Mr De Wet, do you know of an organisation or a philosophy called the Israeli Vision?</p>
<p class="line" id="line950"><a name="pos950"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line951"><a name="pos951"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Were you part of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line952"><a name="pos952"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line953"><a name="pos953"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Mr Chairperson, with respect, you just made mention about cross-examination, but what has the Israeli Vision got to do with all the application?  Because in all the applications they say that they did it out of some religious stand point, if it was the Israeli Vision or any other church.</p>
<p class="line" id="line954"><a name="pos954"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I am not saying that the question cannot be asked, it could have been a relevant question, I do not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line955"><a name="pos955"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Then the relevance must be indicated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line956"><a name="pos956"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He says no, so ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line957"><a name="pos957"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Mr Chairman, I take the point.  He said no, and I am not going to take it any further.  I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line958"><a name="pos958"></a><span class="speaker">NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR LANDMAN:</span> .</p>
<p class="line" id="line959"><a name="pos959"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR KRIEL:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.  I will get a word in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line960"><a name="pos960"></a>	Mr De Wet, just a few aspects.  How far did you get in school?</p>
<p class="line" id="line961"><a name="pos961"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> I beg your pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line962"><a name="pos962"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> How far did you get in school?</p>
<p class="line" id="line963"><a name="pos963"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> I've got matric and I qualified myself in N6.</p>
<p class="line" id="line964"><a name="pos964"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I am sorry, I did not hear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line965"><a name="pos965"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Mr Chairperson, I qualified matric and after school I qualified with an N6 certificate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line966"><a name="pos966"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> Thank you.  You say that you were at the mine just before you took a package.  What type of work did you do at the mines?</p>
<p class="line" id="line967"><a name="pos967"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> I was an electrician.</p>
<p class="line" id="line968"><a name="pos968"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> Did you know anything about explosives?</p>
<p class="line" id="line969"><a name="pos969"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line970"><a name="pos970"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> Did you deal with any explosives?</p>
<p class="line" id="line971"><a name="pos971"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No, at the mine where I worked I only saw some of the explosives around there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line972"><a name="pos972"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> Did you know about the dangers of explosives?</p>
<p class="line" id="line973"><a name="pos973"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line974"><a name="pos974"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> Koper Myburgh, what rank did he have within the Ystergarde?</p>
<p class="line" id="line975"><a name="pos975"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> In the Ystergarde, if I can remember correctly, he was a Lieutenant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line976"><a name="pos976"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> So you had a higher rank than him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line977"><a name="pos977"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, that is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line978"><a name="pos978"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> Was it Koper Myburgh who arrived at the game farm and specifically asked for you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line979"><a name="pos979"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line980"><a name="pos980"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> If you will just give me a moment Mr Chairperson.  You see paragraph 17, page 77 you say specifically on the 23rd of April, Koper Myburgh arrived at the game farm and he asked me to go to his father's farm in Koesterfontein?</p>
<p class="line" id="line981"><a name="pos981"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That was after I was called into the meeting where they asked me if I wanted to join him in going to Koesterfontein.  Maybe I did not put it correctly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line982"><a name="pos982"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> So it was not Koper Myburgh who requested you specifically?</p>
<p class="line" id="line983"><a name="pos983"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No, they asked me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line984"><a name="pos984"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> This war to which you at various times refer to, when would this have started?</p>
<p class="line" id="line985"><a name="pos985"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Sir, when we gathered at the game farm, after we left the women, we accepted that the war started.</p>
<p class="line" id="line986"><a name="pos986"></a>	When I arrived at Leon van der Merwe, he said it was war now, it was the 21st and the 22nd of April.</p>
<p class="line" id="line987"><a name="pos987"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> So before that there was no war?</p>
<p class="line" id="line988"><a name="pos988"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No, there was a run up to the revolution, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line989"><a name="pos989"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> The war started on the 21st/22nd and not before that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line990"><a name="pos990"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No, not before that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line991"><a name="pos991"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> You said that you are willing to give you life?</p>
<p class="line" id="line992"><a name="pos992"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line993"><a name="pos993"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> For that which you believed in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line994"><a name="pos994"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> For God, country and nation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line995"><a name="pos995"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> That is now the third time that you use those words, but you are not willing to give your vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line996"><a name="pos996"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> I made my vehicle available.</p>
<p class="line" id="line997"><a name="pos997"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> No Sir, you made it conditionally available.</p>
<p class="line" id="line998"><a name="pos998"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> If I am not the driver, I will not give my vehicle, because I do not know what they will use my vehicle for.</p>
<p class="line" id="line999"><a name="pos999"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> But you will give your life?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1000"><a name="pos1000"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, I would.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1001"><a name="pos1001"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> This coalition that you refer to in paragraph 7 of your application, this Afrikaans Volksfront, if I may use the word, is that the vehicle of Constand Viljoen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1002"><a name="pos1002"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Please repeat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1003"><a name="pos1003"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> This Afrikaner Volksfront in paragraph 7, was this the party or Constand Viljoen, was he part of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1004"><a name="pos1004"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, he was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1005"><a name="pos1005"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> And I accept that you believed that with General Constand Viljoen's people you would have been able to succeed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1006"><a name="pos1006"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1007"><a name="pos1007"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> If I understand Constand Viljoen correctly, he said that he will take part in the elections at about the 12th of March 1994?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1008"><a name="pos1008"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He made the decision at that time, he took part in the election on the 27th of April?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1009"><a name="pos1009"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> Yes, I accept that but on the 12th of March he said I will not go into a war, but I will take part in the election, is that correct if I put it that way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1010"><a name="pos1010"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> I agree, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1011"><a name="pos1011"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> That was already the 12th of March when Viljoen decided not to take part in the war?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1012"><a name="pos1012"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> I do not know if he decided that completely, I cannot answer for him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1013"><a name="pos1013"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> But Sir, it was very clear, there were boards up various parties that would take part and amongst them, Viljoen's party of the Freedom Front was also up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1014"><a name="pos1014"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Chairperson, when we gathered in Pretoria, all the right wing people said that we will not vote and I believed that Mr Constand Viljoen would also not vote because he was part of the meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1015"><a name="pos1015"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you know that he was going to take part in the elections?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1016"><a name="pos1016"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> He talked about him taking part in the elections, but what was said there at the meeting, this is my personal opinion, at that stage that he had a hidden agenda with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1017"><a name="pos1017"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When did you find out that he was going to take part in the elections?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1018"><a name="pos1018"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> I cannot say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1019"><a name="pos1019"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was it before the march up or after?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1020"><a name="pos1020"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> I would say it was before the march to Ventersdorp, when the people were called up to go there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1021"><a name="pos1021"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> You accept that approximately the 12th of March Viljoen would have decided to take part in the election?  When was the meeting in the Skilpad Hall?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1022"><a name="pos1022"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That was in January/February 1994.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1023"><a name="pos1023"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> So the talk about war was before the 12th of March?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1024"><a name="pos1024"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Mr Chairperson, as I said already the run up to the election, things took place before that and talk about war, occurred before that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1025"><a name="pos1025"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> But the person who would give you the most support, withdrew?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1026"><a name="pos1026"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> It was not the impression that I got, that he would completely withdraw.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1027"><a name="pos1027"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> In other words in the Western Transvaal, Constand Viljoen did not tie any placard against a pole for the election?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1028"><a name="pos1028"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> For me it was a set, a plan, it was a hidden agenda.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1029"><a name="pos1029"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> If I understand Mr Fourie correctly on Friday, you went to the game farm in order to protect the borders of the Volkstaat, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1030"><a name="pos1030"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes Mr Chairperson, that is how he gave evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1031"><a name="pos1031"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> Do you agree with what he testified?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1032"><a name="pos1032"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No, I do not agree with him.  There are certain things I do not agree with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1033"><a name="pos1033"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> So why did you go to the game farm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1034"><a name="pos1034"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Because they told me that it is a war and you do not only protect the Western Transvaal's borders, you protect the whole country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1035"><a name="pos1035"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr De Wet, surely on the 27th of April 1994 it was then not a set or a plan, you had to realise that they were going to take part in the elections?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1036"><a name="pos1036"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1037"><a name="pos1037"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When did you realise that he is telling the truth, that he is going to take part in the elections?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1038"><a name="pos1038"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Sir, I cannot say when I realised this, but it was after I was arrested that I realised that Mr Constand Viljoen did take part in the elections.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1039"><a name="pos1039"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When were you arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1040"><a name="pos1040"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> It was two, three months after the 27th.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1041"><a name="pos1041"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But on the 27th you had to have realised that he is taking part in the elections?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1042"><a name="pos1042"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Mr Chairperson, on the 27th, when they arrested the people at the shooting range, I started fleeing, I was on the run because our people were arrested.  For a few days I did not watch the news, I cannot say what happened there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1043"><a name="pos1043"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> Just to follow up on the question of the Chairperson.  During the period of the 12th of March up to the elections, did you have a television in your house, did you buy a newspaper?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1044"><a name="pos1044"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No Mr Chairperson, I did not have a television and I was also not a person who read newspapers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1045"><a name="pos1045"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> Were you also part of the HNP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1046"><a name="pos1046"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1047"><a name="pos1047"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> You say that the war was declared around the 21st or the 22nd of April 1994?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1048"><a name="pos1048"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, they said that we are going to make war.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1049"><a name="pos1049"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> Who chose the target in Germiston?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1050"><a name="pos1050"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> I do not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1051"><a name="pos1051"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> Did you discuss it at any time with your fellow men?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1052"><a name="pos1052"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No, I was only at Koesterfontein the evening, and the next afternoon ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1053"><a name="pos1053"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> Did you ever discuss things or talked to each other at Koesterfontein?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1054"><a name="pos1054"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> I was not at Koesterfontein, I only went to go and drop off the pipe bombs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1055"><a name="pos1055"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> And then you went back the next morning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1056"><a name="pos1056"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, to go and get the trailer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1057"><a name="pos1057"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> And didn't you talk with your fellow soldiers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1058"><a name="pos1058"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No, the morning we got the instructions that this is going to Germiston and how we must transport this trailer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1059"><a name="pos1059"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> Sir, did you see the bomb in the trailer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1060"><a name="pos1060"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1061"><a name="pos1061"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> At what stage did you see the gas burner?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1062"><a name="pos1062"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> The evening when I was at Koesterfontein, it was on a table and explosives were stuck around it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1063"><a name="pos1063"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> The next morning, where was that explosive and gas bottle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1064"><a name="pos1064"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> I do not know, I was not in the building again.  I got Mr Le Roux's vehicle with a trailer along the road.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1065"><a name="pos1065"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> Are you saying now that you did not know what was in the trailer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1066"><a name="pos1066"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> They said there to me that the bomb was in the trailer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1067"><a name="pos1067"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> And didn't you receive any further instructions to put sand in the trailer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1068"><a name="pos1068"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Before I got there, they were busy to load sand into the trailer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1069"><a name="pos1069"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> How do you know that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1070"><a name="pos1070"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Because I saw it Mr Chairman,  when I got there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1071"><a name="pos1071"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> In other words, you did see the trailer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1072"><a name="pos1072"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1073"><a name="pos1073"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> What did you see?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1074"><a name="pos1074"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> There was sand on top of the gas bottle, I did not see it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1075"><a name="pos1075"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> Did you see the sand?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1076"><a name="pos1076"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1077"><a name="pos1077"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Inside the trailer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1078"><a name="pos1078"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, inside the trailer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1079"><a name="pos1079"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was it only sand that you saw inside the trailer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1080"><a name="pos1080"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> I only saw the sand, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1081"><a name="pos1081"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> What type of bomb would you take to Germiston?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1082"><a name="pos1082"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> I accepted that it was the gas bottle bomb.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1083"><a name="pos1083"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> So you knew how big that bomb would be?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1084"><a name="pos1084"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1085"><a name="pos1085"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> Was the trailer not full?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1086"><a name="pos1086"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, it was full of soil.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1087"><a name="pos1087"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> Sir, what I cannot understand is why did four of you have to drive through?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1088"><a name="pos1088"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> I was the driver of my vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1089"><a name="pos1089"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> That is acceptable.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1090"><a name="pos1090"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> And the person who drove with me, had to detonate the bomb.  The vehicle in front could have one or two, it would be the guide vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1091"><a name="pos1091"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> Why did that vehicle have to have two people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1092"><a name="pos1092"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> It could have been one, I do not know why there were two.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1093"><a name="pos1093"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> Did you see what damage that Germiston bomb did?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1094"><a name="pos1094"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Only that which I saw on television, and also the photographs that were at the court case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1095"><a name="pos1095"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> So you saw what damage that bomb did?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1096"><a name="pos1096"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1097"><a name="pos1097"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> When you unhooked the trailer, who were with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1098"><a name="pos1098"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Mr Johan Vlok.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1099"><a name="pos1099"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> Did you not at that stage tell Vlok that we are now at a taxi rank, we must not detonate the bomb here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1100"><a name="pos1100"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No, I did not say that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1101"><a name="pos1101"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> Were you happy with the choice of the target?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1102"><a name="pos1102"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> We were told that they will tell us where we must detonate the bomb, and I kept with the order that was given.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1103"><a name="pos1103"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> You just executed the orders?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1104"><a name="pos1104"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> The only difference was that the vehicle said that the bomb must be detonated here, all that I did was drove around the block and parked in the parking lot, and that was the order.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1105"><a name="pos1105"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> And there were a lot of people and taxi's?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1106"><a name="pos1106"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, there were taxi's.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1107"><a name="pos1107"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> Not a lot of people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1108"><a name="pos1108"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1109"><a name="pos1109"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> Do you know how many people were killed in the Germiston bombing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1110"><a name="pos1110"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> They talk about 10 people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1111"><a name="pos1111"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> And in the court case, did you find out how big that bomb was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1112"><a name="pos1112"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> They talked about 100 kilograms, if I can remember correctly, 100 kilograms of explosives.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1113"><a name="pos1113"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> 100 Kilograms of explosives?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1114"><a name="pos1114"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, they said the bomb was 100 kilograms.  I do not know what they meant by 100 kilograms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1115"><a name="pos1115"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> Did you realise how big that bomb was that bodies were thrown up to the ten storey building?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1116"><a name="pos1116"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes Mr Chairperson, I heard that in the court case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1117"><a name="pos1117"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> Sir, your application in the AWB, you said that you have to be an Afrikaner and a Christian?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1118"><a name="pos1118"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1119"><a name="pos1119"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> Was that the action of an Afrikaner and a Christian?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1120"><a name="pos1120"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, Mr Chairperson, I was in a war situation and everything that I had to achieve, I see that as a Christian way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1121"><a name="pos1121"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> In other words that bomb is within that parameter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1122"><a name="pos1122"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, that is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1123"><a name="pos1123"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> You said earlier on to Mr Landman, that you are currently not a member of the AWB because you are of no use to them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1124"><a name="pos1124"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1125"><a name="pos1125"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> And if you do get amnesty, will you again join the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1126"><a name="pos1126"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Sir, at this stage I do not want to involve myself with any politics, I just want to continue with my life.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1127"><a name="pos1127"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1128"><a name="pos1128"></a><span class="speaker">NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR KRIEL:</span> .</p>
<p class="line" id="line1129"><a name="pos1129"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR SINJATSI:</span> Sir, listening to you I must at the outset tell you that, I am asking myself if you are telling us the whole truth as you know it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1130"><a name="pos1130"></a>	Tell me Sir, ordinarily who do you expect to get the instructions from if you go out on any operation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1131"><a name="pos1131"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Mr Chairperson, that it would carry the approval of the leader of the AWB and Staff Generals and the Officers above me, it should carry their approval.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1132"><a name="pos1132"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINJATSI:</span> And Sir, is it correct that as a trained soldier you expected things to be done in an orderly fashion, you knew that if actions are to be carried out, there will be specific cells or groups for that purpose and things would be done in an orderly fashion, didn't you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1133"><a name="pos1133"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1134"><a name="pos1134"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINJATSI:</span> Now, talking about the Germiston bomb, did you belong to any cell or any group that was responsible for any operations?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1135"><a name="pos1135"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> I belonged to the AWB at that stage Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1136"><a name="pos1136"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINJATSI:</span> Sir, the impression I have is that even within the AWB and further within the Ystergarde, somebody seems to have been appointed at some stage, to be in charge of the operations unit, is that impression correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1137"><a name="pos1137"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct Chairperson, there were people who were appointed to do certain tasks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1138"><a name="pos1138"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINJATSI:</span> Now my question to you is, did you belong to any of these special operation units?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1139"><a name="pos1139"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No Mr Chairperson, I was only a member of the group who gathered together at the game farm and part of the bomb missions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1140"><a name="pos1140"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINJATSI:</span> And just to understand you further, are you saying that as far as the Germiston bomb is concerned, it was by mere chance, you collided into it, you didn't know about its planning, hardly did you know that it was going to be there in the first place, you just happened to be called there to make your motor vehicle available and there you were, finding yourself in Germiston on such a big mission?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1141"><a name="pos1141"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct Chairperson, of the planning of that bomb, I knew nothing.  Koekemoer who was involved in court, he testified that I helped building the bomb, but that is a lie, I did not help in building the bomb at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1142"><a name="pos1142"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> On the way to Germiston, did you know what you were transporting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1143"><a name="pos1143"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, I was told it was going to be a bomb which should be planted in Germiston.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1144"><a name="pos1144"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINJATSI:</span> Sir, you say that when you were in Germiston, you realised that this was a black taxi rank?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1145"><a name="pos1145"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Chairperson, all that I saw when I arrived in Germiston was that it was a taxi stand and that there were buildings around it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1146"><a name="pos1146"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINJATSI:</span> Is it then your evidence that you didn't know that this was a black taxi rank?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1147"><a name="pos1147"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No Chairperson, there were black people, I can tell you that.  I do not know if there were other people, there were whites present as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1148"><a name="pos1148"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINJATSI:</span> Okay, talking about the war and be mindful of the fact that you are a trained soldier.  Did you have any targets in your war?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1149"><a name="pos1149"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No Chairperson, we did not have specific targets.  I wasn't told that we had specific targets.  The fact was that the elections had to be stopped at all costs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1150"><a name="pos1150"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINJATSI:</span> Talking about the bombs that came before you could move over to Ventersdorp and therefore let's say, talk about the bomb on the 23rd/24th, before then, the other bombs that had gone off, were you aware of what the policy of the AWB was regarding the planing of these bombs, with particular reference to who would be the target?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1151"><a name="pos1151"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Chairperson, what I did know was that the targets which were pointed out at that stage, was NP offices as well as ANC offices.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1152"><a name="pos1152"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINJATSI:</span> It seems to me Sir, correct me if I am wrong, going by the report that has been distributed here where Mr Terreblanche was talking about more bombs are coming, if one looks at that report, it seems to me that even if one was to talk about the bombs in Lichtenburg and Leeudoringstad, these were directed at specific targets like an electrical pylon apparently and Leeudoring one, directed at the railway line.  Isn't it that you had a specific pattern of going about identifying your targets as the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1153"><a name="pos1153"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Chairperson, what the planning was, I do not know.  I do not know if they had deliberate targets, but what I did know was that NP and ANC offices were bombed at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1154"><a name="pos1154"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINJATSI:</span> Let me put it differently, up to the time that you moved over to Ventersdorp, the impression I have here, and please tell me if this is not also  your impression, is that you were targeting things like offices, power stations, railway lines, government things or political things if one may put it in those terms, is that impression correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1155"><a name="pos1155"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1156"><a name="pos1156"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINJATSI:</span> And Sir, all the meetings that you attended, where Mr Terreblanche amongst others talked, did any of them say to you that there is now a change in the attitude of the choice of targets?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1157"><a name="pos1157"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No Mr Chairperson, it was never put to me in that way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1158"><a name="pos1158"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINJATSI:</span> In fact nobody ever said to you that now it is time that innocent civilians must be killed otherwise you would have long told us about it?  Did anybody say that to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1159"><a name="pos1159"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No Chairperson, nobody told me to go and kill innocent people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1160"><a name="pos1160"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINJATSI:</span> And Sir, as a trained soldier, I think it is pretty obvious to you that when you are involved in a war situation, you don't go about killing innocent civilians, am I correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1161"><a name="pos1161"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Mr Chairperson, what I learnt from waging a war is that innocent people too die in a war situation - people who are not interested in politics.  It doesn't matter what country's war this is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1162"><a name="pos1162"></a>	Innocent people do get killed.  But nobody actually told me to go and kill innocent people, those were just the circumstances.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1163"><a name="pos1163"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINJATSI:</span> Yes.  If innocent civilians get caught in the cross-fire, it seems to me that that is unfortunate, but they are not really the target, isn't that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1164"><a name="pos1164"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No Mr Chairperson, they are not the target but they were there by coincidence, caught up in the cross-fire.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1165"><a name="pos1165"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINJATSI:</span> Let's talk now about the Germiston bomb.  Who was the target?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1166"><a name="pos1166"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Mr Chairperson, I do not know of any target, I was only told to go and plant the bomb there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1167"><a name="pos1167"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINJATSI:</span> By the way, why do you say you moved to Ventersdorp, I understand it was a call up, but what was your understanding, why did you have to move to Ventersdorp?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1168"><a name="pos1168"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Mr Chairperson, the first time I went there was when I went to work there, I took a package from my job, otherwise I would have lost it because of Affirmative Action.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1169"><a name="pos1169"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINJATSI:</span> No, I mean around the 20th or 21st of April?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1170"><a name="pos1170"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Brigadier Leon van der Merwe called me up with regards to what was discussed at the Trim Park on the previous occasion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1171"><a name="pos1171"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINJATSI:</span> You say that you did not know what was the purpose of being called up to Ventersdorp?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1172"><a name="pos1172"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> At that stage, I did not know the purpose.  I only learnt that on the 21st/22nd, then I found out why people were specifically called up to Ventersdorp.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1173"><a name="pos1173"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINJATSI:</span> Sir, now that we know that the Ystergarde seems to have been the elite group within the AWB, would it be fair to say that a member of the Ystergarde would then reasonably be expected to know what the AWB stands for and what is being planned, at least the Officers have to know what is being planned Sir?  Would it be fair?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1174"><a name="pos1174"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1175"><a name="pos1175"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINJATSI:</span> Would it then be fair to say that the Officers who belonged to the elite, being the Ystergarde, would reasonably not be expected to know what is being planned?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1176"><a name="pos1176"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Mr Chairperson, the Ystergarde was there for personal protection, they were not there to know what was being discussed between Mr Terreblanche and his Generals.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1177"><a name="pos1177"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINJATSI:</span> In fact, if action was to be taken would it, I am talking about now not defensive action but to go on the attack, if action was to be taken, would it be the Ystergarde to do it or would it be the Wenkommando, or who would do it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1178"><a name="pos1178"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> I believe the Ystergarde would have received the instructions for attacking.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1179"><a name="pos1179"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINJATSI:</span> Did the Ystergarde ever get such instructions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1180"><a name="pos1180"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Not that I know of Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1181"><a name="pos1181"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINJATSI:</span> And Sir, talking about you driving your motor vehicle to Germiston, why did you make it a condition that if your car is to be made available, the condition would be that you must be the driver?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1182"><a name="pos1182"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Chairperson, a vehicle when you work, a vehicle is the only way of transport from and to work and it is a very important thing.  You cannot, in the Western Transvaal you cannot walk.  The towns are far apart.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1183"><a name="pos1183"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr (indistinct) is has been said that cars are the toys of men, and they protect it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1184"><a name="pos1184"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINJATSI:</span> But Sir, isn't it that you were prepared to lose all your possessions if need be, including your life for the struggle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1185"><a name="pos1185"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct Chairperson, I was prepared to give my life, but my vehicle, I had my wife and children, and they needed a vehicle if they wanted to move from point A to point B.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1186"><a name="pos1186"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINJATSI:</span> Okay, going back to the Germiston bomb.  Who gave you the instructions that you must go and place this bomb at Germiston?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1187"><a name="pos1187"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That was the morning  when I was at Koesterfontein, and Mr Barnard told us that the bomb was going to Germiston.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1188"><a name="pos1188"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINJATSI:</span> Did the members of the Ystergarde wear uniform?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1189"><a name="pos1189"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Chairperson, when we got together for the war, we didn't wear our uniforms at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1190"><a name="pos1190"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINJATSI:</span> Let's talk about before the war, or before you move ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1191"><a name="pos1191"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Before the war we did wear uniforms, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1192"><a name="pos1192"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINJATSI:</span> Did you ever see Mr Barnard wearing a uniform to show that he belongs to you, the Ystergarde?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1193"><a name="pos1193"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Mr Chairperson, Mr Barnard's hair was long and because of that, he wasn't allowed to wear the Ystergarde uniform, but I did see him in the camouflage uniform of the Wenkommando.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1194"><a name="pos1194"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINJATSI:</span> You saw him in uniform of the Wenkommando?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1195"><a name="pos1195"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1196"><a name="pos1196"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINJATSI:</span> And being a member of the Ystergarde and having some basic understanding of the chain of command within the Ystergarde, isn't it that you expected that if instructions were to come to you about operations, they have to come within the line of command within your structure, the Ystergarde, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1197"><a name="pos1197"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Please repeat the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1198"><a name="pos1198"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINJATSI:</span> I am saying if instructions were to be given to you regarding operations that you were to go out on, you would expect that whoever gives you instructions, has to be somebody within the Ystergarde, not the Wenkommando, is that not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1199"><a name="pos1199"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1200"><a name="pos1200"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINJATSI:</span> So far as the Ystergarde is concerned, you cannot say what was Barnard in it, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1201"><a name="pos1201"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Chairperson, my view of Barnard - we concluded our course together in the Ystergarde, so he was a member of the Ystergarde, and if I remember he completed it successfully, so he must have been a Captain within the Ystergarde.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1202"><a name="pos1202"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINJATSI:</span> Did he ever wear any badge to show his rank?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1203"><a name="pos1203"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, in the Wenkommando he carried the rank of Colonel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1204"><a name="pos1204"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINJATSI:</span> No, not in the Wenkommando, in the Ystergarde?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1205"><a name="pos1205"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> I already said in the Ystergarde Barnard did not wear the Ystergarde uniform because of his long hair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1206"><a name="pos1206"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINJATSI:</span> Am I then correct to say that you did not know what his rank would be within the Ystergarde?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1207"><a name="pos1207"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, Chairperson, as far as I was concerned Barnard was a Captain within the Ystergarde.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1208"><a name="pos1208"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINJATSI:</span> You say that before this pre-election bombs, you were told to forget about the ranks?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1209"><a name="pos1209"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> Could the speaker please repeat the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1210"><a name="pos1210"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Can you just repeat your question, please Sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1211"><a name="pos1211"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINJATSI:</span> Did you say that before these pre-election bombings, you were told to forget about the ranks?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1212"><a name="pos1212"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> When we went to Leon van der Merwe, his house, he said that we will not have ranks any more because we are going to the war situation, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1213"><a name="pos1213"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINJATSI:</span> And you are saying that this did not mean that the ranks didn't exist, all that was being said was that you didn't have to mention them any more?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1214"><a name="pos1214"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> I said that when in public we act, or in a war situation where we are amongst people, we are not allowed to address him as Colonel or Major, whatever, you must address him by his name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1215"><a name="pos1215"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINJATSI:</span> Because I want to suggest to you that to the extent that I may believe you when you say that Mr Barnard told you to take the bomb to Germiston,  I want to suggest that he was on a frolic of his own.  He together with the small grouping that you say you saw at Koesterfontein, where the majority of the people were not, that little group were on a frolic of their own, and you became part of it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1216"><a name="pos1216"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Mr Chairperson, I cannot say that because after I spoke to General Nico Prinsloo and also Brigadier Leon van der Merwe, and the instructions we got from the pipe bomb missions, if it did not have the approval of the AWB, I do not think it would have happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1217"><a name="pos1217"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did it have the approval of the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1218"><a name="pos1218"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> I beg your pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1219"><a name="pos1219"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did the whole operation have the approval of the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1220"><a name="pos1220"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, I accepted it because the Generals were with us at the base.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1221"><a name="pos1221"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINJATSI:</span> Sir, look, but if we talk about Koesterfontein, did you see any General there?  When you went to pick up the bombs and drop it at Germiston, were any of the Generals there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1222"><a name="pos1222"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Mr Chairperson, if Mr Barnard asked General Prinsloo that must be stolen, where are the vehicles that must be made available, then I believe that they did know what was going on at Koesterfontein.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1223"><a name="pos1223"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINJATSI:</span> This is but your own conclusion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1224"><a name="pos1224"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, that is my own conclusion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1225"><a name="pos1225"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINJATSI:</span> If you had known that the bomb in Germiston would kill so many people and injure so many, would you still have planted it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1226"><a name="pos1226"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Mr Chairperson, I was in a war situation and irrespective of how many people died, I cannot say if there were more or less people who died, I cannot say if I would have associated myself or not, I was part of the group and I associated myself with what occurred.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1227"><a name="pos1227"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINJATSI:</span> Look Sir, I can see that you are at pains to always stress about how you associated yourself with everything that took place, but for me there is a clear distinction between associating and something that you knew you would have done beforehand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1228"><a name="pos1228"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Out of my own I would not have done it.  If I as an individual or if I did not belong to an organisation, I would not have done it and if I was not in a war situation, I also would not have done it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1229"><a name="pos1229"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINJATSI:</span> Because I am suggesting further that when you wage war, you don't make innocent civilians your target and to the extent that you and your group went about it in that fashion, I suggest that it could not have been a legitimate war, you are fighting the innocent civilians?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1230"><a name="pos1230"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Mr Chairperson, for me it was war and the instructions I received, I executed them as far as I could.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1231"><a name="pos1231"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINJATSI:</span> I am not sure if I understand you well, do you agree with my submission that the way things turned out to be, this could not be justified under any circumstances?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1232"><a name="pos1232"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No, I do not agree with what you say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1233"><a name="pos1233"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINJATSI:</span> Are you saying that for you to get the Volkstaat, you regarded it as perfectly legitimate for you to go about killing and maiming innocent civilians?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1234"><a name="pos1234"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No Mr Chairperson, it was not the idea to kill innocent people, we were in a war situation and some people die within the cross-fire.  I will not say that they were the target.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1235"><a name="pos1235"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I've got a problem with this idea that you talk about innocent and people in cross-fire, or people in the cross-fire.  For someone to be in a cross-fire, there must be a target?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1236"><a name="pos1236"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Mr Chairperson, that morning at Koesterfontein, they told me that the bomb would go to Germiston.  Where the bomb had to be planted, at that stage, I did not know.  I did not know the Germiston area, so I cannot say that it had a target or there was a target, or specific targets were appointed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1237"><a name="pos1237"></a>	For me, the election had to be stopped at all costs and I did not know where to place the bomb.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1238"><a name="pos1238"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you just executed orders or followed orders?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1239"><a name="pos1239"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1240"><a name="pos1240"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Without asking any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1241"><a name="pos1241"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Because we were in a war situation Mr Chairman, I did not question it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1242"><a name="pos1242"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Could you question it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1243"><a name="pos1243"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, I could if I wanted, but at that stage I did not think about questioning it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1244"><a name="pos1244"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINJATSI:</span> Sir you are saying that you did not know then what was the target.  Let me put it this way, if it was to be found that the real target was the black people or the black commuters at the taxi rank, would you still associate yourself with what took place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1245"><a name="pos1245"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Mr Chairperson, if it was an instruction, I would have done it, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1246"><a name="pos1246"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINJATSI:</span> No, no, I understand the question of instructions.  I understand the question of instructions, it seems to me you are arguing or submitting that if you get an instruction, you simply have to comply with them, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1247"><a name="pos1247"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Mr Chairman, if I had to give the command and if I had to do it by myself, I would not have planted the bomb at a taxi rank.  If that is what your question was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1248"><a name="pos1248"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINJATSI:</span> I've got no further questions, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1249"><a name="pos1249"></a><span class="speaker">NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR SINJATSI:</span> .</p>
<p class="line" id="line1250"><a name="pos1250"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR BRACHER:</span> Mr De Wet, you are a new kind of guerrilla to me, you fought volk and father land, but not the motor vehicle, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1251"><a name="pos1251"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Mr Chairperson, for God and the father land, that is correct, but not the vehicle, my vehicle has got nothing to do with that.  For me it was my God, my father land and my nation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1252"><a name="pos1252"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> I am not joking Mr De Wet, it seems to me your evidence comes down to this, that you wanted to drive your vehicle, because you wanted to preserve it for your family if something happened to you, and that if General anything had said to you, we want to use your vehicle for a bomb, you would have said no, because this is your precious car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1253"><a name="pos1253"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Mr Chairperson, when I arrived at Koesterfontein and told them that I am driving with a bomb to Germiston, I was prepared to give everything because if the car was in the back of my car and it was detonated there and the time span that available for me, I would not have time to unhook the trailer, etc.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1254"><a name="pos1254"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> You weren't prepared to give your vehicle away, what changed over night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1255"><a name="pos1255"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> I made my vehicle available Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1256"><a name="pos1256"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> You see, we know until you got to Koesterfontein, you didn't know where you were going with that vehicle at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1257"><a name="pos1257"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Mr Chairperson, when I arrived at Koesterfontein, I was asked to go and hear from the General where is the vehicle that is available.  I went there to General Prinsloo and asked him the person is asking for the vehicle, for a specific vehicle with a tow equipment and I said we do not have such a vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1258"><a name="pos1258"></a>	At that stage I did not know what it was for.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1259"><a name="pos1259"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> That is precisely, you didn't know what your vehicle was needed for until you got to Koesterfontein?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1260"><a name="pos1260"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1261"><a name="pos1261"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Except the fact that you have been to fetch pipe bombs the day before?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1262"><a name="pos1262"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> I picked it up that evening, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1263"><a name="pos1263"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> You see as I understand your evidence it is this and correct me if I am wrong, because as far as I am concerned, your answers to my learned friend, have killed your amnesty application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1264"><a name="pos1264"></a>	Nobody ever gave you instructions to kill innocent people as the target in the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1265"><a name="pos1265"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Nobody gave me the instruction to kill innocent people, that is correct yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1266"><a name="pos1266"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Nobody in the AWB has ever accepted responsibility publicly for any of these bombings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1267"><a name="pos1267"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Mr Chairperson, in the AWB people did not take responsibility in public for this.  For me Nico Prinsloo and Leon van der Merwe were there, they were people who had direct contact with Terreblanche and it had his approval.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1268"><a name="pos1268"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> No, you can't give that answer because you have just told me nobody told you to target innocent civilians, so you can't blame them.  You can't blame them for what you did in Germiston.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1269"><a name="pos1269"></a>	You can't blame them for associating with Bree Street, can you?  How do you blame them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1270"><a name="pos1270"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Mr Chairperson, we were in a war situation, it was told to us that it is war and when I fight in a war, everything is made available, irrespective of what happen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1271"><a name="pos1271"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> You know Mr De Wet, you are like a parrot, you go through a war situation, and I must stop the election.  You had one bomb that you knew about in a trailer, and you had 20 pipe bombs, are you going to cause the stoppage of an election, and you chose a target which has nothing to do with an election, you chose innocent people.  What has, how do you justify that as anything to do with the policy of the ANC, even if it is to stop an election, it is rubbish?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1272"><a name="pos1272"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Mr Chairperson, we were told that we must stop the elections, using any means available and some of them were successful, and I cannot say further.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1273"><a name="pos1273"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr De Wet, in order to simplify the question, how would this bomb in Germiston in any way prevent that large, or come near to preventing that large election, that was an international microscope?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1274"><a name="pos1274"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Mr Chairperson, as far as I know the chaos and damage that occurred after the bombings, would have prevented the people to go to the voting polls, and that is how I saw it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1275"><a name="pos1275"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Mr De Wet, if it was your intention to do something adverse to the election, you could easily have chosen a polling booth which were well known by the time you planted the bomb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1276"><a name="pos1276"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Mr Chairperson, I was not involved with the planning of what will occur in this war, I was a soldier, and I only followed my instructions, I cannot comment on that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1277"><a name="pos1277"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Mr De Wet, I am not accepting these answers about instructions, because you didn't get instructions from anybody to do anything, except to drive a car, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1278"><a name="pos1278"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Mr Chairperson, I made my vehicle available, and nobody told me I must go and plant a bomb.  When I arrived at Koesterfontein, it was said that this bomb was going to Germiston, that in the trailer is a bomb and we are going to Germiston.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1279"><a name="pos1279"></a>	I associated myself, no one said that I must plant it there, I only associated myself when I made my motor vehicle available.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1280"><a name="pos1280"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> But not on anybody's orders, was it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1281"><a name="pos1281"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No one gave me instructions to do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1282"><a name="pos1282"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> You didn't know what target had been chosen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1283"><a name="pos1283"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No, I did not know what target was chosen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1284"><a name="pos1284"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Have you any idea when they gave instructions how to use pipe bombs, what targets were intended for those bombs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1285"><a name="pos1285"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Mr Chairperson, with the pipe bombs they said that missions will go out and what the instructions were, I was not there.  They said they were looking for a driver and two people who would accompany this driver.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1286"><a name="pos1286"></a>	What was said there, I cannot tell you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1287"><a name="pos1287"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Now, when you say you associated yourself with the Bree Street bomb, what do you associate yourself with, the killing of innocent people without instructions from above, is that what you are associating yourself with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1288"><a name="pos1288"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Mr Chairperson, we were in a war situation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1289"><a name="pos1289"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Here we go.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1290"><a name="pos1290"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, Mr Chairperson, we were in a war situation and that which occurred there, I associated myself with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1291"><a name="pos1291"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr De Wet, you come now, arrive in Germiston, in the beginning you drive into Germiston, you do not know where this bomb will be planted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1292"><a name="pos1292"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1293"><a name="pos1293"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And your colleague shows you or indicates to use your words, the orders are that the bomb must be planted here, close to this taxi rank and you say at that stage, you, yourself associated yourself with the planing of the bomb there, knowing that people will be killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1294"><a name="pos1294"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1295"><a name="pos1295"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> With what political purpose, objective, did you associate yourself with that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1296"><a name="pos1296"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Mr Chairperson, in order for the elections to be stopped and that the government of the day will be shown that the Boerevolk will fight for the freedom for their own Volkstaat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1297"><a name="pos1297"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How would the people who was involved with the election, how would they have known that the bomb was planted there in order to create chaos and to disrupt the elections, because you wanted a Volkstaat?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1298"><a name="pos1298"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Mr Chairperson, for me it was that the leaders who were involved, that they used the media and the radio, they would make it known to the world why and where the bombs would be planted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1299"><a name="pos1299"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The previous day was the first bomb that you thought was done by the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1300"><a name="pos1300"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1301"><a name="pos1301"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If it was the AWB, we do not know.  But you thought it was them and no one in the AWB took responsibility for that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1302"><a name="pos1302"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct Mr Chairperson.   There was that evening, the BKA did take responsibility for that and that is all that I can remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1303"><a name="pos1303"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What made you think that the AWB's leadership would take responsibility for the Germiston bomb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1304"><a name="pos1304"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Because we who were gathered there, were AWB members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1305"><a name="pos1305"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, Mr Bracher?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1306"><a name="pos1306"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> You see, you said that you assumed that there was some trap that General Viljoen was setting by participating in the election, but you don't seem to have asked anybody about that?  You just assumed all these things and made up your own mind and your own plans what to do next, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1307"><a name="pos1307"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1308"><a name="pos1308"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> And the same after the Bree Street bombing, nobody takes responsibility on behalf of the AWB, they carrying on, there is war now, but nobody says a word about this is our bomb, they don't say it in Koesterfontein, they don't say it at the game farm, they don't say it in the press, they don't say it on TV that you were watching, you just assumed that this is part of the war?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1309"><a name="pos1309"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Mr Chairperson, after what happened in Bree Street and the BKA took responsibility for it, I realised that Constand Viljoen and Eugene Terreblanche and Ferdi Hartzenberg and the other organisations, who belonged to the BKA would take responsibility for it.  That is how I understood it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1310"><a name="pos1310"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> You keep saying that, but why don't you ask somebody, why don't you ask one of your Generals or one of your superiors before you go and kill some more innocent people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1311"><a name="pos1311"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Mr Chairperson, I was in a war period, and there you do not ask questions.  That is how I was trained.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1312"><a name="pos1312"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Is that your answer, that you don't ask any questions at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1313"><a name="pos1313"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Mr Chairperson, I did ask questions why we fought this war and they said that they wanted to stop the elections, but I didn't ask why.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1314"><a name="pos1314"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Mr De Wet, my question is different, you did not know that this had anything to do with the war struggle of the AWB, because nobody had said so to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1315"><a name="pos1315"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Mr Chairperson, I assumed that what happened there, carried the approval of the leaders, and that is why I associated myself with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1316"><a name="pos1316"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> That is the best you can do isn't it, you accepted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1317"><a name="pos1317"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1318"><a name="pos1318"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1319"><a name="pos1319"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR BRACHER</p>
<p class="line" id="line1320"><a name="pos1320"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you done Mr Bracher?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1321"><a name="pos1321"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Yes, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1322"><a name="pos1322"></a><span class="speaker">MR GCABASHE:</span> Judge, can I just clarify one thing for me.  I thought you said a few minutes ago that you thought one of the BKA Generals would take responsibility, you named Constand Viljoen, etc, is that what you said, just now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1323"><a name="pos1323"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Mr Chairperson, I only said that the people under the BKA who accepted responsibility did that because Mr Terreblanche was a member of the BKA, and that is why it carried the approval of the AWB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1324"><a name="pos1324"></a><span class="speaker">MR GCABASHE:</span> Yes, but again you don't seem to be making a separation between the BKA and the AWB, because you have told us that you were acting as an AWB member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1325"><a name="pos1325"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1326"><a name="pos1326"></a><span class="speaker">MR GCABASHE:</span> So where does the BKA and the taking of the responsibility by the BKA come into this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1327"><a name="pos1327"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Mr Chairperson, the instructions with regards to the bombs, the BKA took responsibility on the news, and I</p>
<p class="line" id="line1328"><a name="pos1328"></a>assumed and accepted that because Terreblanche was a member of the BKA, it would also carry away his approval as well as that of Constand Viljoen and Ferdi Hartzenberg and the other Unions who belonged to the BKA.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1329"><a name="pos1329"></a>	But we did it on the instruction of the AWB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1330"><a name="pos1330"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1331"><a name="pos1331"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.  Mr De Wet, just a few questions.  You were well trained in the AWB and the Wenkommando and the Ystergarde and you held a high position there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1332"><a name="pos1332"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1333"><a name="pos1333"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> You were not one of the men, one of the younger men there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1334"><a name="pos1334"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1335"><a name="pos1335"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> You were personal friends with the leader, Terreblanche?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1336"><a name="pos1336"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> I wouldn't say I was personally befriended with him, but I was his bodyguard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1337"><a name="pos1337"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Yes, you were his bodyguard, and you had contact with him on a much higher level than the other people who met him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1338"><a name="pos1338"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1339"><a name="pos1339"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Something which bothers me a great deal is at Ventersdorp and then Koesterfontein and then at the game farm, were there never order groups where all the men were involved and told what the plans were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1340"><a name="pos1340"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No Chairperson, not during the time I was there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1341"><a name="pos1341"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> It seems to me that here at Koesterfontein was a little group who was doing their own thing, and at the game farm there was another group, doing their own thing, and later, when you all left, it was - you quickly made another bomb and quickly planted it at Jan Smuts, is that the right impression I am getting or is it incorrect?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1342"><a name="pos1342"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No Chairperson, I wouldn't say that.   From what I learnt from the other people, everybody was called up to go and wage a war and to protect the borders of the Volkstaat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1343"><a name="pos1343"></a>	The AWB's Wenkommando was gathered all over the area.  Let's say 20 000 to 30 000 people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1344"><a name="pos1344"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> In what behaviour did they take part, this 20 000 to 30 000 people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1345"><a name="pos1345"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> I do not know which instructions they received.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1346"><a name="pos1346"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> The other problem that I've got is around the 23rd, 24th or was it earlier, of April, you gathered together at the game farm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1347"><a name="pos1347"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> It was Friday the 22nd, or rather it was more the Saturday morning than the Friday evening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1348"><a name="pos1348"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> As we understand from Abe Fourie, a camp was put together, communications network was put up with Head Office, guards were positioned, there was very strong discipline?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1349"><a name="pos1349"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1350"><a name="pos1350"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And as far as we understand, I think Nico Prinsloo, according to him, somebody who deserted would have been shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1351"><a name="pos1351"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct, I don't think it was Nico Prinsloo, I think it was Major Johan Smit who said that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1352"><a name="pos1352"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Whatever, then on the 24th, we have the Bree Street bomb, you know nothing about that until later that is?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1353"><a name="pos1353"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1354"><a name="pos1354"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Then the Germiston bomb, the Monday and then all the pipe bombs on the same day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1355"><a name="pos1355"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1356"><a name="pos1356"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And suddenly the whole camp is dispersing, everybody is getting up and going home?  It seems they are fed up with all of this, they want to go home, they want to go their wives, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1357"><a name="pos1357"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No, I wouldn't say the camp was breaking up.  Some people came and asked if they could not go and see their wives.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1358"><a name="pos1358"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> This is after a few days?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1359"><a name="pos1359"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, Chairperson.  I was not willing to go home at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1360"><a name="pos1360"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> But Mr De Wet, let's be honest here, it does not sound to me, it does not resemble an army who is very determined to fight for their country and to fight till the end, it does not resemble something like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1361"><a name="pos1361"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Chairperson, the view I had at that stage and why I did not approve of the meeting, it was people who came there to fight a war and after a few days being away from their wives, they wanted to go home.  I did not approve of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1362"><a name="pos1362"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Now just the last question, as Judge Flemming said, there was this very strict discipline, after a while anybody could come and go as they want.  He used the word (indistinct)?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1363"><a name="pos1363"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No Chairperson, even at the shooting range, there were very strong security measures in force.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1364"><a name="pos1364"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> The targets, according to what my learned colleagues asked you, as far as the pipe bombs are concerned, would you agree and this is the acts of accusation in the High Court, the one pipe bomb was at Westonaria, Carltonville at a taxi rank where a pipe bomb was thrown, specifically where black people got their transportation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1365"><a name="pos1365"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is how I understood it from the court, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1366"><a name="pos1366"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Then there was another one at 3rd and Park Street in Randfontein, also once again, a taxi stand.  Nobody got injured there, but yet again the target was a black taxi stand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1367"><a name="pos1367"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Chairperson, I do not know what the target was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1368"><a name="pos1368"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> I put it to you now, do you agree with me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1369"><a name="pos1369"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> You will have to look at the facts, and if I look at it, yes, it would seem the case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1370"><a name="pos1370"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> The Bloed Street one, 7th Avenue in Marabastad, Pretoria.  This pipe bomb was thrown at a cafe and also basically a rank where there would have been black people drinking cold drinks and sitting waiting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1371"><a name="pos1371"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> I would say the majority was black, but there were definitely blacks as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1372"><a name="pos1372"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> By Sannie's Cafe, Marabastad?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1373"><a name="pos1373"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1374"><a name="pos1374"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Also Bree Street, we heard evidence that most of the victims were black people and also Germiston, do you agree?  I am making a statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1375"><a name="pos1375"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No, I agree with your statement Sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1376"><a name="pos1376"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> And as the Chairperson asked your co-applicants, you did not choose targets in Houghton or Sandton or Sunnyside or any white area, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1377"><a name="pos1377"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> I was not involved with that, so I cannot say the people chose it or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1378"><a name="pos1378"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> But it was never discussed that you would plant bombs or throw bombs in purely white areas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1379"><a name="pos1379"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No, it was never discussed Chairperson.  I cannot comment on that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1380"><a name="pos1380"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Finally, the statement that Mr Terreblanche faxed through to the Committee, I just want your comment on the last paragraph.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1381"><a name="pos1381"></a>	He said I accept also that in the difficult time which preceded the election, I made several public speeches and that the content of my speeches by members of the AWB, they could be interpreted by AWB members as instructions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1382"><a name="pos1382"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> As I already testified Chairperson, things he said from the stage, I interpreted them as instructions and I also thought that it carried away his approval.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1383"><a name="pos1383"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> He doesn't say that it was his instructions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1384"><a name="pos1384"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No, that is correct.  He does not say pertinently that we had to do it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1385"><a name="pos1385"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> Thank you Chairperson, no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1386"><a name="pos1386"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Mr De Wet, the question of double ranks I do not really understand that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1387"><a name="pos1387"></a>	The whole question of ... </p>

<p class="line" id="line1392"><a name="pos1392"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> Is it correct that Mr Barnard and Mr Myburgh was subsequently convicted of offences relating to further killing sprees aimed at the black population?</p>

How does it have any connection with this amnesty application?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1405"><a name="pos1405"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> You say that you made your vehicle available and then you continued and you said something about Cliffie?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1406"><a name="pos1406"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Mr Barnard, when we were together, he called us together, he said this bomb is going to Germiston and because of the pipe bomb missions which we discussed earlier the previous evening, I reconciled myself with it and I was prepared to take the bomb to Germiston.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1407"><a name="pos1407"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Now, you said you made your vehicle available.  This you said because of what General Nico Prinsloo told you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1408"><a name="pos1408"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, that he didn't have a vehicle for Barnard and therefore I offered him mine because it had a tow bar on it, and this was on instruction from General Nico Prinsloo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1409"><a name="pos1409"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Were you specifically asked for a vehicle with a tow bar?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1411"><a name="pos1411"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And when you got back, once again you were told to take the tow bar off?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1418"><a name="pos1418"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No Chairperson, Abraham Myburgh once came from Head Office, he came to pick up things at my house and then he told me, he addressed me as Oom Jan, and he said Oom Jan, it seems to me Terreblanche is going to wage war now, he called the people up to Western Transvaal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1419"><a name="pos1419"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Did you know about the call up instructions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1420"><a name="pos1420"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, I did Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1421"><a name="pos1421"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> You also made mention of Koper Myburgh, you were asked who told you to go to Koesterfontein, that is the Sunday evening, when you picked up the pipe bombs, you said Koper Myburgh told you that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1422"><a name="pos1422"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Chairperson, Koper Myburgh called me and told me that General Nico Prinsloo wanted me and then he asked me to take Myburgh to Koesterfontein to go and pick up things there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1423"><a name="pos1423"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> So then from there you went to a meeting, that is your evidence or rather you were called into a meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1424"><a name="pos1424"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1425"><a name="pos1425"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Koper Myburgh was also involved in that meeting, even though you would not know that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1426"><a name="pos1426"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1427"><a name="pos1427"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> You were also told that you executed this operation on your own initiative, your little group, but I would refer you to Volume 2, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1428"><a name="pos1428"></a>	I refer you to Volume 2, page 7 that is the Volume in front of you, that is the charge sheet when you were on trial?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1429"><a name="pos1429"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1430"><a name="pos1430"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And there in paragraph 2, the State alleged in your case that these acts were committed in order to prevent the election?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1431"><a name="pos1431"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1432"><a name="pos1432"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And that is how you submitted it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1433"><a name="pos1433"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes, that is how I submitted it in that case as well Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1434"><a name="pos1434"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> No further questions, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1435"><a name="pos1435"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS VAN DER WALT</p>
<p class="line" id="line1436"><a name="pos1436"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Mr De Wet, the question of double ranks confuses me, it would seem to me that there were Officers and even the leader of the AWB who sat on different chairs or who wore different hats.  Let's take Eugene Terreblanche, as far as you know, where was he involved in the capacity of a leader?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1437"><a name="pos1437"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Chairperson, Terreblanche, the only time he was a leader, was the time he was a leader of the AWB.  He was not the leader of any other organisation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1438"><a name="pos1438"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Where was he in a leadership structure?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1439"><a name="pos1439"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> The BKA, the Volksfront - that is the only three I can tell you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1440"><a name="pos1440"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> And then Mr Barnard, which hats did he wear, on which chairs did he sit on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1441"><a name="pos1441"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Mr Chairperson, in the AWB there are two facets, the AWB Wenkommando and the Ystergarde which is a special unit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1442"><a name="pos1442"></a>	In the Wenkommando there was a rank structure as well as in the Ystergarde.  When you had done the Ystergarde course, you either became a Lieutenant or a Captain once you have completed your course.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1443"><a name="pos1443"></a>	That is where you find the double ranks, in the Ystergarde he was a Captain, but in the AWB's Wenkommando he was a Commandant or a Colonel, whichever the rank was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1444"><a name="pos1444"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> When Barnard would give instructions to someone, would he say I am giving you this instruction in my capacity as a Captain in the Ystergarde or in my capacity as a Colonel in the Wenkommando?  How was it channelled down?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1445"><a name="pos1445"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> If he gave an instruction, it would have been as Colonel because he worked directly with Terreblanche.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1446"><a name="pos1446"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> So his rank, it seemed to me that his rank within the Ystergarde didn't really matter, it confuses me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1447"><a name="pos1447"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Chairperson, I was a Colonel myself in the AWB Wenkommando and a Captain in the Ystergarde.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1448"><a name="pos1448"></a>	At one stage we were told to choose, either we are with the Wenkommando or the Ystergarde with regards to operations, and there I chose to stay with the Garde.  That was my need within the AWB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1449"><a name="pos1449"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Do you know what Barnard's choice was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1450"><a name="pos1450"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No Chairperson, I cannot say what his choice was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1451"><a name="pos1451"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> And then one further question, Mr Barnard, maybe I didn't hear something correct along the way, but Mr Barnard, wasn't he in another organisation as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1452"><a name="pos1452"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No Chairperson, not that I know of.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1453"><a name="pos1453"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Thank you Chair.  Two questions really, you mentioned that you spoke to Nico Prinsloo about what you had seen at Koesterfontein and this must have been either probably on the morning of the 25th, this is right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1454"><a name="pos1454"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> It was the Sunday evening Chairperson, after I returned from Koesterfontein.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1455"><a name="pos1455"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> So Sunday evening was the 25th or the 24th, just remind me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1456"><a name="pos1456"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> The 24th Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1457"><a name="pos1457"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> What did he say to you in response?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1458"><a name="pos1458"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> He didn't give me any comments when I told him what was going on there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1459"><a name="pos1459"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> He said nothing at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1460"><a name="pos1460"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> He only asked me if I would make my vehicle available.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1461"><a name="pos1461"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Now the people from Natal arrived on the 25th, that is correct isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1462"><a name="pos1462"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct, when I returned from the Germiston bomb mission, the people from Natal were there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1463"><a name="pos1463"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> I asked this of one of the other applicants, and I will ask it of you.  In your opinion, isn't it strange that Nico Prinsloo didn't mention the activities of your little grouping to those people from Natal, just to motivate them and tell them that we are really going for it this time, wasn't that strange?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1464"><a name="pos1464"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Chairperson, I wasn't involved there so whatever General Prinsloo told them, I cannot say what he told them, I was not present.  I do not know what he told them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1465"><a name="pos1465"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> You misunderstand my question, I want your opinion as somebody who was fairly highly placed in the Garde.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1466"><a name="pos1466"></a>	Wasn't it strange to you or is it not strange to you even today, that he would not have mentioned this very important little motivational issue to the chaps from Natal?  I mean you had seen the bomb in the making, you had mentioned it to him, so it wasn't a State secret or an AWB secret, yet he said nothing at all, he actually referred to the BKA, the Boere Krisis Aksie, as the people who had been setting off bombs.  He said nothing about the Koesterfontein grouping and what they were getting up to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1467"><a name="pos1467"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Chairperson, I do not know why he didn't tell them that we were involved with that, I cannot give comment on that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1468"><a name="pos1468"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Slightly different aspect, you continually refer to instructions that you were given, you were following orders, yet at the same time you were allowed to set conditions as a member, a committed member, you were allowed to say to them, I will only give you my motor vehicle if, now how does that conditional participation, how do you marry that with the fact that you were there to take orders?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1469"><a name="pos1469"></a>	Sorry, just help me understand why you could pick and choose when to take orders or follow orders and when to say to them, go and jump, I will only do it if?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1470"><a name="pos1470"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Chairperson, it was my vehicle and at that stage I said I will make my vehicle available if I could be the driver, because it is my car.  It is not that I put an ultimatum to him.  It wasn't that I said if I cannot drive my car, you cannot have it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1471"><a name="pos1471"></a>	I only said I wanted to drive the car.  No ultimatum was put.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1472"><a name="pos1472"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> But essentially this is what I have understood you to be saying, that you said to them, you are the person who is going to drive that motor vehicle, at the same time you have continuously said to us you were there to follow orders, you did very, very serious things because you were following orders, but the minor matter of who was driving your car, you dictated the terms on, essentially.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1473"><a name="pos1473"></a>	I am just trying to marry the part of you that takes orders unquestioningly and the other half of you that will say to them, you can have my car if I drive it.  The two halves, put them together for me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1474"><a name="pos1474"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Mr Chairperson, Prinsloo needed a car, he did not have a car.  The stolen vehicles which he had to give to Barnard was not available, and because of that I told him my vehicle, I will make it available to you if I can be the driver of the car.  It is not an ultimatum, it is nothing like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1475"><a name="pos1475"></a>	If he said you cannot be the driver, then I wouldn't have made my vehicle available.  If that is what you are asking Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1476"><a name="pos1476"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> A final aspect, you have said to us today that you lied in the Supreme Court to prove your innocence, that is the way you put it, both in English and in Afrikaans?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1477"><a name="pos1477"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1478"><a name="pos1478"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> You are giving evidence here today to prove your guilt essentially, the exact opposite?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1479"><a name="pos1479"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1480"><a name="pos1480"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Why should we accept what you are saying to us today when you were quite happy to lie before a Judge in the Supreme Court, having taken the oath, about your participation in these events?  Why should this Committee believe what you have to say today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1481"><a name="pos1481"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Chairperson, in the Supreme Court, if I then spoke the truth, I would have not gotten 25 years, I would have gotten longer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1482"><a name="pos1482"></a>	Here in front of the Truth Commission I feel that if I speak the truth, you can reduce my sentence, and that is why I am telling you the truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1483"><a name="pos1483"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> You see before both forums you take the oath, you have taken the oath here, you took the oath then, and the dilemma I am left with just as an individual panel member is, which oath are you really, when did you tell the truth, was it then, is it now?	I still have a bit of a difficulty there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1484"><a name="pos1484"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Chairperson, when I was told that I can tell the truth at the Truth Commission and I can get amnesty, that is what I heard, and when I came here today, I am speaking the truth as far as I can.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1485"><a name="pos1485"></a>	I have already said that in the Supreme Court I told a lie in order to prove my innocence.  If I spoke the truth in the High Court, I would not have received 25 years prison sentence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1486"><a name="pos1486"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Thank you Mr De Wet, thanks Judge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1487"><a name="pos1487"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr De Wet, this war that you talk about, and if I understand your evidence it took on the form of planing bombs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1488"><a name="pos1488"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> Yes bomb planting and taking up weapons, to take up weapons where you shoot someone like in a war, in the Defence Force.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1489"><a name="pos1489"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When would this have happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1490"><a name="pos1490"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> With the speeches that was made, we will not negotiate, we will negotiate over the barrel of a gun, and I saw that the planting of bombs was the run up to this revolution and that in the end, with the elections, we will then take up arms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1491"><a name="pos1491"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But according to you, the only reason for the war at that stage, was to stop the elections?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1492"><a name="pos1492"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman, that was my reason.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1493"><a name="pos1493"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No other reasons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1494"><a name="pos1494"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No, I had no other reasons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1495"><a name="pos1495"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You gave evidence that you were asked to choose between the Ystergarde and the Wenkommando?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1496"><a name="pos1496"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1497"><a name="pos1497"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Your answer was that you would rather choose the Ystergarde because it was your work?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1498"><a name="pos1498"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1499"><a name="pos1499"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you paid for that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1500"><a name="pos1500"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No Mr Chairperson, I did it freely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1501"><a name="pos1501"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What do you mean when you said you made the choice, because it is your work or what you did at the Ystergarde was a job?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1502"><a name="pos1502"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> I did the course of the Ystergarde, because for me it was important that the people who were with me in the AWB, I wanted to train them and I wanted to become an instructor within the Ystergarde.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1503"><a name="pos1503"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You just answered that the reason why you make this application is to help yourself getting out of jail?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1504"><a name="pos1504"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> That is correct Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1505"><a name="pos1505"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Tell me Mr De Wet, after everything that happened, did you go through the trouble of finding out who is the families of the people who died?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1506"><a name="pos1506"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No Mr Chairperson, I did not go through the trouble, because outside I've got no one to ask except the AWB who supports me at this stage to do any jobs for me.  There is no one within the Prison Service who supports us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1507"><a name="pos1507"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I am asking you did you go through the trouble to find out who were the families of the people who died by the actions of the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1508"><a name="pos1508"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No Mr Chairperson, I only read in newspaper articles that were available to me, I only learnt their names there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1509"><a name="pos1509"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How do you feel about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1510"><a name="pos1510"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> My personal opinion at this stage is that I feel sorry for people who had to die within a lost cause, because we did lose this struggle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1511"><a name="pos1511"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you try ultimately through your leader, to send a message to these people to say how sorry you are?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1512"><a name="pos1512"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No Mr Chairperson, there is no one who I can ask.  I did write letters to people, but no one wrote back about things I asked, I wanted to ask them what was going on in the country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1513"><a name="pos1513"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I don't think you understand my point.  I ask did you try to make peace with the families of the people who were killed or unfortunately killed, in the actions just before the elections?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1514"><a name="pos1514"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1515"><a name="pos1515"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you think about it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1516"><a name="pos1516"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WET:</span> No, I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1517"><a name="pos1517"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1518"><a name="pos1518"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Mr Chair, sorry before we adjourn, sorry Mr Chair, could I approach the Committee just on one aspect before we adjourn.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1519"><a name="pos1519"></a>	Mr Chair, my understanding of the position when we commenced Wednesday was that counsels in respect of applicants 1 and 2 had had their mandate terminated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1520"><a name="pos1520"></a>	At a later stage applicant 2 appeared personally and said that he is withdrawing his application.  Applicant 1 merely handed in Annexure B but his application as such is not withdrawn, is it still before you or not?  By who Sir, with respect Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1521"><a name="pos1521"></a>	With respect Mr Chairman, if you look at Annexure B, as I gave instructions to my lawyers to make this application, that is the difficulty I have.  If his application has been withdrawn, he might be asked to be a witness at some stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1522"><a name="pos1522"></a>	I just want to get confirmation on that, I don't want to ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1523"><a name="pos1523"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> (Microphone not switched on)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1524"><a name="pos1524"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRIOR:</span> The problem that I have is that Counsel indicated on Wednesday morning that they, their mandate had been terminated and hence they were not proceeding.  Mr Koper Myburgh personally withdrew his application, but Mr Barnard says in his Annexure B as I gave instructions to my representatives to withdraw my application, I've got no more interest.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1525"><a name="pos1525"></a>	He doesn't as such say I am withdrawing, he says I gave my lawyers instructions to withdraw my application.  That hasn't been done yet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1526"><a name="pos1526"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> (Microphone not switched on)  Mrs Van der Walt indicated to us that her instructions were to withdraw the matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1527"><a name="pos1527"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> I did withdraw.  My instruction that morning was ended but as Mr Prior can confirm, my instruction was actually as I heard from Mr Prior, that it was terminated.  Then there was another Advocate, Mr Rautenbach, who would have acted on behalf of Mr Barnard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1528"><a name="pos1528"></a>	I talked to him on the phone just before we started, and he said that he received instructions to withdraw the application, but he said to Barnard that he's got no instructions, because he withdrew it and that is all that I know about this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1529"><a name="pos1529"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Mr Chairperson, I discussed this aspect with Mr Prior, there were letters written to the South African Police Service as well as the Amnesty or the TRC and where application is made for the file of Mr Koekemoer.  We need Mr Koekemoer's file, he was an informant and we've got evidence that he was paid or a certain amount was paid to him, and that his instructions were given to him by the State, what his functions would be in order to infiltrate the AWB and what he reported back to the Security Police and what the Police knows about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1530"><a name="pos1530"></a>	The Police, with respect, was part of this action.  As it came forward from the case that there was a period for Mr Koekemoer to report back to the Police, they knew about the bombs and it may seem that the Police were involved in this matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1531"><a name="pos1531"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How relevant is it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1532"><a name="pos1532"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> With respect Mr Chairperson, it is relevant in order for there to be a full disclosure.  It is further more relevant for the interest of the families, the type of bombs that were built, the bombs that were improved by Koekemoer and if the Police knew about it and did nothing about it, the Police is definitely party to it and in the general light that it is the function of the TRC that these things will not be repeated in the future, it is of great importance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1533"><a name="pos1533"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Prinsloo, we are not here to fight any other battle.   If such allegations are made, then you can call in this evidence.</p>
