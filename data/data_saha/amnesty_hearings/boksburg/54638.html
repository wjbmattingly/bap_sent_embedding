<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> Good morning.</p>

<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, Mr Madasa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR MADASA:</span> Mr Ndabe, how old are you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> I am 39 years old.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> How far did you go at school?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> I failed from five.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> December 1993, did you live in (indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> That is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Which Extension and Block?</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> (Indistinct) Extension 2, Block D.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> In the SDU, were you a patroller or an operator?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> I was a patroller.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> In the killings of December 1993, were you involved?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> No.  I only participated in capturing (indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> How did it come about that you were involved in capturing those people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> In the morning just after sunrise we left, myself and Sonti and Shuga.  We had been sent to report to Mnyala that the youth has already attacked people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Who sent you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> I don't remember quite well, whether that was from the community or himself, as he was a member of the Executive Defence.  I just escorted him or accompanied him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> This day that you are talking about, is this the day of the killing or is it the day when Blanko and Bulelwa died?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> Blanko died on that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Where did you meet these people who sent you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> At Bulelwa's corpse.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> You went to Bulelwa's corpse?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> That is where we were, we were keeping guard the whole night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> With whom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> We were quite many in number plus the community of Block F.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Were you asked to guard the corpse or did you go there voluntarily?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> It is our culture as black people, we can't leave our corpse alone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Did you hear that Bulelwa had died or how did it come about that you went to her body?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> As part of the group, we heard the whistle blow.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> You heard a whistle, and then you went to Bulelwa's body?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> That is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Perhaps Mr Ndabe, if you could just tell us how it came to be that you were at the spot where Bulelwa's body was found and how it came about that you went with Sonti and Shuga to make a report to Mnyala and what happened thereafter, do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> I don't quite understand what you want.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I am saying you have already told us that you did not kill anyone.  What you did was to escort or accompany the people who were going to capture and you took part there, and you have already made mention of the fact that as a man who belonged to that particular organisation or group, you had to go as part of the culture to where the corpse was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a>	You were in the company of Sonti and Shuga to convey the report to Mnyala.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now, what I am asking from you please concisely explain to us as to how did it come about that you landed right next to Bulelwa's corpse and found yourself going to Mnyala, and also we want to know what happened subsequently, in other words we want for you to explain to us exactly what you did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> The way we used to operate was in this fashion, if there is a place that has been attacked, we would hear a whistle blow, because people will alert us by blowing the whistle, and we will run to this thing where this whistle was being blown.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a>	That is exactly what happened on that particular day.  We heard the whistle and we had to rush in the direction where the whistle was being blown from and that is what we found Bulelwa's corpse.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> We were there for quite some time, and some other comrades that is next to the corpse, some other comrades left to go and sleep at night, since they had to go to work the following morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> Towards the early hours of the morning, or at dawn, we heard sounds of gun fire.  Suddenly there was fire.  We had to rush there with some other men who were with me around the corpse of Bulelwa that is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a>	We found Blanko's shack burning fiercely.  We were quite many in number and we tried to extinguish the fire.  Then comrade Oscar arrived and explained to us, he was already from Sonti.  He was telling us, that is Oscar, who killed the person, who killed Blanko and was seen killing Blanko.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Did he tell you who did he see?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> He did mention his name.  He said Tusaneng was the person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> We therefore left and went back to Bulelwa's corpse, some of us that is.    Some left in search of some other people like Ntshebe Dondolo.  I forgot the other one who used to be a Chairman at F, Nxeba, I just remembered.  His name is Nxeba.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a>	They went.  They went to fetch the Peace Committee at the hospital to fetch the corpse.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> Comrades left us there by the corpse.  When Nxeba's car drove towards B or A, I am not too sure, we also heard gun shots at that point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> When these men followed towards that direction, they came across the other group and more gun shots were heard and we were still there, keeping guard at the corpse, so we don't know exactly what was happening, we just saw them coming back with youth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a>	It was Nongeba Sonti and Shuga was also there.  I don't know the others.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Do you know those kids they brought back?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> I never knew them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> Those kids were taken to a shack which was near, just closer to where Bulelwa's corpse was laying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> Rooivalk was chosen and somebody else, to keep guard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> The group left again, going to locate as to where Nxeba was.  When they came back, they brought more kids and claimed that they met them somewhere, and Tusaneng was amongst that group if I am not mistaken this time around.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> And when they arrived, they were also forwarded to the shack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Did they return with one person or more than one person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> I don't know how many they were, but it was a group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> Early in the morning, I felt so sleepy, I felt I wanted to go to bed and sleep and I joined Nxeba as they were leaving, I left with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Whom did you join?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> I joined Nxeba and Shuga.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Nxeba who?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> Nxeba Sonti.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Where did you go?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> I was going with them to where they were going, they were going to Mnyala's house.   We met Tsepo at the taxi rank and we asked him about the matter that transpired yesterday since he was also sent.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> And he told us that they were shot and one escaped and no one could tell as to who was running into which direction and so forth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> And he went to sleep wherever he slept and we left him alone and we got into a taxi and we told him where to go to a meeting where people had gathered.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> The taxi took us to Mnyala and we alighted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> Just after getting out of the taxi, we saw Mnyala standing with Nxeba and three boys that belonged to the youth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> When we alighted from the taxi, we approached their direction.  One ran, fled and shot at us at the same time as he was running.</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Do you know who that was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> Yes, I do know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Who?</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> His name was Vips.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Did he shoot at you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> Yes, he was shooting towards our direction, but no one got shot as he was also running.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> We captured the other three.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Do you know them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> No, I don't know them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> When we searched them, we discovered a pistol from one of them.  That I handed over to the Committee, the pistol as Shuga was also part of the Committee member, SDU Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> Mnyala said we should go with them to 6, he will follow.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Did you do so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> Yes, we went with them.  He said he will follow us later.</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> Indeed, we went with them to 6.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Where is 6?</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> That is Muleleki Extension 2.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Who took them to the shack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> Shuga went with them to the shack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Which shack, the one that was next to Bulelwa's body?</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> The first shack that was closer to where Bulelwa's corpse was laying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> I left after that and I went to my house, since I did not sleep at night.  Just between Block D and Block E, there is an open veld there at E.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> I met the mother of one of the late or the deceased.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Do you know her, her names?</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> I don't know the name, all I know it is Pinky's mother.  She asked me as to where her child was.  She mentioned the name, I said I don't know the name, I don't know exactly.  I don't remember the name she mentioned, but she did mention a name to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTATA:</span> What is the name, you said you met somebody's mother - Pinky?</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> Pinky's mother.</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTATA:</span> Who is Pinky</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> Pinky is her daughter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> She had to explain and describe the clothes that the girl was wearing, or the child was wearing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> After she described the child, I said the child is there in the shack.  And I also told her that people are still there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> And I left her and went on ahead to my house to sleep.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Did you participate further in anything?</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTATA:</span> You remained in hour house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> I slept in my house.  I woke up in the afternoon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Do you know anything about the killings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> I heard about that when I met the other comrades.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> But you were not there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> I wasn't there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Why did you participate in rounding up those boys?</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> I was a SDU member and we were protecting the community or guarding the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I thought you said you had been tired of remaining near the corpse?  I thought you had said you were tired of guarding the corpse?</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> Yes.   When I left with Sonti I was beginning to feel dizzy and sleepy because I hadn't slept.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You went to capture those boys because you were tired?</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> I was tired of just sitting, because as I was sitting, I was falling asleep, so I had to do some action.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Why did you join Sonti and others to collect more people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> As I have already explained, I said that I was sitting down, I was falling asleep as a result of sitting down.  Now, I felt I had to do something to get involved in some kind of action.</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> My question is were you required to join them, did you see that as part of your work?</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTATA:</span> No one ordered you to join  Shuga and so on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> No one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTATA:</span> Were you ordered to guard Bulelwa's body?</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> I wasn't ordered.</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTATA:</span> Did you respond to the SDU call?</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> The whistle call, do you mean?</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTATA:</span> Dit you respond to the whistle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTATA:</span> Which was calling SDU members to go and ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> Yes, I responded to the whistle call.</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTATA:</span> Was guarding Bulelwa's body, part of your duty in the SDU?</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTATA:</span> Was the capturing of these boys with Sonti, part of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> Yes, it was part of the defence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTATA:</span> The capturing of these boys, how was that going to protect the community?</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> Capturing those boys will be protecting the community in this way - these boys had killed members of the community of Muleleki Extension 2.</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Who were those members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> It was Bulelwa and Blanko.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> Another point of fact was about the infiltration of the third force, because they called themselves ANC Youth League but in actions, they were actually not ANC Youth League.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTATA:</span> Are you saying that they called themselves members of the ANC Youth League, but their conduct was inconsistent with members of the ANC Youth League?</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> Yes, that is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> What else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> And the weapons that they had in their possession, were weapons that were being used by the Police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> What did that indicate the fact that the weapons were similar to the Police's?</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> That indicated some collaboration of some kind between them and the third force.</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTATA:</span> Are you suggesting that because they carried firearms similar to those carried by the Police, therefore they were working hand in hand with the Police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> That is what I am saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTATA:</span> Do you know how they got - did you personally see anyone of them carrying a weapon similar to the one used by the Police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> I do hope that in my statement that is clear, that when we searched them, the other three, we realised the pistol.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> What kind of a pistol was this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> It was a 9, the one that Police use.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> It was a 9?</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> 9 what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> A short 9.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTATA:</span> Did you ask him how he got hold of that short 9?</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> No, I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTATA:</span> Could he not have stolen it from the Police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> I wouldn't know that far.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Do you have any other evidence that the weapons they had, were similar to those of the Police, besides this 9 mm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> No, I don't have any other evidence to that effect, except for what I have already told you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Did you hear from your comrades in the SDU about them having firearms similar to those of the Police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> I had heard from comrade Sonti when they were going to kill the Majosi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> What did he tell you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> He said he arrived to him with Majosi's cousin, passing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> What did he say about firearms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> He said they had R1's.</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> These persons, from your information, had been carrying these firearms which were used by the Police even before Bulelwa and Blanko were killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And prior to Blanko and Bulelwa being killed, they had already demonstrated conduct which you believe was inconsistent with the members of the ANC Youth League?</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> I don't quite understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Before Blanko and Bulelwa were killed, you already have seen that their conduct was not consistent, or was not the way the ANC Youth League members carried themselves.  They were not killed prior to the death of Bulelwa and Blanko?</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> There is one, the one that made them to disassociate themselves with us because we tried to stop them from their conduct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that the reason why they were not killed before?</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> Blanko and Bulelwa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> It is not the reason.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What are you suggesting, I am asking you whether is there any reason why they were not killed prior to the death of Bulelwa and Blanko?</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> We did not have any proof before that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Proof of what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> To catch them red-handed you know, because in Blanko's case, we also realised some boxes of cigarettes which were proof to us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What proof did you require?</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> About proof that of something that they had in hand from where they attacked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You see, I am asking you and you have told us that prior to the death of Blanko and Bulelwa, you believed that the persons who were captured and killed, were engaged in a conduct which was inconsistent with members of the ANC Youth League.</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What I want to find out from you is if that were to be the case, and I think you have told us, we know that they had been involved in the killing of Majosi for example, was a member of the South African Communist Party we were told, they were also involved, we were told in the hijacking of a bakkie for a Mr Makanya for example.</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a>	What we want to find out from you, if you had all of this information, why were they not killed prior to the death of Bulelwa and Blanko?</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> That question is difficult.  It is a quite difficult question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes Mr Madasa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Now Blanko was the Chairman of SDU, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> What did his death mean to you in relation to the protection of the community?</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a>	Did you understand my question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> No, I don't understand your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Blanko was the Chairman of SDU?</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> He was killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> There was evidence from Oscar that he was killed by ANC Youth League?</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Was his death connected with the protection of the community?</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> You mean the death of Blanko?  It was not related, they were attacking the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> No, you don't understand me.  Let me put it this way ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> You see, we were protecting the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes, I know.  Was the killing of SDU members, going to expose the community to the ANC Youth League?</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Now, did you benefit anything from capturing those boys?</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> I have no further questions Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MADASA:</span> .</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, Mr Mapoma?</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Thank you Chairperson.  I have no questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.   Mr Sibanyoni?</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.  Mr Ndabe, you say Pinky's mother described how her son was dressed, did I understand you correctly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Now, was her son one of those whom you captured?</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> Those are the ones we captured, three of them, he was one of the three in other words.</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Now, do you I mean today, not at that stage, today, do you know who is Pinky's mother in other words, her name or her surname?</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> I wouldn't say that, I don't know the surname, because the husband we refer to him as Mokoena if I am not mistaken.</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> So, the mother we are talking about is Mrs Mokoena, is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> I don't want to confirm that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> At the stage when you were capturing these, the three boys you captured, did you know what will eventually happen with them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> But one of the applicants yesterday said that if a person kills, that person would be killed.  Did you hear that applicant saying so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> I wouldn't say I heard this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> And then the killing of these youth, to me appears as if it was an avenge for the death of Blanko, you were retaliating because they killed Blanko.  What do you say about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> No, it is not so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Okay, thank you Mr Chairperson, no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Malan?</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr Ndabe, this Pinky, was she a friend of Bulelwa's?</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> No, that is not the one, that is not the Pinky.</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So that is another Pinky?</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> That is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> No further questions, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, Mr Motata?</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTATA:</span> Mr Ndabe, before the Youth League separated themselves from you, that is the SDU, you used to patrol together?</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> That is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTATA:</span> Just explain to us, we know from the evidence we have heard that operators used to carry guns and those would be issued by the Commander Regional or Central, but they used to carry guns and in this respect AK47's, is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTATA:</span> Were the members of the Youth League, when they joined you, also being issued with that type of weaponry?</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTATA:</span> We are told that the operators were trained, now when you were patrolling or rather let's put it this way, members of the Youth League who joined you, were they trained?</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTATA:</span> You have referred to incidents of shootings, but it would appear that whilst this ensued nobody (indistinct) injured in the process and since your members that is the SDU were trained, they couldn't shoot straight could they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> It is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTATA:</span> You happen to know Pinky's mother, she took the trouble to describe the clothing of her son.  Would you know that the son was one of the victims that is one of the people who died?</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTATA:</span> To date, from 1993 December, 7, have you endeavoured to find out who this son was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTATA:</span> You were probably vindicated that you had achieved your objective in killing the victims in the process of protecting the community, are you saying that to us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> That is not what I am saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTATA:</span> We know, or rather let's ask you, do you regard the families of the victims as part of the community which you tried to protect?</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTATA:</span> And it would be human nature that if one of the members of the community and let's confine ourselves to Muleleki, that if something befalls that family, you would find out what happened from that family, wouldn't that be so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTATA:</span> These members of the African National Congress Youth League, were not a menace to only the other members of the community, but their families too were threatened, would I be right if I think along those lines?</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> I wouldn't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTATA:</span> But we should accept that when you protected the community of Muleleki, the members of the victims, the families of the victims where you were trying to protect them as well, should we accept that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTATA:</span> Thank you Chairperson, I've got no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> The identity of Pinky's mother, would her first name be Alphina?</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> I don't know the name, she is also present here.  I may ask her if you so wish that she may identify herself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I just want to make sure because we have information that Mrs Alphina Mokati says that she met up with you and at that stage, there was also Mrs Constance Sindesi was also there and that you were asked about their children, and that you answered only Mrs Mokati, Alphina Mokati, told her that her child was indeed in the shack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a>	Were there two women that asked you, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Then if that is so, then the Youth's name would have been Isaac Mogadi if the woman ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> Isaac Mogadi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Yes, could it be?</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> I think she said something to that effect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Okay, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I understand that you fell tired and you went to your house to sleep? ... (tape ends) ... that you were going home?</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> I did not report to anyone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is there a reason why you did not report that you were going home?</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> I just thought that I am sneaking out to go and sleep, and I will quickly coming back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did anyone see you leaving?  There were many people there I suppose?</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> Yes, there were many people, Defence, with other people of the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, but did anyone see you leave?</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> The person who saw me was one of the civilians in F because I passed by their house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And could any other member of the SDU who wanted to do what you did, have done that just go home and sleep?</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> I wouldn't know that much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, if you are able to do it, is there any reason why the others could not have done that?  Did you get the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> I heard your question, I am still thinking.  I suppose no, I wouldn't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, I mean you were present at the scene and you were able to go home, sleep until the afternoon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And thereby avoid going to the veld where the persons were killed.  Is there anything which could have prevented the other members of the SDU from doing what you did - simple go home, sleep until the afternoon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> I wasn't avoiding whether I did not also know whether people will be killed or not.  I was there at the corpse, I thought people would explain it to the community as to what was happening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, in other words you assumed that because they have now been brought to the community, the community will then have to decide what to do with them, your duties as an SDU had come to an end, you can simply go and sleep?</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> I had to go and sleep because it was in the morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> There was nothing which - the other members of the SDU's could have done the same, couldn't they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> Some had to keep guard, they had to be there.  It wasn't easy for them because there was another group that was released at night to go and sleep.</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I understand that, you see you told us that as far as you understood the situation, because the people had been brought to the community, the community was then to decide their fate, you were free to go and sleep, that is what you told us, right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So I am saying, any other member of the SDU could have done the same, they could have gone to their respective homes and slept the rest of the day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  Were you aware of a rumour that the members of the ANC Youth League were out to kill members of the SDU?</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> That they left their ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> They were planning on killing members of the SDU?</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> I wouldn't confirm that because we are still trying to arrange meetings where we could discuss these matters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, but did you hear the rumour though that members of the ANC Youth League ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> The rumours, yes, I heard them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That they wanted to kill the members of the SDU?</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What steps if any, were taken by the members of the SDU to protect themselves against such a planned killing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> We did not try to protect ourselves, all that we did was to write a letter, we send Vuzi Mthembu to write a letter to them so we arranged a meeting and we discussed this matter, but that was to no avail.</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Blanko was a member of the SDU?</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> That is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Bulelwa would sympathise with the SDU?</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> She was the community member and the street committee in the Civic.</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did she sympathise with the SDU?</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> This is how Civic is structured in the SDU.</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I am not talking about the Civic, I am talking about Bulelwa.  Did she sympathise with the SDU?</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> Yes, she liked SDU.</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now, the killing of Blanko who was a member of the SDU, did it not suggest to you that the ANC Youth League was now carrying out their plan of action to kill SDU members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> It was so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTATA:</span> Mr Ndabe, comrade Motlokwa recognised at least one person, that is Tusaneng who were attacking the house of Blanko, would I be right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> No, he said Tusaneng and Vips are the ones that he saw.  Otherwise they were quite many in number.</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTATA:</span> Yes, that is what I am saying, and did he tell you about the looting of tuckshop of Blanko?</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> He only told us about the shooting and we heard as well and we ran in the opposite direction, and at the time when we were running towards Blanko, that is when Nxeba Sonti was there as well, we found that their house was burning fiercely and Blanko was sitting on the chair, helplessly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTATA:</span> You mentioned in your evidence that you met members of the Youth League with cartons of cigarettes, did I hear you correctly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> Yes.  They did not meet with me, or I did not meet them, but the man that left first in the company of Oscar, following the car that was going to fetch the corpse, then they met because he told us that those boys were coming out from another shack and shooting and insulting and they chased after them and they went to this tall grass and this boys now appeared with the cigarettes in their possession, and tin stuff.</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTATA:</span> Now, whilst you were told about the tin stuff and the cigarette cartons, wouldn't you say they are the same even if obtained from any other shop?</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> Yes, they are the same.</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTATA:</span> But your comrades, the SDU's did they use this finding of tin stuff and cigarette cartons that these were part of Blanko's merchandise?</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> It is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTATA:</span> Because you know I want an explanation, I don't understand this that up to you, nobody has mentioned that Blanko's tuckshop was looted but there was merely a suggestion, but nobody said he saw it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a>	They said that came from Blanko's shop because when they killed him, that for instance we saw Tusaneng, for instance, because this is a person we all know was positively identified that we sat Tusaneng helping himself to the merchandise, but when people are met with some tin stuff and all that, then some conclusion is made that these are the people who had attacked Blanko and taken some of his stock.  Could you probably shed some light that we understand the whole thing that happened the 6th of December 1993, are you able to do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> I am certain that the tuckshop that they attacked, had tin stuff, although I am not sure as to how much stock there was, since Blanko was so helpful in the community of F as far as food is concerned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a>	When you got there to the tuckshop the shelves were empty suddenly, the fridge itself was empty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTATA:</span> Thank you Mr Ndabe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> When I asked you about this Pinky you gave the indication or you left the impression that you know the Pinky who was with Bulelwa when she was shot, did you know her well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> No.  Even Bulelwa herself, I did not know her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Do you know the Pinky that was with Bulelwa when she was shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> How do you know that it is not the same Pinky?</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> The one that I am talking about is younger and is this mother's child, it is a school child.</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Okay, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes Mr Madasa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">RE-EXAMINATION BY MR MADASA:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Ndabe, is it correct that the SDU procedure during patrols was that you would have shifts, day and night shifts?</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> And is it correct therefore that people who were doing night shift were expected to go home?</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Wait a minute, doing night shift where?  We know that the patrols were conducted during the day and at night.  Are you suggesting that individuals who worked the night shift in their places of employment ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> The SDU Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is it the SDU would patrol during the day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> I am suggesting that the SDU members who were doing night patrol or night duty in the SDU activity, were expected, yes who patrolled.  By patrolling Mr Chairman, I include for example looking after Bulelwa's corpse through out the night, that was patrolling.</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I understand that but I wanted to make sure that I understand the question is whether - you are talking about a patrol that members of the SDU who would patrol during the day are allowed to rest in the evening and those who patrol during the night, are allowed to rest during the day, subject to the whistle blowing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a>	Did you hear the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> I did not follow.</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> The question is SDU members who did the day shift, were expected to rest at night and those who did night shift were expected to rest during the day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> That is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Subject to emergencies?</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> On that day when you responded to the whistle, you have told us that you looked after Bulelwa's body through out the night, is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> Yes, that is so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Were you therefore expected to rest afterwards during the day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> Yes, I was expected to go and rest.</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Would members who had not done the night shift, be expected to rest as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">MR NDABE:</span> It was expected for them to be on duty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>

<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> In December 1993, did you live at Muleleki?</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Which Block and Extension?</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> Block F, Extension 2.</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Were you working in December 1993?</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> No, I was unemployed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> The SDU - you were a patroller and an operator?</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> I was a patroller.</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> In the killings of December 1993, which we are talking about here, tell us about the role that you played, if you did participate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> Yes, I played a role.</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Tell us about what you did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> In the morning we were sent by Comrade Commander Nxeba Ndondolo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Where were you when he sent you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> We were at Bulelwa's corpse.</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Tell us how did it come about that you went to Bulelwa's body?  Start from there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> On my arrival ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Why did you go to her body?</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> Let me just go back a little bit.  On the 6th at round about eight o'clock, we heard gun fire.  As we were surprised we heard a whistle being blown.</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a>	I then left as a member of the Self Defence Unit, carried my stick and brought my blanket along, rushing to the scene where the whistle was being blown.</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a>	On my arrival I found some comrades even though I did not see them all.  I went to the place where the whistle was being blown, that was Block F.</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> On arrival I found some comrades and a corpse laying on the road, a female corpse.</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> There was also comrade Buthelezi who said to me comrade, we don't want a person wearing a blanket here.  I did not object to that and when I went back, there were two of us comrades wearing blankets.</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Who were those whom you met?</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> It was comrade Matabela.</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> I went back to my place and continued to sleep.</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> I slept and in the morning I woke up, went back to the place where neighbours were rushing to.   I found that the corpse that was laying there yesterday, was still there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> The whole community had gathered there, discussing this issue.  I then heard that there is also another one who was shot at night in Block E.</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> I then went to Block E to see what damage had been caused there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> On arrival there was a comrade who was burnt in the house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Who was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> He was sitting on a chair and that was comrade Blanko.</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> I then heard people saying he was killed by the Youth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> I went back to Block F to Bulelwa's corpse.  As I was still standing there, comrade Shongwe and Lefu came to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Shongwe and who?</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> Comrade Shongwe and Lefu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that Lefu Mokoena?</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> And they said comrade Ndondolo instructed us to go and fetch another boy who is alleged to be involved.  There are questions that he wanted to pose to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a>	We then left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Where did you go?</p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> We went to Block D.</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> On arrival we asked and we found his mother and his sister, that is Mavuso.  His mother said yes, he is here, he is asleep.  We indicated that we were sent by comrade Commander because he wanted to ask him questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> We then woke him up and he did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Did you go to where he was sleeping to wake him up yourselves?</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> We went back to Bulelwa's corpse.  When we arrived there, it was indicated to the community that this is the person and it was indicated that we should take him to the shack, and this instruction came from comrade Commander.</p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Is that the first shack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> Yes, that is the first one, the one that was nearer to Bulelwa's corpse.</p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> I then went to the community and attended the meeting that was being held there.  Here I think I will stop.</p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Did you go to the place where they were killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> No, I didn't sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> What was the community talking about near Bulelwa's body?</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> The community was discussing crime and violence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> How was the mood of the community members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> The mood was tense.</p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Can you estimate how many people were there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> I can estimate them to be in excess of 100.</p>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Do you know from which area they came?</p>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> Those that I knew, were from Block F, but certainly the people there were not only from Block F.</p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Was that meeting a formal meeting, chaired or was it informal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> The meeting had proceeded when I arrived there, and therefore I do not know who chaired the meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Was there anything at that meeting said about the death of Blanko and Bulelwa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> No, I didn't hear anything to that effect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Were their deaths the subject of that meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> What I still remember is that they had long been waiting for the Peace Committee vehicle, and it hadn't shown up because the corpse had been laying there since the previous night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Why were you involved in removing Mavuso from his home?</p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> I followed the instructions that comrade Commander gave to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Was that your duty in the SDU?</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> Yes, it is part of my duty that I carry out what instructions he gave me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> SDU was maintaining peace within the community, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Was the removal of Mavuso part of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> Yes, I can say so sir because even when I say when I arrived there, the meeting had already proceeded, I heard that the community was complaining that someone had been shot at night, and now other comrades had indicated that Mavuso is also part of what happened the previous night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Did you benefit anything from your participation in this matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> There is nothing that I benefitted from this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> I have no further questions Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a><span class="speaker">NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MADASA:</span> .</p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mapoma?</p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Thank you Chairperson.  The meeting that you are talking about, is it a meeting that was addressed by Mashinini?</p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> I would not so no comrade, because I don't even know Mashinini, whether he was there or not, I have never seen him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> And the meeting you are talking about, was it a meeting nearby Bulelwa's corpse?</p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> Yes, that is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Did you attend any meeting at Blanko's place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> No, I didn't stay at Blanko's place.  I just went there to establish the damage and then I went back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Thank you, no further questions Judge Ngcobo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Sibanyoni?</p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.  Mr Mtshali, it would seem the meeting we are talking about, in actual fact was not a meeting, but it was the people who had gathered there after hearing a whistle being blown, am I correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> In other words there was no specific Chairperson, specific speakers who were addressing the people, only some SDU members addressed the people who had gathered there to pay their respects?</p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> I would ask the Chairperson to indicate exactly which meeting is he talking about.  The one at Bulelwa's place or Bulelwa's body or something else, another meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> The one at Bulelwa's place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> I have already explained that in the first day we were sent away and I went back to sleep.   On the second day I came back and they were discussing the fact that they were waiting for the Peace Committee vehicle for a very long time, and it had now shown up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Mr Mtshali, I heard you saying you followed the instructions which were given by the Commander, but now when you look back and look at the deeds which you committed, people have lost their dear ones, children have lost their parents, is there anything you would like to say in that regard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> There is nothing that I would like to say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Are you saying you are not sorry for what happened, you don't have any remorse over what you did?</p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> Yes, I feel remorse.</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Thank you, no further questions Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr Mtshali, you said that you got the instructions from the Commander to go and fetch Mavuso to answer to questions.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Then you said when you arrived, you went back to the corpse, and when you arrived it was indicated to the community that this is the person, and then he was taken to the shack and then you went back to the community and attended the meeting that was being held there, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> My question is whether you were present when any questions were asked of Mavuso?  Did the Commander ask questions of Mavuso?</p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> He presented Mr Mavuso to the public and on doing so, he indicated that the boys from the shack said Mavuso was also part of it.  I was not there when he was being questioned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You were still there when he was taken to the shack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> Yes, I was there when he was taken to the shack, but I then went back to the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So while you were there, Mavuso did not address the community?</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> I don't remember him talking.</p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> May I take you to another meeting in Block F.  You heard the evidence of some of your co-applicants, your comrades, that a new SDU was to be established in Block F, some time before this incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> Yes, I know about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did you attend that meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did the community accept the new SDU?</p>
<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> It was said this SDU was going to be in charge of Block F.  But those who were present said they were not enough SDU members in Block F, and therefore they need their own Self Defence Unit because Block F is facing Zonkezizwe which place is an Inkatha area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And those present, agreed to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> Yes, they did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did anyone object?</p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> No one objected to this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Everybody was happy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> I wouldn't say, but I never heard any objection.</p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> From no one?  Did no one object?</p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> No one objected sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Was Bulelwa there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> Yes, she was there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did she object?</p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> She was told to keep quiet.  When it was time for them to indicate to the community that every household should donate R50-00 to buy shovels.</p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did she object to the R50-00 or what did she object to, why was she told to keep quiet, what did she say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line546"><a name="pos546"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> She said that it is not possible for another Self Defence Unit to be formed when there is already one existing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr Mtshali, did you hear her say that or did you hear that in evidence from someone else who sat here yesterday and during the week?</p>
<p class="line" id="line548"><a name="pos548"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> I personally heard her say that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Would that not have been construed as an objection?</p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> Those who were at the meeting showed not to be in agreement with what she was saying and it transpired that she was, yes, objecting to what had already been said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> How old was Bulelwa, do you have any idea?</p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> I would say she was somewhere around 22 years.</p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Was she also Youth League?</p>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> Even though I cannot be sure, it looks like she was not a member of the Youth League.</p>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But you are not sure?</p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Was she an enemy to the Youth League?</p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> I am not sure about that Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> No further questions thank you, Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Motata?</p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTATA:</span> Thank you Chairperson.  Mr Mtshali, I just want to know the number that is how many members comprised the SDU and in this respect, let's just confine ourselves to those who were patrolling Muleleki Section as a whole A to E or F, how many members, how many were you in the SDU?</p>
<p class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> There were many of us Mr Chairperson.   I can estimate to around 45 upwards.</p>
<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTATA:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson, I've got no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You told us that when you first arrived at the spot where Bulelwa's body was laying, you were told that people with blankets were not welcomed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> That is correct yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line566"><a name="pos566"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you said Buthelezi said this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line568"><a name="pos568"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is this Buthelezi who was subsequently killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line570"><a name="pos570"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you know why Buthelezi would have said that people with blankets are not welcomed there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> Yes, I know Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> It is because he was not part of the ANC struggle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you saying that he was not a full member of the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> Yes, that is correct.  He was not a full member of the ANC.  Will you please repeat your question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He was not a full member of the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why do you say that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> It is because one day there was a truck, a paraffin truck that was hijacked by the Youth and they took this truck to a place between Block F and Block E.</p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a>	And when I got out of the house, I saw the community running with buckets, water buckets and plastic water containers.  When I rushed there to establish what was happening, I saw on the tar road separating Block F and Block E, I saw this truck and that is where the community had gathered.</p>
<p class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a>	The route came from comrade Buthelezi.  He too was standing outside in the street.  When I went to him, that is when I could actually see what this truck was all about.  I then said to comrade, when I realised that people were pushing that, I realised that people were differing on this thing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a>	When I got there, it was a paraffin truck.  I then asked him is it the right thing to do and he said this thing belongs to the Boers, you don't have to worry.  I then went back into the house.  	That is why I got assurance that he was not an ANC member because he was supposed to call the youth to order when they made mistakes, because that paraffin was going to help us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Any other reason why you suggested that Buthelezi wasn't a full member of the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> Yes, I do have another reason.  That refers to the formation of the Self Defence Unit when there was one already in existence.  This is also something that I concluded will create a problem in the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line585"><a name="pos585"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> (Indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line586"><a name="pos586"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> No, I don't have any other reason Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> As I understand from you, the decision to form the new SDU was taken by the residents of F Section, because I gathered from you that there weren't many members of the SDU there?  Is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line588"><a name="pos588"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line589"><a name="pos589"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you therefore consider the other residents of Block F who decided to form the new SDU, not to be full members of the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> They were members of the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Notwithstanding the fact that they had decided to form a new SDU?</p>
<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> They were instructed by Buthelezi because these were his ideas of forming the new SDU.  I would say they agreed to being forced to submit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line593"><a name="pos593"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were there many members of the SDU at Block F?</p>
<p class="line" id="line594"><a name="pos594"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> There were two SDU members in Block F, among those who have applied here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were those two members enough to patrol the whole of Block F?</p>

<p class="line" id="line613"><a name="pos613"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> There people were talking about the unrest and crime?</p>

<p class="line" id="line618"><a name="pos618"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line619"><a name="pos619"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What was the suggestion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line620"><a name="pos620"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> It was said the Youth was involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line621"><a name="pos621"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you returned to the spot where Bulelwa was, you were not longer wearing the blanket, were you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line622"><a name="pos622"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> I still had my blanket on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line623"><a name="pos623"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What made you to go, to leave the spot in the first place?  Well, you told us that when you arrived there Buthelezi said that people who were wearing blankets were not welcomed here and you left, right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line624"><a name="pos624"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line625"><a name="pos625"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But you returned later wearing the same blanket?</p>
<p class="line" id="line626"><a name="pos626"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line627"><a name="pos627"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why did you leave in the first place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line628"><a name="pos628"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> I came back the following day Chairperson, seeing other comrades who were wearing blankets there as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line629"><a name="pos629"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was there any suggestion at all that Bulelwa had been killed by the members of the SDU?</p>
<p class="line" id="line630"><a name="pos630"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> I did not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line631"><a name="pos631"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is it that you did not know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line632"><a name="pos632"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> I did not know that Bulelwa was killed by the SDU members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line633"><a name="pos633"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> There were rumours and talks, are there rumours that you came across to the effect that Bulelwa was killed by SDU comrades?  Is there any reason why you did not go to the veld where the people were killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line634"><a name="pos634"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> There is no reason Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line635"><a name="pos635"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Before you left, did you say that you from where you had been, that is at the spot where Bulelwa's body was, you returned to your house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line636"><a name="pos636"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> Yes, that is correct.  When the corpse was being taken shortly after the car had arrived to pick the corpse up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line637"><a name="pos637"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When the body was removed, were the deceased still in the shacks, locked up in the shacks?</p>
<p class="line" id="line638"><a name="pos638"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> Which deceased are you referring to Chairperson?  The children who were killed in the veld, yes, I would say so even though I was not there personally, I was in the community, guarding over Bulelwa's body.</p>
<p class="line" id="line639"><a name="pos639"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you see the deceased being removed from this shack to another shack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line640"><a name="pos640"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> No, I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line641"><a name="pos641"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you know what was going to happen to these persons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line642"><a name="pos642"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line643"><a name="pos643"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you ever think what was going to happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line644"><a name="pos644"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> No, I did not because I did not know what decision the Commander will take.</p>
<p class="line" id="line645"><a name="pos645"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> As a member of the SDU, did you consider it necessary that you must be present to hear what the Commander was going to say often concerning the fate of these individuals?</p>
<p class="line" id="line646"><a name="pos646"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> Yes, I did but the Commander did not instruct me to be part of the group that left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line647"><a name="pos647"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you expect the Commander to call you to come?</p>
<p class="line" id="line648"><a name="pos648"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> Yes, that is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line649"><a name="pos649"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were the people who went with the deceased to the veld, called by the Commander?</p>
<p class="line" id="line650"><a name="pos650"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> Yes, I would say so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line651"><a name="pos651"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did he call them by their names?</p>
<p class="line" id="line652"><a name="pos652"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> I am not sure about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line653"><a name="pos653"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you present when he called them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line654"><a name="pos654"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> No, I was not present, that is why I am saying how he actually called them, because I was not present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line655"><a name="pos655"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How do you know that they were called by him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line656"><a name="pos656"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> He is the one who was in charge of the organisation, he was the one who was making orders.</p>
<p class="line" id="line657"><a name="pos657"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But you see as I understand your evidence, you said that the people who went there, were people who were called by the Commander to go there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line658"><a name="pos658"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line659"><a name="pos659"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But you didn't go there because the Commander didn't call you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line660"><a name="pos660"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line661"><a name="pos661"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And I am asking you how do you know  that these are the persons - were called by the Commander to go to the place where the deceased were killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line662"><a name="pos662"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> I have already indicated that I am not sure because I was not present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line663"><a name="pos663"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Before you left, did you tell the Commander that you were now leaving?</p>
<p class="line" id="line664"><a name="pos664"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> No, I did not tell him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line665"><a name="pos665"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How was the Commander going to find you, if you leave without you telling him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line666"><a name="pos666"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> It is because he was not at Bulelwa's corpse.  I went back to my place when the community started dispersing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line667"><a name="pos667"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, I understand that.  You expected that the Commander would call you, but how was he going to call you if you leave without telling him that you are now going to your house as a member of the SDU?</p>
<p class="line" id="line668"><a name="pos668"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> Would you please repeat your question Mr Chairperson?</p>
<p class="line" id="line669"><a name="pos669"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You were a member of the SDU, you were waiting for the Commander Nxeba Ndondolo to give an instruction to go to the veld with the rest?</p>
<p class="line" id="line670"><a name="pos670"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line671"><a name="pos671"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What I am asking you now is because you had just left without informing him that you were now leaving, I am now leaving, going back home, how was he supposed to know where you were if he wanted to use you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line672"><a name="pos672"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> He did not know where I resided.</p>
<p class="line" id="line673"><a name="pos673"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Madasa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line674"><a name="pos674"></a><span class="speaker">RE-EXAMINATION BY MR MADASA:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  In the SDU, was a member required to patrol the area where he was living in or would a member patrol even other Blocks where he did not live?</p>
<p class="line" id="line675"><a name="pos675"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> A member would not patrol in an area where they did not reside, they patrolled all the Blocks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line676"><a name="pos676"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> So at the time Buthelezi called that meeting, Block F was patrolled but not by members of F Block?</p>
<p class="line" id="line677"><a name="pos677"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> Yes, that is correct.  It was being patrolled by members of the Self Defence Unit, the one that patrolled Muleleki, the whole of Muleleki.  Such that this is how I realised that there was going to be conflict if another SDU is formed where there is this one existing already.</p>
<p class="line" id="line678"><a name="pos678"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> So Buthelezi wanted  F people to patrol F Block?</p>
<p class="line" id="line679"><a name="pos679"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line680"><a name="pos680"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Which was not policy of the SDU?  That was not the policy of the SDU?</p>
<p class="line" id="line681"><a name="pos681"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line682"><a name="pos682"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> And then you say but the SDU members who lived in F, were few, it was only you and another person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line683"><a name="pos683"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line684"><a name="pos684"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line685"><a name="pos685"></a><span class="speaker">NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MADASA:</span> .</p>
<p class="line" id="line686"><a name="pos686"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You were in Block F, but you didn't patrol Block F, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line687"><a name="pos687"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> Yes, I was in Block F, but I was patrolling the whole 6, including Block F.</p>
<p class="line" id="line688"><a name="pos688"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Including Block F?</p>
<p class="line" id="line689"><a name="pos689"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line690"><a name="pos690"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You mentioned I think it is that there were approximately 45 members of the SDU?</p>
<p class="line" id="line691"><a name="pos691"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line692"><a name="pos692"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Of this 45, only two stayed in Block F?</p>
<p class="line" id="line693"><a name="pos693"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line694"><a name="pos694"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line695"><a name="pos695"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> No questions Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line696"><a name="pos696"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you.  Mr Mtshali, you may return to your seat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line697"><a name="pos697"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> I don't know Chairperson, whether I can have my request.</p>
<p class="line" id="line698"><a name="pos698"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you want to discuss that with your counsel first?</p>
<p class="line" id="line699"><a name="pos699"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> No.  I can also present this here if you can give me the right to show.</p>
<p class="line" id="line700"><a name="pos700"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line701"><a name="pos701"></a><span class="speaker">MR MTSHALI:</span> Thank you Chairperson.  I would request families of those who lost their children, please forgive me.  I did not like what happened.  The members of the Self Defence Units did not like this, we are therefore applying for amnesty.  We will meet with our counsel so that we can meet with the next of kin, especially the women, Mavuso's mother in particular.  Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line702"><a name="pos702"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you Mr Mtshali.  You may return to your seat.</p>

<p class="line" id="line745"><a name="pos745"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> We stayed in the same Block, Block F.  She was a member of the street committee at that time in our street.  Maybe I am mistaken at the moment, perhaps the street next to ours, maybe not our street per se but maybe the next street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line746"><a name="pos746"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> As far as you know, did he have a good relationship with the SDU?</p>
<p class="line" id="line747"><a name="pos747"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> She had no problem with the SDU, they were just people to her, members of the community.  Even with the Youth League, I wouldn't say she had a problem.  It is just that I am not sure about the members of the Youth League, therefore I can't really say that she had a problem with the Youth League.</p>
<p class="line" id="line748"><a name="pos748"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> You are aware that Bulelwa was killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line749"><a name="pos749"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> Yes, I am aware.</p>
<p class="line" id="line750"><a name="pos750"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> The day before she was killed, is there anything - was there any meeting called by the Youth League if he there has, tell us about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line751"><a name="pos751"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> Yes, there was a meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line752"><a name="pos752"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Firstly, how do you know that the Youth League called a meeting on that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line753"><a name="pos753"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> Two comrades came to my house, members of the Youth League, they wanted Nomfundu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line754"><a name="pos754"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes?  Sorry, do you know their names?</p>
<p class="line" id="line755"><a name="pos755"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> The comrades?</p>
<p class="line" id="line756"><a name="pos756"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line757"><a name="pos757"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> No, I do not know them.  When they arrived, they asked where Nomfundu was.  I told them that she went to Nxlapo Section where she was visiting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line758"><a name="pos758"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line759"><a name="pos759"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> They left a message for me to tell her that there was a meeting at eight o'clock at a place where we called the FNB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line760"><a name="pos760"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line761"><a name="pos761"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> On the Sunday, they came back at about three o'clock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line762"><a name="pos762"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line763"><a name="pos763"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> Fortunately that is when Nomfundu arrived, coming from Nxlapo.  They spoke to her outside, because that is where they met each other.</p>
<p class="line" id="line764"><a name="pos764"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line765"><a name="pos765"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> As she was going inside, I asked her if she had gotten her message that there was going to be a meeting.  She said yes, there was going to be a meeting at eight o'clock in the evening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line766"><a name="pos766"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line767"><a name="pos767"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> In the evening Nomfundu prepared to go to the meeting.   After about 15 minutes after she left, she came back.  15 Minutes elapsed after she had left, and she came back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line768"><a name="pos768"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line769"><a name="pos769"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> When I asked her how the meeting was, she said she did not know what was going on, she said she was asked to go home and wear her tracksuit and tackies.</p>
<p class="line" id="line770"><a name="pos770"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line771"><a name="pos771"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> When I wanted to know exactly what was going on, she said that the SDU had called them to Block E.</p>
<p class="line" id="line772"><a name="pos772"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line773"><a name="pos773"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> I said to her as she was not the only female member of the Youth League, I asked her to stay at home and lock the door, she must only open for me I said.  I said I am going to a lady who has children who are members of the Youth League.</p>
<p class="line" id="line774"><a name="pos774"></a>	I didn't understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line775"><a name="pos775"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> What did you say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line776"><a name="pos776"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> I said I am going to a lady who has children who were also members of the ANC Youth League.</p>
<p class="line" id="line777"><a name="pos777"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line778"><a name="pos778"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> I got to this lady, I said to her I was actually looking for her daughters.  I said to them that my sister could not go with them, I had a problem because it was at night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line779"><a name="pos779"></a>	When I got there there was a group of men, when I was about to knock at the door, they ran away.  It was the Youth League.</p>
<p class="line" id="line780"><a name="pos780"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line781"><a name="pos781"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> I went inside, I told this lady that my sister could not go to this meeting because it was at night, and she was a girl.</p>
<p class="line" id="line782"><a name="pos782"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line783"><a name="pos783"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> Whilst I was speaking to this lady, a certain young man knocked on the door.</p>
<p class="line" id="line784"><a name="pos784"></a>	He asked for a key from this lady.  I saw this young man, I don't know if I should divulge his name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line785"><a name="pos785"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes please do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line786"><a name="pos786"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> It was Buthelezi's son, Thokozani.</p>
<p class="line" id="line787"><a name="pos787"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line788"><a name="pos788"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> This lady gave him the key.  After I had spoken to this lady, I then said I am leaving.  On the way back home, I came across these young men.</p>
<p class="line" id="line789"><a name="pos789"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line790"><a name="pos790"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> Something shocked me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line791"><a name="pos791"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> What was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line792"><a name="pos792"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> One of them said I told you that you were hurrying this thing up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line793"><a name="pos793"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line794"><a name="pos794"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> I greeted them, after I did that, I asked them what is going on here men, I said.  They said no Ma'am, nothing is going on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line795"><a name="pos795"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Were there any girls amongst them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line796"><a name="pos796"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> No, it was just young men.</p>
<p class="line" id="line797"><a name="pos797"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line798"><a name="pos798"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> I then proceeded on my way home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line799"><a name="pos799"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line800"><a name="pos800"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> I got there and I slept.</p>
<p class="line" id="line801"><a name="pos801"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Did Nomfundu go to the meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line802"><a name="pos802"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> No, she did not go.</p>
<p class="line" id="line803"><a name="pos803"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> And then the following day was Bulelwa's death?</p>
<p class="line" id="line804"><a name="pos804"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> In the morning the next day, I just heard a noise.  Somebody then knocked on my door after the noise.</p>
<p class="line" id="line805"><a name="pos805"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> (Indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line806"><a name="pos806"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> Yes sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line807"><a name="pos807"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line808"><a name="pos808"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> This lady asked me if I had heard that the gun shots that were fired the previous night, they were used on Bulelwa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line809"><a name="pos809"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line810"><a name="pos810"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> After I heard I left to go to the other women that were on my street, I told them that we should go and see where Bulelwa was killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line811"><a name="pos811"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Did you go to see?</p>
<p class="line" id="line812"><a name="pos812"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> Yes, I did go.  Her corpse was there on the road, but it was covered.  There were men standing around.</p>
<p class="line" id="line813"><a name="pos813"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Did the community gather there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line814"><a name="pos814"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> Yes, the community did gather.  Not a lot of people, there was not even 100 people, just a group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line815"><a name="pos815"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Did you remain there at Bulelwa's corpse?</p>
<p class="line" id="line816"><a name="pos816"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> We stood there, listened.  There were already some comrades there.  I remember that we spoke to comrade Buthelezi.  He said that we have found Bulelwa's corpse.</p>
<p class="line" id="line817"><a name="pos817"></a>	He said that they had not slept the whole night, just looking over the corpse.</p>
<p class="line" id="line818"><a name="pos818"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line819"><a name="pos819"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> After that, we went back home because I was preparing to go to work.</p>
<p class="line" id="line820"><a name="pos820"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Do you know of the meeting that was called by Buthelezi at F?</p>
<p class="line" id="line821"><a name="pos821"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> I don't know what the meeting was about because he called a lot of meetings as he ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line822"><a name="pos822"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Okay, let me ask you this, do you know Buthelezi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line823"><a name="pos823"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line824"><a name="pos824"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Did he belong to any organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line825"><a name="pos825"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> He was a member of the Block, Block F.</p>
<p class="line" id="line826"><a name="pos826"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Did he belong to a political organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line827"><a name="pos827"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> I wouldn't know, I wasn't used to the man.</p>
<p class="line" id="line828"><a name="pos828"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Do you know that a meeting was called to form a new SDU for Block F by Buthelezi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line829"><a name="pos829"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> Yes, I am aware.</p>
<p class="line" id="line830"><a name="pos830"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Did you go to that meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line831"><a name="pos831"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> I was present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line832"><a name="pos832"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Was Bulelwa at that meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line833"><a name="pos833"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> She was present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line834"><a name="pos834"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Were you told why the meeting was called?</p>
<p class="line" id="line835"><a name="pos835"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> We were told that a new SDU was going to be formed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line836"><a name="pos836"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Who told you that, who called the meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line837"><a name="pos837"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> I couldn't be sure about that, I don't know who the Chairperson of the meeting was, however comrade Buthelezi is one of the people who said that this meeting has been called, because they were going to form a new SDU.</p>
<p class="line" id="line838"><a name="pos838"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Did Bulelwa talk at that meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line839"><a name="pos839"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> Yes, she spoke.</p>
<p class="line" id="line840"><a name="pos840"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> What did she say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line841"><a name="pos841"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> She asked if it was important for a new SDU to be formed where there was a SDU existing at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line842"><a name="pos842"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line843"><a name="pos843"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> I am not sure how she answered.</p>
<p class="line" id="line844"><a name="pos844"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Was money collected at that meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line845"><a name="pos845"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> No, money was not collected, however, R50-00 per house was meant to be collected.</p>
<p class="line" id="line846"><a name="pos846"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Had Bulelwa asked why is it necessary to form a new SDU when there was one in existence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line847"><a name="pos847"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> Yes, I heard her ask that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line848"><a name="pos848"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Did anyone respond to her question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line849"><a name="pos849"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> Certainly there should have been somebody who answered.  However, I was not interested in listening to the answer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line850"><a name="pos850"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> What did you do after the question, did you leave the meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line851"><a name="pos851"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> I did not leave the meeting, but I was not interested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line852"><a name="pos852"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Why did you loose interest in the matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line853"><a name="pos853"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> The reason why I lost interest, is because a new SDU was going to be formed, meanwhile there was one in existence.  Also I was not happy about the fact that we had to pop out R50-00 each house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line854"><a name="pos854"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Did you want the new SDU to be formed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line855"><a name="pos855"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> I was not interested in the new SDU.</p>
<p class="line" id="line856"><a name="pos856"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Were you not interested to know why it was necessary to form a new SDU?</p>
<p class="line" id="line857"><a name="pos857"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> The reason why I was not interested in the reasoning, is because I stayed with someone who was a member of the ANC Youth League.  The reason why I was unhappy was because I found out that they wanted to also use girls in this new SDU that they were forming.</p>
<p class="line" id="line858"><a name="pos858"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> At what stage of meeting did you hear that the purpose of the meeting was to form a new SDU?</p>
<p class="line" id="line859"><a name="pos859"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> Could you repeat the question please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line860"><a name="pos860"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> At what stage did you hear that the purpose of the meeting was to form the new SDU?</p>
<p class="line" id="line861"><a name="pos861"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> After they had already said, however I had already heard that the ANC Youth League wanted to form a new SDU because they were saying that their parents were being attacked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line862"><a name="pos862"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So before you went to the meeting, you knew that the meeting was going to be about the forming of a new SDU?</p>
<p class="line" id="line863"><a name="pos863"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> As I have already said, I stayed with someone who was a member of the ANC Youth League.  She would complain to me of some things, she would tell me that she is a member of the ANC Youth League but she did not know what was going on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line864"><a name="pos864"></a>	She was not clear of what was going on.  However, I later found out that they used to hide information from her because the ANC Youth League said I am quite close to the SDU.</p>
<p class="line" id="line865"><a name="pos865"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Prior to going to the meeting, did you know that the meeting was going to discuss the formation of a new SDU?</p>
<p class="line" id="line866"><a name="pos866"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> I was not clear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line867"><a name="pos867"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You only learnt that for the first time at the meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line868"><a name="pos868"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> I could put it like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line869"><a name="pos869"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You nevertheless continued to remain at the meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line870"><a name="pos870"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> I did not stay until the end of the meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line871"><a name="pos871"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You were present when Bulelwa asked why it was necessary to form a new SDU?</p>
<p class="line" id="line872"><a name="pos872"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> I was present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line873"><a name="pos873"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> After she had asked the question, you then suddenly lost interest in the meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line874"><a name="pos874"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> I lost interest, I was disinterested from the time they even mentioned that they were forming a new SDU.</p>
<p class="line" id="line875"><a name="pos875"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You didn't bother to find out why it was necessary to form a new SDU?</p>
<p class="line" id="line876"><a name="pos876"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> I did not ask.</p>
<p class="line" id="line877"><a name="pos877"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> You yourself was not in favour of the formation of the new SDU?</p>
<p class="line" id="line878"><a name="pos878"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> I did not agree with that because I knew that there was a SDU already in existence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line879"><a name="pos879"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> You were not in favour of the formation of the new SDU?</p>
<p class="line" id="line880"><a name="pos880"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> I was not in favour.</p>
<p class="line" id="line881"><a name="pos881"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Was the community supportive of the new formation of the SDU?</p>
<p class="line" id="line882"><a name="pos882"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> No, they did not support that idea.  However ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line883"><a name="pos883"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you hear anyone at the meeting speaking in favour of the formation of the SDU?</p>
<p class="line" id="line884"><a name="pos884"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> Nobody.</p>
<p class="line" id="line885"><a name="pos885"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> This different view that you are talking about, what are they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line886"><a name="pos886"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> In a meeting everybody views, or everybody says what they think, gives their viewpoint.</p>
<p class="line" id="line887"><a name="pos887"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Then how do you know that the people were not in favour of the establishment of the new SDU?</p>
<p class="line" id="line888"><a name="pos888"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Sorry Mr Chairman, the witness with due respect has told the Committee that at that meeting there was division as to the formation of the new SDU, that is what she said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line889"><a name="pos889"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But she said no one spoke against that, no one spoke in favour of the SDU?</p>
<p class="line" id="line890"><a name="pos890"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> She said there was division amongst the people who attended.</p>
<p class="line" id="line891"><a name="pos891"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I want to know what division, what were the people saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line892"><a name="pos892"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> What were the people saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line893"><a name="pos893"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> Some of the people were against the SDU, as Bulelwa said or asked if it was necessary to form a new SDU, she asked if this was not going to cause conflict.</p>
<p class="line" id="line894"><a name="pos894"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> I have no further questions Your Worship.</p>
<p class="line" id="line895"><a name="pos895"></a><span class="speaker">NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MADASA:</span> .</p>
<p class="line" id="line896"><a name="pos896"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, Mr Mapoma?</p>
<p class="line" id="line897"><a name="pos897"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Thank you Chairperson.  Ms Ndwane, is it correct that Bulelwa and Buthelezi were staying in Block F?</p>
<p class="line" id="line898"><a name="pos898"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line899"><a name="pos899"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> And both of them were leaders in the community structures in Block F?</p>
<p class="line" id="line900"><a name="pos900"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line901"><a name="pos901"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Now in that meeting that you are talking about, was there at any stage where some people were not allowed to talk because they are women?</p>
<p class="line" id="line902"><a name="pos902"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> I am not sure about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line903"><a name="pos903"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Thank you, no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line904"><a name="pos904"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Sibanyoni?</p>
<p class="line" id="line905"><a name="pos905"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.  Mr Ndwane, where is this Nomfundu Ndwane today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line906"><a name="pos906"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> She is around, but not here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line907"><a name="pos907"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Not here at the hearings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line908"><a name="pos908"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> No, she is not here in the hall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line909"><a name="pos909"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Where exactly is she?</p>
<p class="line" id="line910"><a name="pos910"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> She is in the township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line911"><a name="pos911"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> And then since when was she a member of the ANC Youth League, when did she become a member of the ANC Youth League?</p>
<p class="line" id="line912"><a name="pos912"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> She became a member of the ANC Youth League after being recruited by other girls who were staying at Block F, who were already members of the ANC Youth League.</p>
<p class="line" id="line913"><a name="pos913"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> And when was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line914"><a name="pos914"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> In 1993, before December.  I can't remember, at the time of this incident, it hadn't been a long time since she had joined.</p>
<p class="line" id="line915"><a name="pos915"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Could it be July or August or September, can you estimate a month?</p>
<p class="line" id="line916"><a name="pos916"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> I think it was around July, but I am not sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line917"><a name="pos917"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> We have heard from applicants that there were generally complaints about the Youth League, the ANC Youth League, among others that the Youth League was hijacking cars, looting tuckshops - were you also aware of that since you were staying with a member of the ANC Youth League?</p>
<p class="line" id="line918"><a name="pos918"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> As I have already said, Nomfundu was not clear of certain issues.  She did not tell me of such.</p>
<p class="line" id="line919"><a name="pos919"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> So you are saying you were not aware that generally in the community you were staying in, people were being killed, cars hijacked and spaza shops looted.  Let me separate my question were you aware of those rumours or were you not aware?</p>
<p class="line" id="line920"><a name="pos920"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> Yes, I have heard such rumours.</p>
<p class="line" id="line921"><a name="pos921"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> You heard them from the community, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line922"><a name="pos922"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line923"><a name="pos923"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Did you also hear that the people who were suspected of those deeds, were members of the ANC Youth League?</p>
<p class="line" id="line924"><a name="pos924"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> I am not sure exactly who was guilty.  We would hear that bakeries are being looted, tuckshops, people had been killed, but nobody ever said that all that was being done by the ANC Youth League.</p>
<p class="line" id="line925"><a name="pos925"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Did you hear about the death of Majosi who was the member of the South African Communist Party?</p>
<p class="line" id="line926"><a name="pos926"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line927"><a name="pos927"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Did you hear that the Youth League apologised for his death?</p>
<p class="line" id="line928"><a name="pos928"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> No.  I did not hear that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line929"><a name="pos929"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Did your sister Nomfundu never discuss the issue with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line930"><a name="pos930"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> As I have already said, Nomfundu would go to the meetings.  She was elected as a Secretary, but she never even had a book for the minutes of the meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line931"><a name="pos931"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> But exactly as a Secretary, she was supposed to be in a better position to know more about the activities of the ANC Youth League than an ordinary member, she was in the Executive.  What is your comment about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line932"><a name="pos932"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> Yes, I agree but she did not like what she was doing.  But as a mother or sort of a mother for her, I said to her she should be a member of the ANC Youth League, because other children were as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line933"><a name="pos933"></a>	I did not particularly see a reason why she shouldn't join the ANC Youth League, so I encouraged her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line934"><a name="pos934"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> I heard you saying that you were suspected or you were regarded as being close to the SDU's, am I correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line935"><a name="pos935"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> Yes, they suspected that I was Nxeba Sonti's sister.  They perceived me as Nxeba Sonti's sister.</p>
<p class="line" id="line936"><a name="pos936"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Were you close to the SDU's?</p>
<p class="line" id="line937"><a name="pos937"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> I was used to them.  Some of them were my home boys.</p>
<p class="line" id="line938"><a name="pos938"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Were you aware of the differences or problems the SDU's had with the ANC Youth League?</p>
<p class="line" id="line939"><a name="pos939"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> No, I was not aware.  Because even if we would meet, we would not talk about problems of the SDU or ANC Youth League, we just talked about personal things.</p>
<p class="line" id="line940"><a name="pos940"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Some of the applicants told this Committee that the SDU's attempted on several occasions, to hold a meeting with the ANC Youth League, but that the League was avoiding such a meeting.  Are you aware of that or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line941"><a name="pos941"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> I have no knowledge of such, the only thing I know is that Nomfundu was told to get dressed and go to a meeting called by the ANC Youth League at Block E.</p>
<p class="line" id="line942"><a name="pos942"></a>	But because she did not go to the meeting, I never did find out why they were called to the meeting.  I am not aware about other meetings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line943"><a name="pos943"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> You said the meeting was supposed to be held at a place you call FNB, where is this place in relation to the shack where Bulelwa was staying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line944"><a name="pos944"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> It is not too far, it is quite close.</p>
<p class="line" id="line945"><a name="pos945"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> You said Thokozani Buthelezi,  that is Mr Buthelezi's son, asked for a key, what key was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line946"><a name="pos946"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> I don't know what key this was.  However, I thought that it was a key that belonged to a shack that was opposite this lady where I was, where these children would gather regularly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line947"><a name="pos947"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> From the day Bulelwa asked questions at the meeting about the formation of the new SDU, how many days thereafter was she killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line948"><a name="pos948"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> I cannot remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line949"><a name="pos949"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Were there many days, a week or less than a week?</p>
<p class="line" id="line950"><a name="pos950"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> I don't want to lie, I can't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line951"><a name="pos951"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> You said you were woken up by somebody in the morning, who asked you whether you heard some gun shots, who is this person who woke you up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line952"><a name="pos952"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> It is Zwandile.</p>
<p class="line" id="line953"><a name="pos953"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> What is the surname?</p>
<p class="line" id="line954"><a name="pos954"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> I don't know what his surname is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line955"><a name="pos955"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Did you personally hear those gun shots during that night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line956"><a name="pos956"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> Yes, I did hear the gun shots.</p>
<p class="line" id="line957"><a name="pos957"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson, no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line958"><a name="pos958"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Ms Ndwane, did I hear you correctly saying that when you got to Bulelwa's corpse, that Buthelezi was there saying to you that he did not sleep the whole of the night and he was looking over the corpse?</p>
<p class="line" id="line959"><a name="pos959"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> I did say that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line960"><a name="pos960"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And this is Thokozani Buthelezi's father?</p>
<p class="line" id="line961"><a name="pos961"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line962"><a name="pos962"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> He was guarding at the corpse the whole of the night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line963"><a name="pos963"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> That is what he said, he said they were guarding the corpse the whole night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line964"><a name="pos964"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did you see any of the SDU members there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line965"><a name="pos965"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> I don't remember seeing members of the SDU, I just saw members of the community because we had also gone to see the corpse as part of the community.  I did not really notice any member of the SDU.</p>
<p class="line" id="line966"><a name="pos966"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did I hear you further correctly when Mr Madasa led your evidence that you were saying that you were told that that meeting at Block F was called and that a new SDU was going to be formed?  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line967"><a name="pos967"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line968"><a name="pos968"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And then you were asked who called you and who told you and you said you don't know.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line969"><a name="pos969"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> I am not sure about that sir.  Are you saying that I said that I did not know who called the meeting, I said the meeting was called by the members of the Block, the one person that I noticed was Mr Buthelezi.</p>
<p class="line" id="line970"><a name="pos970"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Yes, but you were asked - let me put the question to you again, when that meeting was called and when you were told to come to the meeting, did they tell you what the meeting was about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line971"><a name="pos971"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> No, you are not supposed to be told what the meeting is about when you are being called to a meeting, you hear when you are at the meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line972"><a name="pos972"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So at that stage you had no knowledge of the new SDU to be formed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line973"><a name="pos973"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> At the time the meeting was called, I did not know that they were going to form a new SDU.</p>
<p class="line" id="line974"><a name="pos974"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line975"><a name="pos975"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, Mr Motata?</p>
<p class="line" id="line976"><a name="pos976"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTATA:</span> Thank you Chairperson.  Ms Ndwane, did Nomfundu tell you the name of the members who comprised their Executive Committee of the ANC Youth League?</p>
<p class="line" id="line977"><a name="pos977"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> No, she never told me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line978"><a name="pos978"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTATA:</span> You said when she came back from the meeting, she never carried any book whatsoever.  Do you recall saying so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line979"><a name="pos979"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> I did say so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line980"><a name="pos980"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTATA:</span> Did she describe what kind of Secretary she was in the Executive of the Youth League?</p>
<p class="line" id="line981"><a name="pos981"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> I never asked for details.</p>
<p class="line" id="line982"><a name="pos982"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTATA:</span> I am asking you this because in the bundle of documents we have here, there is one David Marema who says he was the Secretary General of the ANC Youth League during 1993.</p>
<p class="line" id="line983"><a name="pos983"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> I don't know that person.  She just told me that she was the Secretary of the ANC Youth League.  I am not sure whether I am referring to the ANC Youth League Block F, however she was the Secretary of the ANC Youth League.</p>
<p class="line" id="line984"><a name="pos984"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTATA:</span> Thank you Chairperson, I've got no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line985"><a name="pos985"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You were not a member of the SDU, were you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line986"><a name="pos986"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> No, I was not a member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line987"><a name="pos987"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You did not patrol together with the SDU, did you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line988"><a name="pos988"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> I never did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line989"><a name="pos989"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How did you know that the SDU patrolled all the Blocks?</p>
<p class="line" id="line990"><a name="pos990"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> As a member of the community, I knew that the SDU patrolled all the Blocks, but I was not patrolling with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line991"><a name="pos991"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You were not aware of any complaints against the SDU?</p>
<p class="line" id="line992"><a name="pos992"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line993"><a name="pos993"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were there no complaints against the SDU from Block F?</p>
<p class="line" id="line994"><a name="pos994"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> I never heard anyone complaining.</p>
<p class="line" id="line995"><a name="pos995"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you - and I take it that the SDU also patrolled Block F?</p>
<p class="line" id="line996"><a name="pos996"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> I did not hear well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line997"><a name="pos997"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The SDU according to you, also patrolled Block F?</p>
<p class="line" id="line998"><a name="pos998"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> I think so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line999"><a name="pos999"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You resided at Block F?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1000"><a name="pos1000"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1001"><a name="pos1001"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you see the members of the SDU patrolling Block F?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1002"><a name="pos1002"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> We would sleep at night, certain that they are patrolling the area.  I never made certain that they actually do patrol the area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1003"><a name="pos1003"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you know of any reason why some people in Block F would want to form a new SDU?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1004"><a name="pos1004"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> I think I already said that the reason I heard about was that they were forming a new SDU because they were saying that their parents were being attacked, I am not certain who exactly was attacking their parents.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1005"><a name="pos1005"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Whose parents were being attacked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1006"><a name="pos1006"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> Parents to the children who wanted to form a new SDU.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1007"><a name="pos1007"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The meeting that you attended, was it attended by the Youth at which the decision to form a new SDU was being discussed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1008"><a name="pos1008"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> I am not sure if the Youth was there, because when you talk about the ANC Youth League, it is not somebody - it is not, I cannot put a face to the ANC Youth League, I don't know the people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1009"><a name="pos1009"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you aware of any reason why the residents, the parents of Block F would want to form a new SDU?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1010"><a name="pos1010"></a><span class="speaker">MS NDWANE:</span> I have no such knowledge because I was not a part of those parents.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1011"><a name="pos1011"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.  Mr Madasa?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1085"><a name="pos1085"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOHLAKWANE:</span> The following day, that is on Sunday, whilst I was still at my house, Ndlamini together with a few boys arrived at my place, with those boxes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1086"><a name="pos1086"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> They came with those boxes?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1090"><a name="pos1090"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1091"><a name="pos1091"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOHLAKWANE:</span> There was a big truck.  When she alighted from the taxi, a group of boys came from that truck and attacked my wife.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1092"><a name="pos1092"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Who are those boys?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1093"><a name="pos1093"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOHLAKWANE:</span> That is members of the ANC Youth League.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1095"><a name="pos1095"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOHLAKWANE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1096"><a name="pos1096"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> You did?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1097"><a name="pos1097"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOHLAKWANE:</span> I was looking, yes, I did.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1100"><a name="pos1100"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> I can't hear you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1101"><a name="pos1101"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOHLAKWANE:</span> Whilst they were attacking Radebe said to me, that people are attacking your wife.  Then I went there to intervene and say it is better for me to die.  When they saw me, they left my wife and came to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1102"><a name="pos1102"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Were they armed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1103"><a name="pos1103"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOHLAKWANE:</span> Yes, they were armed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1104"><a name="pos1104"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> With what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1105"><a name="pos1105"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOHLAKWANE:</span> With a short gun and a rifle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1106"><a name="pos1106"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> And what else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1107"><a name="pos1107"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOHLAKWANE:</span> And some sticks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1108"><a name="pos1108"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> How many were they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1109"><a name="pos1109"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOHLAKWANE:</span> It was a group, I was not able to count them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1110"><a name="pos1110"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Did they assault your wife?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1111"><a name="pos1111"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think he said yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1112"><a name="pos1112"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> With what?  With what did they assault your wife?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1113"><a name="pos1113"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOHLAKWANE:</span> They assaulted my wife with stones, with all those things and they were kicking her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1114"><a name="pos1114"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> How did they assault her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1115"><a name="pos1115"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOHLAKWANE:</span> From Radebe's place, the three of us we were taken the three of us, we were taken to a veld.  They were saying they were going to kill us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1116"><a name="pos1116"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Who was taken to the veld, were you together with your wife?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1117"><a name="pos1117"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOHLAKWANE:</span> They left my wife when I appeared, they took myself together with the other two whom I was relaxing with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1118"><a name="pos1118"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> It was you and Radebe, who was the other person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1119"><a name="pos1119"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOHLAKWANE:</span> Radebe was the owner of the house, the other one was his brother-in-law, then the other one was his neighbour.  So they left Radebe and they took us, the three of us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1120"><a name="pos1120"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> What did they do to you when they reached the veld?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1121"><a name="pos1121"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOHLAKWANE:</span> We were taken next to the river bank where Ndlamini tied my hands at the back.  When they completed, they set fire and they sent boys to go and buy petrol.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1122"><a name="pos1122"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Were you tied?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1123"><a name="pos1123"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOHLAKWANE:</span> Yes, I was tied.  Then the community came, members of the community came.  They helped us because they called these boys aside, then those men accompanied me home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1124"><a name="pos1124"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> You were saved?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1125"><a name="pos1125"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOHLAKWANE:</span> Yes, I was saved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1126"><a name="pos1126"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Do you know the reason for the attack, do you know why you were attacked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1127"><a name="pos1127"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOHLAKWANE:</span> Whilst I was walking, whilst I was being beaten, saying that I am informer Mowenpe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1128"><a name="pos1128"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> You were accused of being an informer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1129"><a name="pos1129"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOHLAKWANE:</span> People who are called Mowenpe were Inkatha members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1130"><a name="pos1130"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Were you accused of being an informer, therefore an Inkatha member?  Were you accused of being a Mowenpe and therefore an Inkatha member?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1131"><a name="pos1131"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOHLAKWANE:</span> That is correct sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1132"><a name="pos1132"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Did anything further happen to you, after you were saved by the community?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1133"><a name="pos1133"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOHLAKWANE:</span> No sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1134"><a name="pos1134"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Is there any other incident that the ANC Youth League caused which you witnessed?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1139"><a name="pos1139"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOHLAKWANE:</span> Yes.  I saw the corpses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1140"><a name="pos1140"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Of whom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1141"><a name="pos1141"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOHLAKWANE:</span> Majosi and his two cousins.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1142"><a name="pos1142"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Do you know who killed them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1143"><a name="pos1143"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOHLAKWANE:</span> I learnt that it was members of the Youth.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1145"><a name="pos1145"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOHLAKWANE:</span> It was his sister.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1146"><a name="pos1146"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Is there any other incident that you know of besides Majosi and yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1147"><a name="pos1147"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Which would also be hearsay.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1166"><a name="pos1166"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Mr Chairman, that is the applicant's case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1167"><a name="pos1167"></a>APPLICANT'S CASE</p>
<p class="line" id="line1168"><a name="pos1168"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mapoma, do you intend leading evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1169"><a name="pos1169"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Yes, Chairperson, I intend leading evidence from the side of the victims.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1170"><a name="pos1170"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Very well, we will listen to that evidence at two o'clock.  We will now take the lunch adjournment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1171"><a name="pos1171"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line1172"><a name="pos1172"></a>ON RESUMPTION</p>
<p class="line" id="line1173"><a name="pos1173"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, Mr Mapoma?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1174"><a name="pos1174"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Thank you sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1175"><a name="pos1175"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Would you perhaps outline to us, is the basis or what is the basis of the opposition?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1176"><a name="pos1176"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Chairperson, the families oppose the amnesty because they say that the truth has not come out, in fact they contest most of the allegations which have been set out from the applicants' case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1177"><a name="pos1177"></a>	They want in a way to give their perspective of the actual events they say took place, and now in that regard, Chairperson, there are some witnesses who are members of the ANC Youth League.  One of those witnesses whom I am going to call now, Chairperson, is Tusaneng Lekabe, who has been referred to by the applicants on a number of occasions as to what happened on that day, and so he will show what actually happened and where the differences are between the versions of the applicants and the versions of the victims.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1178"><a name="pos1178"></a>	Then we have those who were captured, but released.  Some of them feel that the way they were captured, has not been set out the way it actually happened and the injuries they suffered and the treatment they were subjected to, has not been given here.  The family members in particular the mothers, of the deceased, want to show what happened on that day and their role before their children happened to be killed, and they want to show that, in fact they say that they are particularly concerned that an impression is given that they did not respond when there children were caught, whereas they did respond, but they were chased away by the applicants.  It is along those lines, Chairperson, that this evidence is going to go.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1179"><a name="pos1179"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is it on the issue from the victims point of view, one of lack of full disclosure?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1180"><a name="pos1180"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Yes Chairperson, it is lack of full disclosure, but some of the witnesses from the side of the ANC Youth League, claim that what has been done, was not politically motivated.  They have got a feeling that it was a pure criminal act.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1181"><a name="pos1181"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is the basis of the opposition therefore that one, there hasn't been a full disclosure, and secondly there was no political motive behind the killing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1182"><a name="pos1182"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Absolutely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1183"><a name="pos1183"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, very well, would you call the first witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1184"><a name="pos1184"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> May I call Tusaneng Lekabe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1185"><a name="pos1185"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How many witnesses do you propose calling Mr Mapoma?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1186"><a name="pos1186"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> I propose calling three witnesses Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1187"><a name="pos1187"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are these three witnesses going to deal with the issue of full disclosure?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1188"><a name="pos1188"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1189"><a name="pos1189"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And what else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1190"><a name="pos1190"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> And political motivation, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1191"><a name="pos1191"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, very well.  To the extent that it may be necessary, I think it is clear from what Mr Mapoma has said, that we will have to sit beyond today.  I would like to inform the interpreters and the recording people that we will be here on Monday and we will run from Monday until we are finished.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1192"><a name="pos1192"></a>	Mr Lekabe, what language are you going to speak?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1193"><a name="pos1193"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> I am going to speak Sotho sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1194"><a name="pos1194"></a><span class="speaker">LETUSANG RAYMOND SHARON LEKABE:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1195"><a name="pos1195"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR MAPOMA:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Lekabe, during December 1993, where did you reside?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1196"><a name="pos1196"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> I stayed in Muleleki Extension 2.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1197"><a name="pos1197"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Were you a member of any local structure of the community there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1198"><a name="pos1198"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> That is correct My Lord.  I was the Secretary General of our area, which is Muleleki Extension 2.  We were under the umbrella of SANCO, and I was the Secretary, Information Secretary within the Youth League.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1199"><a name="pos1199"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> So you were the Secretary General of the Civic Organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1200"><a name="pos1200"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> That is correct My Lord.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1201"><a name="pos1201"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> And the Secretary of the ANC Youth League?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1202"><a name="pos1202"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1203"><a name="pos1203"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Did you know, do you know Bulelwa who died on the 6th of December 1993?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1204"><a name="pos1204"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> Yes, I know her.  She was a member of the Civic.  She was a member of the Block Committee.   Yes, I knew her.  Because she was one member of the Civic in Block F.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1205"><a name="pos1205"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Now, between the ANC Youth League and SANCO was there any working relationship?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1206"><a name="pos1206"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> There was sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1207"><a name="pos1207"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Can you describe briefly what kind of working relationship did you have?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1208"><a name="pos1208"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> At times we patrolled together, until there was a separation, then we were told that the SDU will be operating at night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1209"><a name="pos1209"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Sorry, I am asking the working relationship between the ANC Youth League and the Civic?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1210"><a name="pos1210"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> That is correct.  The Civic is a much bigger structure, taking care of all the community.  Every problem that arose, was reported to the Civic.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1211"><a name="pos1211"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were there any members of the ANC Youth League, who formed part of the Civic?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1212"><a name="pos1212"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> No sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1213"><a name="pos1213"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> You said you were a member of the ANC Youth League, and also a member of the Civic, haven't you, you said so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1214"><a name="pos1214"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> That is what I said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1215"><a name="pos1215"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Now, can you just describe the working relationship that was there between the ANC Youth League and the Civic Organisation in Muleleki Extension?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1216"><a name="pos1216"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> I already said that all organisations within the township, reported to the Civic.  There was a working relationship, we did not take sides.  Everybody was accepted by the Civic.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1217"><a name="pos1217"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> So are you saying the ANC Youth League was also reporting to the Civic, is that what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1218"><a name="pos1218"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> That is correct My Lord.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1219"><a name="pos1219"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Now about Bulelwa in particular, was she having a working relationship with the ANC Youth League?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1220"><a name="pos1220"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> I would say yes because she was regarded as a leader.  She used to sit down with them and give them MRice, they liked her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1221"><a name="pos1221"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Do you recall the incident of the 6th of December 1993?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1222"><a name="pos1222"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> That is correct sir.  On the 6th of December 1993, round about five past, if not ten past eight at night, the deceased Buthelezi came home crying, and he was shouting, he was saying oh, please, please and I tried to calm him down.  I said Mr Buthelezi, calm down, speak so that we can understand what happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1223"><a name="pos1223"></a>	He said no, comrade Bulelwa has passed away and I said how should I be of assistance.  And he said Mr Mokoena said I must come and fetch you.  There was another man, an inhabitant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1224"><a name="pos1224"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> So you say that Mr Buthelezi reported that Bulelwa has been killed?  Then what did you do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1225"><a name="pos1225"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> Mr Buthelezi was crying when he approached me.  He said oh, no, Bulelwa has died.  I said please calm down, you are crying, I can't hear what you are saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1226"><a name="pos1226"></a>	He said Bulelwa is dead, and I am here, sent by Mr Mokoena to come and fetch you because at that time, there was another man, an ordinary inhabitant of the township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1227"><a name="pos1227"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> The Mr Buthelezi that you are talking about, is that Mr Buthelezi who was killed amongst the other youth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1228"><a name="pos1228"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> That is the same person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1229"><a name="pos1229"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Okay, continue then.  Yes, I was together with another man who came to tell me something privately, and Mr Buthelezi said Mr Mokoena want me, and I wanted to go but that man who was a citizen of the township, said stop.  You know very well, you are not in very good terms with these SDU men, now it will be easy for them to catch up with you and kill you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1230"><a name="pos1230"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Were you not in good terms with the SDU's?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1231"><a name="pos1231"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> That is correct, we were not in good terms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1232"><a name="pos1232"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> What problems did you have with the SDU's?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1233"><a name="pos1233"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> My Lord, I can mention many problems.  Even the community can support me on that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1234"><a name="pos1234"></a>	The first problem is related to when the community was saying we have an SDU, it is patrolling, but people keep on dying.  At night when we come from work, we are harassed and assaulted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1235"><a name="pos1235"></a>	When I was asked, they said where are you from.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1236"><a name="pos1236"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> No, before then.   Let's go to this SDU, don't be fast please so as to allow the interpreters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1237"><a name="pos1237"></a>	Now, when was the SDU formed in Muleleki?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1238"><a name="pos1238"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> According to my knowledge the SDU in Muleleki was formed in May if not June.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1239"><a name="pos1239"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> When it was formed, was the community involved?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1240"><a name="pos1240"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> May or June of which year?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1241"><a name="pos1241"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> 1993.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1242"><a name="pos1242"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Can you describe briefly how was it formed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1243"><a name="pos1243"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> At the time Muleleki was still under construction.  They were still busy with the building of toilets, and people gradually occupied their sites.  If I remember well, people who resided in Block E and D were the first to form the SDU.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1244"><a name="pos1244"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Was the community involved in the formation of the SDU's?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1245"><a name="pos1245"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> No, My Lord.  The community did not have an opportunity in taking part.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1246"><a name="pos1246"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Now, what problems were there with the SDU's?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1247"><a name="pos1247"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> I said there were many problems, because as the leaders of the community, all structures were supposed to report to us as the leaders of the community, but now they did not want to subscribe to us.  They said we must subscribe under them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1248"><a name="pos1248"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> When you say us, what do you mean?  As a Civic or as the ANC Youth League?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1249"><a name="pos1249"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> Yes, the Civic.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1250"><a name="pos1250"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Now, as the Civic, did you call a community meeting to address the problems that you had with them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1251"><a name="pos1251"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> Yes, a meeting was called to discuss this issue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1252"><a name="pos1252"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Are there any other problems which were highlighted in that meeting about the activities of the SDU's?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1253"><a name="pos1253"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> Yes, sir.  We explained to the community that the members of the SDU are giving us problems, the way the operate.  When we called them to come and appear before you, they don't want to, now we don't know what steps to follow.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1254"><a name="pos1254"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> The way they operate, what do you mean, what way did they operate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1255"><a name="pos1255"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> I told you already that there were many problems, for instance when they patrolled at night, when they pass in the street and they see that your lights are still on, they get into your house, assault you, ask you why don't you go to bed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1256"><a name="pos1256"></a>	Some of the women were being raped, people were killed.  When they patrolled sir, when they found you outside, they would assault you.  When they pass by the road, because that place did not have street lights as yet, now when there was light in your house, they would get into your house, and ask you why don't you go to bed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1257"><a name="pos1257"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Now, let's come to this SDU.  Have you seen all the applicants?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1258"><a name="pos1258"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> Yes, I saw them but ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1259"><a name="pos1259"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Were the applicants part of the SDU you are talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1260"><a name="pos1260"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1261"><a name="pos1261"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Now, when these problems were highlighted in a meeting, was the SDU present in that meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1262"><a name="pos1262"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> They were present My Lord, because the person who was always there is Tsepo and Nxeba.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1263"><a name="pos1263"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> When these accusations were given against them, what was their response?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1264"><a name="pos1264"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> When these accusations were taken out, they were not happy at all.  They then said SANCO wants to rule them and yet, they were independent.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1265"><a name="pos1265"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is SANCO and Civic one and the same thing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1266"><a name="pos1266"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1267"><a name="pos1267"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Now was ANC Youth League part of the meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1268"><a name="pos1268"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> Yes, every organisation reported to the Civic.  They were members of the township, so they were present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1269"><a name="pos1269"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now when these problems were highlighted, are there any members of the ANC Youth League who were saying something also about the SDU's?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1270"><a name="pos1270"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> Every member of the community has the right to speak at the meeting, called by the Civic.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1271"><a name="pos1271"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did members of the ANC Youth League speak at this meeting and say anything about the SDU's?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1272"><a name="pos1272"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> They spoke but they did not say anything bad.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1273"><a name="pos1273"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Thank you Chairperson.  Now was there a specific response from the SDU to the ANC Youth League?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1274"><a name="pos1274"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> Yes, there is something that the SDU said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1275"><a name="pos1275"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> What is it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1276"><a name="pos1276"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> Chairperson, I have already told you that we had problems.  They said it was better as members of the committee, Sectional Committee, shouldn't we fight with you because you don't want to understand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1277"><a name="pos1277"></a>	They wanted to go straight to the community, they were supposed to come to the Civic to report because everybody had to start first at the Civics.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1278"><a name="pos1278"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> My question is, is there anything that the SDU members said about the ANC Youth League or is there any specific response that was directed to the ANC Youth League from the SDU in that meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1279"><a name="pos1279"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> Yes, sir there is something they said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1280"><a name="pos1280"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> What is it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1281"><a name="pos1281"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> They said you members of the ANC Youth League, you must better keep quiet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1282"><a name="pos1282"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Okay.  Now, let's come back to the incident of the killing of Bulelwa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1283"><a name="pos1283"></a>	You were saying Mr Buthelezi told you that Bulelwa has been killed, and was crying and he called you.  What did you do thereafter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1284"><a name="pos1284"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> I did not go, but at that time because the community heard Mr Buthelezi's cry, they came together and they said, guys you are aware that the SDU is now attacking and our leaders are now dying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1285"><a name="pos1285"></a>	And it was rumoured that during that December time they were going to attack leaders of the community.  Now we had to stand together to protect the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1286"><a name="pos1286"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Then what did you do as the community then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1287"><a name="pos1287"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> As the community, we left, we searched for members of the SDU, we did not find some of them until we arrived at Blanko.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1288"><a name="pos1288"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Now, when you say as the community, do you mean members of the ANC Youth League were involved also and other people of the community other than ANC Youth League?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1289"><a name="pos1289"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> The members of the community and members of the ANC Youth League.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1290"><a name="pos1290"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now, you arrived at Blanko's place, what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1291"><a name="pos1291"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> When we arrived there, he was sleeping because he opened the door and he said, what is happening.  Now the answer we gave him was, you guys caused trouble and thereafter you go to bed.  We want you to tell us where some of your members are, because even the guns that you use against the community, were bought by the same community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1292"><a name="pos1292"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Was Blanko attacked by the community?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1293"><a name="pos1293"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> That is correct My Lord.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1294"><a name="pos1294"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What about the ANC Youth League?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1295"><a name="pos1295"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> I said they were part of the community, so they attacked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1296"><a name="pos1296"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Now after the attack, where did you go?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1297"><a name="pos1297"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> We went to the long grass and we laid there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1298"><a name="pos1298"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Yes, and after that what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1299"><a name="pos1299"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> After quite some time, one of us said guys, the members of the SDU are coming.  Then we took different directions, trying to run for cover because they were already shooting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1300"><a name="pos1300"></a>	We took different directions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1301"><a name="pos1301"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Were you armed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1302"><a name="pos1302"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> Yes, we were armed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1303"><a name="pos1303"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Did you hit back?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1304"><a name="pos1304"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> We did not hit back.  They were unexpected sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1305"><a name="pos1305"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Then describe what happened when they arrived.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1306"><a name="pos1306"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> There were many of us, even members of the community.  Now, at a place where we thought we were hidden, we were there for a few minutes.  I think just after five minutes, gun shots were heard and we said they are very close, let's run away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1307"><a name="pos1307"></a>	We then ran to Block A.  There is a house where we got into.  I think we were six if not seven in number.  We stayed there.  The first two went out to check outside for, they were quiet, they didn't come back and myself and the deceased Ali Zulu went out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1308"><a name="pos1308"></a>	We saw members of the SDU coming, they were armed and...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1309"><a name="pos1309"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Now just there, can you describe who exactly did you see?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1310"><a name="pos1310"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> Who are you referring to sir, members of the SDU?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1311"><a name="pos1311"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Yes, can you tell who were they, these members of the SDU?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1312"><a name="pos1312"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> Yes, I have them.  Nxeba was among them, Oscar was there, Rooivalk was also there, some of them I do not remember because the one mentioned earlier on as Wehna was also there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1313"><a name="pos1313"></a>	I said to the deceased don't run away, and I grabbed him by his hand, but fear overcame him and he ran away.  He tried to jump over the fence behind where we were sleeping, but he could not jump, and then he fell.  Because they were on his tail, Nxeba himself had a spear and he stabbed him on the cheek with that spear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1314"><a name="pos1314"></a>	Now he was crying, blood was spitting, Nxeba lifted him up.  Among the members of the SDU who were approaching was Nxeba and then on the 5th, we had an altercation with Nxeba because of a site they wanted to give to someone, and he said I knew that I will catch up with you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1315"><a name="pos1315"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Will you please speak very slowly so that the interpreters may have time to interpret what you are saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1316"><a name="pos1316"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> Thank you sir.  I said when we went out, we saw the members of the SDU and I grabbed the deceased by his hand and I said please, don't try to run away, I know them, they cannot speak with people, all they do is just fight.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1317"><a name="pos1317"></a>	But because fear overcame him, he ran away and he wanted to jump over the fence, he couldn't, he fell.  Nxeba arrived and he stabbed him on the cheek with a spear, then blood came out and then he lifted him and he came back with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1318"><a name="pos1318"></a>	There was another group of men coming.  I already told you that on Sunday the 5th, I had an altercation with Wehna and he said I knew that I will catch you, because I told you that this week will not even pass.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1319"><a name="pos1319"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now, what became of Ali?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1320"><a name="pos1320"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> I was talking with Oscar and next to him, the others tried to shoot at me.  The one who had 765, tried to shoot me three times, but the magazine went out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1321"><a name="pos1321"></a>	Rooivalk tried to shoot me with an AK47, it stuck.  Oscar himself shot at the deceased on the chest with six bullets, and then he spit on the floor.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1322"><a name="pos1322"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Was there any shootout between you and the SDU's then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1323"><a name="pos1323"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> No sir.  There was no shooting out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1324"><a name="pos1324"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Now after Ali was shot at, what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1325"><a name="pos1325"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> When Nxeba realised that I was not shot at, one could see that he was sweating.  He said guys, you must know that he is their leader, if you kill him, the community is going to ask why did he not come to account.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1326"><a name="pos1326"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What happened, what did they do with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1327"><a name="pos1327"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> My Lord, we walked through the township and just before Block D, I think we passed about three shacks, they knocked at a certain shack.  They were already kicking and one boy came out of the shack, I think he was naked, he didn't have clothes on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1328"><a name="pos1328"></a>	Nxeba stabbed him then they put him back, so that he can put on his clothes.  Then the other one came out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1329"><a name="pos1329"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Do you know who the boy was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1330"><a name="pos1330"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> Because of the commotion I cannot, but I do not know him, but I can identify him if he appears today.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1331"><a name="pos1331"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> At what part of the body was he stabbed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1332"><a name="pos1332"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> He was naked, Nxeba stabbed him on the hands and on the ribs, he tried to block with his hands.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1333"><a name="pos1333"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Then what happened?  What became of the boy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1334"><a name="pos1334"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> I said there was an Albino boy inside the house, when he came out of the house, they said no, he cannot see at night, go back, we don't know what you want here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1335"><a name="pos1335"></a>	Then we walked along that street and they went into another house to fetch another boy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1336"><a name="pos1336"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Now, when you  went along, was this boy who was stabbed, taken along?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1337"><a name="pos1337"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> That is correct, My Lord.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1338"><a name="pos1338"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Okay, he went along then, where to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1339"><a name="pos1339"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> They tried to round us up.  They managed to catch up with another one, they came with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1340"><a name="pos1340"></a>	Because some of them are guarding you and then some get into the shacks, looking for other boys.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1341"><a name="pos1341"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Now, you went along?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1342"><a name="pos1342"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> I remember one boy was taken out of the house and he was already crying.  Oscar spoke to him and then he asked me whether I know him, and I said no.  You can ask him, verify it with him, he does not know me at all.  It is my first time to see him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1343"><a name="pos1343"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Why did Oscar ask if the boy knows you, do you know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1344"><a name="pos1344"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> I think that boy was already crying when he came out, he said he arrived the previous night from Kumalo, he knew nothing of what was happening and Oscar left him and then he said he must leave.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1345"><a name="pos1345"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTATA:</span> So you went along, where to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1346"><a name="pos1346"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> We went to Block F, where Bulelwa's corpse was.  I think there were already three if not two young boys who were captured.  Nxeba, but I do not remember whether it was him, but he is present here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1347"><a name="pos1347"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you proceeded to Block F, how many of you had been captured by Nxeba and oscer's group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1348"><a name="pos1348"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> We were three or four, I can't remember well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1349"><a name="pos1349"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can you still recall who were with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1350"><a name="pos1350"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> Yes, I still remember one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1351"><a name="pos1351"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who are they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1352"><a name="pos1352"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> Well, I do not know his name, but he is present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1353"><a name="pos1353"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where is he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1354"><a name="pos1354"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> He is among the audience.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1355"><a name="pos1355"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTATA:</span> Could you point him out, let him rise or stand up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1356"><a name="pos1356"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> The white T-shirt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1357"><a name="pos1357"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is your name sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1358"><a name="pos1358"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> His name is Jacob, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1359"><a name="pos1359"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Jacob Moloi, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1360"><a name="pos1360"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> I do not remember the other one, but he is also present here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1361"><a name="pos1361"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where is he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1362"><a name="pos1362"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> I am trying to look for him.  There.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1363"><a name="pos1363"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is your name sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1364"><a name="pos1364"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> Motibang Mokoena is my name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1365"><a name="pos1365"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1366"><a name="pos1366"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> I do not remember the other one.  We were three or four, I do not remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1367"><a name="pos1367"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You don't remember the names of the other person, or you don't remember whether they were present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1368"><a name="pos1368"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> I do not know the name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1369"><a name="pos1369"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The name of the third person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1370"><a name="pos1370"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> Yes sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1371"><a name="pos1371"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> On your arrival at Block F, what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1372"><a name="pos1372"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> As I said, when we arrived at Block F, they said to me, I should go to the shack.  I went to the shack again and I went back again to them to the SDU's, and they were together with the members of the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1373"><a name="pos1373"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Now, you said when you went into the shack, there were already some who were inside the shack, how many were there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1374"><a name="pos1374"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> There were three sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1375"><a name="pos1375"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> There were seven of you at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1376"><a name="pos1376"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> Yes, we were seven.  Those I came with, they proceeded to the shack, then I remained behind.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1377"><a name="pos1377"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Can you tell who those who were already in the shack, were, their names?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1378"><a name="pos1378"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> Those who were already in the shack, some of them have since died.  I don't know the names. They knew me as the leader of the community, but I didn't know some of their names.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1379"><a name="pos1379"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Now you were allowed to leave the shack and to go to some people around Bulelwa's body, then what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1380"><a name="pos1380"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you allowed to go there, or were you instructed to go where Bulelwa's body was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1381"><a name="pos1381"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> They did not instruct me, I myself went there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1382"><a name="pos1382"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Were you free to move around?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1383"><a name="pos1383"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> Yes, I was free because whilst we were still at Bulelwa's corpse, among the community there was one who said what time was it, but at that time it was already sunrise.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1384"><a name="pos1384"></a>	Then somebody said if the Police come, we are going to fight with them because it has already been eight hours since she has died.  From those members of the SDU, that is Vusi, Nxeba and Oscar and Alex, I don't remember the fifth one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1385"><a name="pos1385"></a>	That is where Oscar, when I returned to the shack, he tried to shoot me, and Mr Mokoena prevented him to do so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1386"><a name="pos1386"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Then what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1387"><a name="pos1387"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> From where the members of the SDU find you up to the spot where Bulelwa's body was, were you just walking freely?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1388"><a name="pos1388"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> That is correct sir, I was walking freely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1389"><a name="pos1389"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Could you have gone home if you wanted to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1390"><a name="pos1390"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> I wouldn't try to go home, because the way they were armed, they would kill me.  But I just said to myself, let me just go like some of those who were captured.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1391"><a name="pos1391"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did they order you to go with them to the spot where Bulelwa's body had been found?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1392"><a name="pos1392"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> That is correct sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1393"><a name="pos1393"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you were not walking freely then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1394"><a name="pos1394"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> It was like that that I was not walking freely, but that is where Nxeba said he was holding me with his hand.  I was walking freely like any other person who was walking with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1395"><a name="pos1395"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you being held by Nxeba?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1396"><a name="pos1396"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> No sir, he didn't hold me with his hand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1397"><a name="pos1397"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Then what did you do, what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1398"><a name="pos1398"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You were at the stage when you were telling us that once at the shack, Oscar tried to shoot at you.  Did he succeed in shooting you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1399"><a name="pos1399"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> No sir, he did not succeed because Mr Mokoena prevented him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1400"><a name="pos1400"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What did Oscar do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1401"><a name="pos1401"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> He had an AK47, he pulled that AK47 to, as if he was shooting me, then Mr Mokoena pushed him aside and prevented him.  Then Oscar turned to me and said Whena and Tusang are your friends.  If you say I myself have killed Bulelwa, I am going to shoot all of you and go to prison.  That is Oscar.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1402"><a name="pos1402"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Just repeat what he said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1403"><a name="pos1403"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> Whena and Tusang, you Tusaneng and your friends, I am going to shoot all of you and go to prison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1404"><a name="pos1404"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Was that because you were alleging that he had shot Bulelwa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1405"><a name="pos1405"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> No, I heard that for the first time from him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1406"><a name="pos1406"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did he give as a reason for shooting you, the fact that you had said that he had shot Bulelwa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1407"><a name="pos1407"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> That is correct.  As I said that among the community there was one who mentioned time, although I don't remember what time he said it was.  Then he said when the Police arrive, we are going to fight them because the deceased has been killed for a long time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1408"><a name="pos1408"></a>	I have already mentioned those who were in front of me, as to whether are you not going to call the Police, because as a leader of the community, I would say that as we are here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1409"><a name="pos1409"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Would you tell the Committee, from the time when Oscar said he was going to shoot you until when you left the place, what happened, how did you happen to leave the place?  You told us that Oscar tried to shoot you, but Mokoena intervened, then Oscar said to you he was going to shoot all of you, because you are saying that he had killed Bulelwa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1410"><a name="pos1410"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> If we say, if we allege that he killed Bulelwa, he will shoot at us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1411"><a name="pos1411"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, now what happened thereafter, after he had said that, what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1412"><a name="pos1412"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> I already said that among the members of the community, one person mentioned time and it came to my mind that when the Police arrive here, we are going to be at loggerheads with them about the long time that the deceased spent there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1413"><a name="pos1413"></a>	I already told you the members of the SDU that were around me, now when they responded, let me start with Oscar, he said you know that I came back from prison on Thursday.  Now the Police might take me in again.  Nxeba responded by saying you know that the Internal Stability is looking for me.  Vusi also added, he said guys, you know that all members of the Internal Stability Unit have my name, Alex withdrew, he did not respond.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1414"><a name="pos1414"></a>	I said to them guys, if there is any one among the members of the community who has transport, please provided us with transport so that we can go and fetch the Police because we wanted to go to the hospital, that is how I escaped.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1415"><a name="pos1415"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Thank you Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1416"><a name="pos1416"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1417"><a name="pos1417"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Yes, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1418"><a name="pos1418"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.  Is there any cross-examination Mr Madasa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1419"><a name="pos1419"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1420"><a name="pos1420"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1421"><a name="pos1421"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MADASA:</span> Who did you discuss with the question of getting transport?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1422"><a name="pos1422"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> I discussed this with members of the SDU and members of the community were present, listening at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1423"><a name="pos1423"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The members of the SDU that you discussed that matter with, would that include Oscar?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1424"><a name="pos1424"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1425"><a name="pos1425"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes, who else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1426"><a name="pos1426"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> Vusi Mthembu, Mike Sonti, Alex.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1427"><a name="pos1427"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Who is Alex?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1428"><a name="pos1428"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> He is not present here among the applicants.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1429"><a name="pos1429"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What did they say to this idea of you going to get a car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1430"><a name="pos1430"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> They withdrew because I indicated earlier on that we wanted to go and get the Police.  Oscar said no, and he had just been released on Thursday.  Vusi confessed that guys you know my name is among the members of the Stability Unit.  Nxeba said the same.  Alex did not respond, he just stood back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1431"><a name="pos1431"></a>	The fifth one, who was next to me, I cannot remember him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1432"><a name="pos1432"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did they allow you to go and look for the motor vehicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1433"><a name="pos1433"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> That is correct My Lord.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1434"><a name="pos1434"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Didn't they try to prevent you in any manner whatsoever?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1435"><a name="pos1435"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> One member from the community volunteered that he will provide us with a car to accompany us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1436"><a name="pos1436"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did that member say that in the presence of Oscar, Vusi, Mike and Alex?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1437"><a name="pos1437"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1438"><a name="pos1438"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So did you then go along with this member of the community to go and get the car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1439"><a name="pos1439"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> Yes, Chairperson, we were three because I do not know the third one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1440"><a name="pos1440"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It was yourself, the owner of the motor vehicle and the third person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1441"><a name="pos1441"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1442"><a name="pos1442"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You don't know the name of the owner of the motor vehicle, do you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1443"><a name="pos1443"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> I do not remember him, because we did not introduce each other.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1444"><a name="pos1444"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was there any argument as to whether or not you should be put into a shack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1445"><a name="pos1445"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> That is correct, there was such an argument.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1446"><a name="pos1446"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who said you should not be put into a shack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1447"><a name="pos1447"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> It is Sonti.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1448"><a name="pos1448"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What was the reason MRanced for not putting you in a shack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1449"><a name="pos1449"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> That I should go and account before the community, as to what exactly happened, because I was the community leader.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1450"><a name="pos1450"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Did you make a statement to the Police about this matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1451"><a name="pos1451"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> Yes, I arrived at JOCC and I only reported that there was a corpse at Muleleki Extension 2.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1452"><a name="pos1452"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> My question is have you made a statement to the Police about this matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1453"><a name="pos1453"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> About which matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1454"><a name="pos1454"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> The one you spoke about, about the killings, about you being captured by the SDU?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1455"><a name="pos1455"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> I did not give them the statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1456"><a name="pos1456"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Were you approached by the Police to make a statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1457"><a name="pos1457"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> No, they did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1458"><a name="pos1458"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> When did you arrive at Muleleki?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1459"><a name="pos1459"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> I arrived in Muleleki on the 1st of February 1993.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1460"><a name="pos1460"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> When you arrived, how many Blocks were there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1461"><a name="pos1461"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> It was only three Blocks, the fourth one was not yet fully occupied.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1462"><a name="pos1462"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Can you name those Blocks, which were originally ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1463"><a name="pos1463"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> Block A, B and C.  I mentioned already that D was not yet fully occupied.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1464"><a name="pos1464"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Now, when you arrived there, was the SDU already in existence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1465"><a name="pos1465"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> Yes, it existed already.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1466"><a name="pos1466"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> In your main statement, evidence in chief, you said the SDU was formed in May or June 1993, now you say in February it was already in existence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1467"><a name="pos1467"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> The SDU was formed in May, the one that existed that time was the one formed by the Youth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1468"><a name="pos1468"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTATA:</span> So the SDU that existed when you arrived at Muleleki when there were three Blocks, A, B and C and D not fully occupied, was the one that was formed by the Youth, are we understanding you to say that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1469"><a name="pos1469"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1470"><a name="pos1470"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTATA:</span> Was there another SDU formed, that is now the one that was formed in May.  Who formed that one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1471"><a name="pos1471"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> I do not have a full knowledge, but (indistinct) is the first person I knew.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1472"><a name="pos1472"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Do you know how it was formed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1473"><a name="pos1473"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> I do not know how it was formed, I only heard that there was a newly formed SDU.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1474"><a name="pos1474"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> The applicants say the SDU was formed in 1992, what do you say about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1475"><a name="pos1475"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> It is a lie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1476"><a name="pos1476"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> When the SDU was formed in May, June 1993, was a meeting called?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1477"><a name="pos1477"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> No, we only knew that there was an SDU, we saw them patrolling.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1478"><a name="pos1478"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> And you later joined them and became one organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1479"><a name="pos1479"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> Yes, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1480"><a name="pos1480"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Why did you join the new formation instead of joining Youth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1481"><a name="pos1481"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> It is because the old one was only members of the Youth, we wanted to join them because they were elderly people, we wanted them to show us the way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1482"><a name="pos1482"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> You wanted them to teach you discipline?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1483"><a name="pos1483"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> We wanted them to show us the way, maybe as the Youth we were not walking the right way.  We wanted them to teach us exactly how the SDU operates.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1484"><a name="pos1484"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> You wanted them to teach you discipline when patrolling?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1485"><a name="pos1485"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1486"><a name="pos1486"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Because you were not disciplined?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1487"><a name="pos1487"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> Not that we lacked discipline, we did not have the knowledge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1488"><a name="pos1488"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> You have admitted that you wanted them to teach you discipline.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1489"><a name="pos1489"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> Discipline and knowledge, yes.  Because we believed as the Youth we would be telling ourselves that we were doing the right thing, and would have been mistaken.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1490"><a name="pos1490"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> So you had knowledge, but no discipline?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1491"><a name="pos1491"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Madasa, does it follow necessarily that because they wanted discipline, therefore they were not disciplined?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1492"><a name="pos1492"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Mr Chairman, the witness has said ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1493"><a name="pos1493"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Does it really follow necessarily?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1494"><a name="pos1494"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> The witness has said they wanted the SDU because they were old, to teach them discipline because all that they had was knowledge, so I am asking now ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1495"><a name="pos1495"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, he said, the witness said we wanted to join them because they were adults.  The essence of what he is saying is we wanted to learn from them, how to do things.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1496"><a name="pos1496"></a>	What is being put to you is that you did not have discipline so that is why you wanted to be taught discipline?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1497"><a name="pos1497"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> That is not correct, it doesn't mean that we did not have discipline.  We wanted a broad knowledge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1498"><a name="pos1498"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Mr Chairman, the witness has said, I asked him specifically and his answer is that they wanted SDU to teach them discipline.  I used the discipline and he used the word discipline, now I am pursuing that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1499"><a name="pos1499"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Madasa, the witness has just answered you and he said they had - he disputes the fact that they did not have discipline.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1500"><a name="pos1500"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Are you contradicting yourself, because earlier on you said that you wanted to be taught discipline, now you say you had discipline?  Are you contradicting yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1501"><a name="pos1501"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The witness is not contradicting himself here.  The witness simply said we wanted knowledge and discipline and he denies that they did not have discipline, and he disputes that fact.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1502"><a name="pos1502"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Mr Chairman, the witness said they wanted knowledge and discipline.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1503"><a name="pos1503"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Madasa, the witness, if you want to take the matter up, we can take the matter up in argument.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1504"><a name="pos1504"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Did they teach you anything when you joined them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1505"><a name="pos1505"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> No, they did not teach us anything because what we saw from them was the harassment of the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1506"><a name="pos1506"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Did you have arms of your own?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1507"><a name="pos1507"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> At that time we had arms, but not many.   I think only two.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1508"><a name="pos1508"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> When you say that time, when was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1509"><a name="pos1509"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> A explained that the SDU was formed in May.  From February until that time in May because as members of the Youth, we were afraid to go to our parents to ask for money to buy arms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1510"><a name="pos1510"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Where did you get the arms from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1511"><a name="pos1511"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> Some of our members who resided in the old township, gave us those arms.  They said because you are new, something might happen.  Now you must at least have something to protect yourselves with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1512"><a name="pos1512"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Where did you get the arms from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1513"><a name="pos1513"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> I told you Chair, that Muleleki was a new area.  Old townships where we came from, people provided us with guns.  For instance Zone 3, those people provided us with guns.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1514"><a name="pos1514"></a>	They did not give us, they borrowed us so that at the time when we have ours, we would take back theirs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1515"><a name="pos1515"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> I asked you a short question, you are giving me a long explanation.  Did you get these guns from Zone 3?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1516"><a name="pos1516"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Madasa, how many times do you want the witness to repeat one and the same question?  He has made it clear that they got those guns from the old township in Zone 3, in fact they were loaned to them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1517"><a name="pos1517"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> What type of guns were they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1518"><a name="pos1518"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> They were AK47's, two.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1519"><a name="pos1519"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Who was the custodian of those?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1520"><a name="pos1520"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> There was no one person who would take custody of those guns, they rotated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1521"><a name="pos1521"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Where did you get ammunition from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1522"><a name="pos1522"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> When we wanted ammunition, we had to go back to the old township to ask for assistance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1523"><a name="pos1523"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Were all the members of the Youth League at that time eligible to use the firearms?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1524"><a name="pos1524"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> Yes, they were eligible to use those guns according to the situation that existed in Kathlehong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1525"><a name="pos1525"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Irrespective of age?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1526"><a name="pos1526"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> The people who were given the arms, were above 16 years of age.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1527"><a name="pos1527"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> When I asked you, why did you not say only those who were above 16?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1528"><a name="pos1528"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> Repeat your question sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1529"><a name="pos1529"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> When I asked you if you were eligible to carry the guns, you said all, why did you not say only those who were above 16?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1530"><a name="pos1530"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> Maybe I did not catch your question well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1531"><a name="pos1531"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Did you have an Executive?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1532"><a name="pos1532"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> Yes Chairperson, we were under area 5 at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1533"><a name="pos1533"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Who were the members of the Executive?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1534"><a name="pos1534"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> Tulani, I do not know his surname.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1535"><a name="pos1535"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> What was he in the Executive, Tulani?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1536"><a name="pos1536"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> He was our Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1537"><a name="pos1537"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1538"><a name="pos1538"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> The deceased Vips.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1539"><a name="pos1539"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> What was he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1540"><a name="pos1540"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> He was the General Secretary of the Section.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1541"><a name="pos1541"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1542"><a name="pos1542"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> Lucky.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1543"><a name="pos1543"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Lucky who?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1544"><a name="pos1544"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> I do not know his surname Chairperson, but he is present here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1545"><a name="pos1545"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can you point him out to us please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1546"><a name="pos1546"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> Over there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1547"><a name="pos1547"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is your surname sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1548"><a name="pos1548"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAYA:</span> Maya.  Maya is my surname sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1549"><a name="pos1549"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Lucky Maya, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1550"><a name="pos1550"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> What was Mr Maya?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1551"><a name="pos1551"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> He was the Secretary for the religious affairs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1552"><a name="pos1552"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Yes, carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1553"><a name="pos1553"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> Miele was present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1554"><a name="pos1554"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> What was he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1555"><a name="pos1555"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> He was an Educator.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1556"><a name="pos1556"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Who else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1557"><a name="pos1557"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> I do not remember the others.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1558"><a name="pos1558"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Were you part of the Executive?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1559"><a name="pos1559"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> I became part of the Executive thereafter.  If I am right, it might be September or October.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1560"><a name="pos1560"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> 1993?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1561"><a name="pos1561"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1562"><a name="pos1562"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> What did you become?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1563"><a name="pos1563"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> I became the Publicity Secretary.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1564"><a name="pos1564"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> When was this Executive formed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1565"><a name="pos1565"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> I told you already that it might have been September or October, I do not have certainty to the dates because I lost some of my documents.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1566"><a name="pos1566"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> You said you became the Publicity Secretary in September or October.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1567"><a name="pos1567"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1568"><a name="pos1568"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> I am asking the Executive as a whole, because you joined later in the Executive, when was it formed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1569"><a name="pos1569"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> The whole Executive was formed in March, towards the end of March.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1570"><a name="pos1570"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Why did you not become part?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1571"><a name="pos1571"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> I did not have interest at that time to be part.  I was satisfied as a person who was MRising them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1572"><a name="pos1572"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Were you ever the Secretary General of the area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1573"><a name="pos1573"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1574"><a name="pos1574"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> In what organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1575"><a name="pos1575"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> SANCO, Civic.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1576"><a name="pos1576"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> When you were member of SANCO, did you also become a member of the ANC Youth League at the same time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1577"><a name="pos1577"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> That is correct Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1578"><a name="pos1578"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> But in your evidence in chief, right at the beginning, you said no ANC Youth member was part of the Civic?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1579"><a name="pos1579"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> I said maybe we did not understand each other, I said because the Civic was the umbrella, everybody in the township submitted to the Civic.  I would not refuse when people elect me to that position, because of what I was doing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1580"><a name="pos1580"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Were you elected to the position of ANC Youth League, even though you were part of the Civic?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1581"><a name="pos1581"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1582"><a name="pos1582"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Then why did you say no member of ANC Youth League was part of the Civic, if you are in fact so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1583"><a name="pos1583"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Sorry Mr Madasa, he did say in the follow up question immediately, that he was a member of both.  He was a member of both the Civic and the ANC Youth League.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1584"><a name="pos1584"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Thank you Mr Chair.  Did you know Ndondolo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1585"><a name="pos1585"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> I knew him a lot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1586"><a name="pos1586"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Were you close to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1587"><a name="pos1587"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> Not that much because we were not politically cooperative.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1588"><a name="pos1588"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Did you know Mnyala?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1589"><a name="pos1589"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> Yes, I knew him as the Commander of Zone 5 then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1590"><a name="pos1590"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Do you recall when Mnyala called a stay away?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1591"><a name="pos1591"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1592"><a name="pos1592"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Did you support that stay away?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1593"><a name="pos1593"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> I did not support that stay away as a member of the Civic, because I knew that they had no mandate of calling a stay away without reporting to us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1594"><a name="pos1594"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> When was that call made?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1595"><a name="pos1595"></a><span class="speaker">MR LEKABE:</span> I do not remember the date very well, but I remember it was on Monday morning when people prepared to ...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1596"><a name="pos1596"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> Which month?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1598"><a name="pos1598"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> When Mnyala called the stay away, was the ANC Youth League still part of the SDU?</p>
