<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>MICHAEL ARMOED:  (s.u.o.)</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Madasa, you had completed your examination in chief?</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Yes, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mapoma, do you have any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MAPOMA:</span> Mr Armoed, on the 7th of December 1993, when you were taking the youth to the veld, you were armed as an operator?</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Now, are there any operators who are not armed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> There was only one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Who was that one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Vusu Mthembu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Do you know of any reason why he wasn't armed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Did you not find out, as other operators, why an operator is not armed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> No, I did not establish why the other operator was not armed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Do you know Jabulani Nkmalo(?).</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> No, I don't know Jabulani Nkmalo.   I know Jabulani Ngdoese.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Is Jabulani Ngdoese in this hearing today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Yes, he is here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Can you point him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> For the record, chairperson, the person who has just been pointed is referred to in our records as Jabulani Nkmalo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So is Jabulani Ngdoese and Jabulani Nkmalo, the same persons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> I don't know about that, I know he is Ngdoese.</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just a minute, Mr Armoed, I just want to clarify the matter with Mr Mapoma.   Is Jabulani Nkmalo and Jabulani Ngdoese one and the same person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Chairperson, it's difficult because in our records, we don't have any Jabulani Ngdoese, we have Jabulani Nkmalo, and this Jabulani Nkmalo is that person who has just been pointed now as Jabulani Ngdoese by the witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Now in your evidence ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sir, Mr Nkmalo, what are your full names?   Is Jabulani your name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKMALO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you also called Jabulani Ngdoese?   Is your father Ngdoese?</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKMALO:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Thank you, chairperson.   Now, Mr Armoed, I'm going to refer to this person as Jabulani, you said in your evidence in chief that you found this person in the shack when you were from the toilet, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> And you inquired from him how did he happen to be there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Yes, I asked him what he wanted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> You're referring to Jabulani?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Were you seeing him for the first time in the shack on that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Yes, I was seeing him for the first time in that shack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Is it correct that Jabulani stays in your area in Moleleki?</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> So it is not correct that Jabulani stays somewhere else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> At that time he was staying, residing in Moleleki, and he left, I don't know where he went to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Isn't it correct that when Jabulani was abducted from his home, you were one of the people who were there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> That is not correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Jabulani will say that you were there amongst the men who took him by force from his home.    What do you say on that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> He would be telling a lie, because I was not there when he was taken, I would not have let him go.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Now, when you were on guard for the youth in Ishaga(?), who gave you instructions to be on guard?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> It was Sugar Ramebele.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Where was Sugar when you released Jabu?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Sugar was not there when I released Jabu.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is Jabu and Jabulani one and the same person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> I'm sorry, chairperson, for the record yes, it's one and the same person.   Can you explain how did you happen to release a person when you have been given instructions to keep that person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> I was not ordered to keep him, because I found him there in the shack when I came back from the toilet and I asked him what he wanted.   He then told me that he was fetched by some men at home and brought there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> And when you released the other two young, how did you release those?</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> I released the other two because Rame had instructed me that if young ones were brought here, I should release them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Now, when you, let's go to the place where the corpse of Bulelwa was lying.   You said in your evidence in chief that you left with the driver of the car, together with Njebe to, where were you going?</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> I left with Njebe to go and look for a car, we found it, we came back.   Njebe then left with Nthebo, he did not go with me in a car, I was left behind.</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> So it was Njebe, Sipho Baluang and the driver?</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Where was Mr Mthembu, who has just given evidence here?</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Mr Mthembu was not there at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Now you said Jabulani was injured when you saw him in the shack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Yes, he was injured in the arm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Did he tell you how he happened to be injured?</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Yes, he told me, he said he was beaten by one of the self defence unit members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Did he tell you who from the self defence unit injured him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> No, he said he didn't know him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Thank you chairperson, those are my questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MAPOMA</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">RE-EXAMINATION BY ADV MADASA:</span> Mr Armoed, when you released the youth that you released, you had not, had you, were you already given the order to kill him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> No, I was not given such orders.</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Had you been given an order to kill them already, would you have released them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> No, I would not have released them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Why not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Because in that case the orders would have been given already.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY ADV MADASA</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you.   Mr Sibanyoni, do you have any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Yes, thank you, Mr Chairman.   Mr Armoed, you said the NYD self defence units were formed were to protect the community.   I want to know from you, to protect the community from whom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> We were protecting the community in fear of Inkatha and gangsters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Right.   And that protection, what did it entail, what were your terms of reference, how were you to protect the community, by doing what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> We had to patrol at night, looking for Inkatha and gangsters, make sure that no-one of the community, none in the community is harassed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Now, in the event you find these gangsters and Inkatha, what were you supposed to do with them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> We would capture them and if the commander was there, he is the one who would issue an order what to do with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> In other words there were no clear indications, before those people would be arrested, what should be done with them in the event they are arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Yes, it was not clear, because we were supposed to take them to the commander if he was not nearer, and he was the one who would give an instruction as to what to do with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Mr Armoed, when the, if the Internal Stability Unit arrived, to pick up the corpse, were you present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> No, I was not there, I was watching over the boys in the shack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairperson, no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, Mr Malan?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> No questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Motata?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Thank you, chairperson.   Mr Armoed, I just have one question for you.   You say whilst escorting the comrades to the veld, they were beaten up.   Do you recall you saying that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Yes, I remember saying that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Could you give us an indication how they were assaulted whilst escorted to the veld?</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> They were beaten by sticks at the back and the buttocks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Would I be understanding you to say that you people, that is the SDU's, had assortment of weapons, including sticks, when you escorted them to the veld?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Yes, there were sticks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Are you able to give an indication who amongst your members carried such weaponry, that is sticks for instance?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> One SDU member, he is not here now, he is Manyinalese, that is his name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Are you saying then that only one member had a  stick?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> The one stick that I saw being used was only that one.   I cannot remember whether there were other sticks or not, but we usually used to carry sticks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Now those who were carrying guns, for instance AK47's, did they use such weaponry in the assault?</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> No, they did not use the guns at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Thank you, chairperson, I've got no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> You told us that you came to Moleleki section in about August 1993?</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> You were an operator, were you not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Were you trained how to use the firearm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Yes, I was trained.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> And did you take part in the activities of the SDU?</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Sometimes, if I was present, I used to take part in the activities of the SDU, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> There is an allegation by some of the witnesses, such as Jabulani Nkmalo, Thulam Hendinlolu(??), and (Indistinct) and Vuyana Tshabalala, to the effect that initially the SDU's patrolled during the night, while the Youth League patrolled in the evening.   Do you know that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> No, I don't know a thing about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> These individuals that I've mentioned, Tshabalala, Nkmalo, Maya, further allege that, despite patrols conducted by the SDU in the evening, there were bodies of individuals which were found, and that led to the dissatisfaction with the SDU.   Do you know anything about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Yes, I would like to say something about this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> They too used to patrol the whole night, together with our SDU, not that they used to patrol in the evening only, and the SDU patrol at night, no, that was not the case.   Yes, it is true, we used to hear that a person has died somewhere, and therefore it was inexplicable as to how such a person had died.   Because of that, as time went on it transpired who were doing these things.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Who were responsible for these?</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> The very same Youth League, the ANC Youth League.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Was the community of Moleleki at any stage concerned about the fact that, despite patrols that were conducted, people died in circumstances where no-one seemed to know what was the cause why these people had been killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Yes, that is correct, they were concerned.   I too was concerned about the people who were found dead, not knowing what the reason thereof is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Was there any meeting which was called by the community in order to seek an answer to this problem?</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> I wouldn't say there was a meeting convened, because I myself was not there for a very long time, I was at work, most of the time that is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> At the time where were you working?</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> I was working at Majuba Power Station in Hammarsfort.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Yes.   And how often did you come home?</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> If I had left home on the 20th, I would come back on the 15th of the following month.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> There is an allegation that some time in September 1993, a meeting of the community was called to address this problem of people dying despite the patrols, do you know of that meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> No, I don't know about that meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Were you not told of any such meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> When you returned from your place of employment, did you endeavour to find out how the problem of persons who were being killed despite the patrol had been resolved?</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> I tried to find out, and I was told the problem had not been solved, because people still died, they still continued to be killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Vuyani Tshabalala alleges that as a result of these inexplicable deaths, the Youth League decided to patrol blocks A, B, C and D.   Do you know anything about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Yes, I heard about that, that the Youth League patrols from block A to D, but as far as I saw them, they were all over the place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Did you endeavour to find out why the Youth League was patrolling A to D?</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Yes, I did ask that the Youth League patrolled from A to D, and they said they didn't want to combine with elder people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Did the SDU accept this arrangement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> The SDU did not accept this arrangement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Why not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Because they realised that there was going to be a big trouble.</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> What trouble did they have in mind?</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> The very same problem of people dying and the car hijacking, and the shooting of cars.</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> And what steps, if any, were taken by the SDU to prevent this trouble?</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> I was not there, I just heard that the SDU is now patrolling the community taxis now that they were being shot, that is the taxis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> But what did they do about the fact that the Youth League was now patrolling blocks A, B, C and D?</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> I don't know, I know there's nothing they did, they accepted the fact that the Youth League was patrolling A, B, C and D.   According to my knowledge, as I heard, they did not accept that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> What did they do to make sure that that did not happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> I don't know, it looks like they did nothing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> So even though they were not happy with the fact that the Youth League was patrolling A, B, C and D, they nevertheless did nothing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> No, I don't know whether there's something that they did, but according to my knowledge, there is nothing that they did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> They allowed the Youth League to continue patrolling A, B, C and D?</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> I don't know whether they accepted or not, but I just know they were not happy about the arrangement.   Whether they allowed them to continue, I don't know, I was not there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Do you know of any actions that were taken by the SDU to ensure that the Youth League did not patrol A, B, C and D?</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Yes, I can say they did take action to make sure that they don't patrol these areas, A, B, C and D, but all these other areas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> What steps did the SDU take?</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> They called these boys, spoke to them, talked to them and said, "Because you are patrolling from A to D, if you are all over the place, what is it that you are looking for?"</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Would you just repeat that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> SDU members, we called these boys when we came across them at night and we said, "Now that you are here in F and you should be patrolling, you are patrolling A to D".</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> So the Youth League was called and asked, "Why are you patrolling F, because as far as we know, you're supposed to patrol A to D?"</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Yes, we asked them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> So, in other words, the SDU accepted the fact that the Youth League was to patrol blocks A, B, C and D?</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Yes, I can say so, but according to my knowledge, the last time I heard they had not accepted it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> It has taken you too long to answer that question.   Now when you met them at night and asked them, "Why are you now patrolling block F as well?", what did they say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> They said they don't want to be instructed by people who come from the rural areas, we should just leave them alone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> And what was the response of the SDU?</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> We let them go and they just continued.</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Yes.   I understand that at some point there is a meeting which was held at block F, which was to discuss the formation of an SDU which was to patrol F section.   Do you know anything about that meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Yes, there is a little that I heard about this meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Yes.   What do you know about this meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> What I heard being said in that very same meeting, I was told that they were forming a new SDU.</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> This SDU was going to operate in F block?</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> The person who told me indicated that it was going to patrol block E and F.</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> If such an SDU had been formed, the result would have been that the Youth League would then be patrolling the whole of Moleleki section?</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> If it had succeeded, they would have patrolled block F only, it would not patrol the whole Moleleki section.</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Ja.   But I thought that at the time they were already patrolling block A, B, C and D?</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Will you please repeat?</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Well, you mentioned earlier on that you, the SDU accepted that the Youth League was patrolling blocks A, B, C and D?</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Now, a further meeting was held, which was to discuss the formation of an SDU which was to patrol block F, and you mentioned earlier on that, according to your information, that SDU was going to patrol E and F, right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> The new SDU was going to patrol only block F, that is if it had succeeded.</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> And this new SDU would have comprised of the Youth League?</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Yes, the Youth League would be the members of the very same new SDU.</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Now, if they had been successful in the formation of the new SDU, the end result would be that the Youth League would be patrolling the whole of Moleleki section?</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> They would not patrol the entire Moleleki section, they would only patrol section F, I mean block F, because we were in the other sections or blocks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> But, Mr Armoed, you've just told us that the Youth League was patrolling block A, B, C and D?</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Yes, I did say that, that the Youth League patrolled from A to D, and they went on to patrol in F.</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> What I'm saying to you is that if they now, if now a new SDU was being formed, which consisted of members of the Youth League, which was going to patrol E and F, the end result would be that the Youth League would then patrol whole of Moleleki section?</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> The SDU did not accept this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Do you know of any actions that were taken by the SDU to make sure that this did not happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> No, I don't know any action taken.</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Were you aware of any meetings that were held by the SDU at which it was decided what course of action had to be taken in order to prevent the Youth League from patrolling the whole of Moleleki section?</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> No, there's nothing I knew about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Now, coming to the persons that were killed on the 7th of December 1993, do you know why these individuals were killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Yes, I know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Why were they killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> They were killed because they were gangsters who had killed Bulelwa and Blanko.</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> You do know the deceased Wipstein(?)?</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Yes, I know him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Do you know how he died?</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> No, I don't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Did you know him before his death?</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Yes, I knew him before he died.</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> I understand that he was, was he a leader of the youth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Yes, he was leader of the youth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> When did you hear for the first time that he had died?</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> I cannot remember.   If I am not mistaken, it was on the 10th of December, that is when I heard that he had died.</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Did you consider him to have been the leader of what you consider to be the gangsters?</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Did you at any stage make inquiries as to how he had died?</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Yes, I tried to find out how he died.</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> What were you told?</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> I was told that he is the one who shot Bulelwa and Blanko, and he was with these people at night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Yes, but were you told how he had died?</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> No, they did not tell me how he died.</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> But did you yourself make inquiries as to how the leader of what you perceived to be the gangsters had died?</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Yes, I tried how he died, to find out how he died, but the people whom I was asking did not know how he died.</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Today do you know how he died?</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> His death and as to how he died, I only know he died because he killed Bulelwa and Blanko.</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> What I'm trying to establish is, as you are sitting here giving testimony, do you know how Vips was killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> I don't know how he was killed.   I heard that he was killed around Khumalo, or at Khumalo, and he was killed for what he had done in Moleleki Extension 2.</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Did you hear who killed him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Yes, I heard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Who killed him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> It was Manyala.</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> And who else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Koos, Koos.</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Is Koos one of the applicants?</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> No, he is not here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Did you know how they killed him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> No, I don't know how they killed him, but according to my understanding, he was found in Khumalo and they captured him there.   They asked him what he did in Extension 2, Moleleki, and he explained that "We killed Bulelwa and Blanko".</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Who told you all this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Comrade Manyala told me all this, gave me all this information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Did Comrade Manyala, by the way Comrade Manyala is now dead, is it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Did Manyala tell you precisely how they killed them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Yes, he explained a little bit how they killed him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> What did he tell you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> He told me they asked him, "Vips, why you did this?", and he explained that they were sent by Comrade Buthelezi to kill Bulelwa and Blanko, and they just took him and killed him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> And how did they kill him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> They took him to the veld where they shot him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> And did he tell you what they did with his body?</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> No, they didn't tell me what they did with his body.</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mapoma, is deceased No 11, Isaac Mbijana Motloung, the person described as Vips?</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Yes, chairperson, he's Isaac Vips, his other name is Bijan.</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Mr Armoed, did you know Vips's names?</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> What were his names?</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> I don't know his full names, I only know the name Vips.</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Chairperson, if I may be of assistance, there's a human rights violations statement which appears on page 178 onwards.   That statement, chairperson, at page 179, reflects Isaac Mbijana Vips Motloung.   The statement, chairperson, was made by Selena Dombismene Motloung.</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> No, no, I'm looking for the post-mortem report.   Yes, very well.   Now, because Vips was the leader of the Youth League, did you make any inquiries at the time when you were killing the other individuals as to where Vips was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Yes, I asked them, the other Youth League members, and they told me that they had left, they had gone to Khumalo, that is Khumalo section.</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Thank you, I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Madasa, is there anything ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Yes, just two questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">RE-EXAMINATION BY ADV MADASA:</span> Mr Armoed, sections A to D, were they an entry point to Moleleki or an exit point?</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> They were entry points when you were going to other sections, these were entry points A and B.</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> A and B was the entry point?</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Because A and B was an entry point, was it therefore strategic when one was controlling the Moleleki section?</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Yes, we can say they were strategic points.</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Why was it strategic?</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Because on entering, this was the entry point, and on leaving, this was the exit point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Was it your perception that the Youth League wanted to have control of the exit and entry point to the section?</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Yes, they wanted to control the very same place, the very same area, that is the entry and exit point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> You didn't want the Youth League to have control of that point?</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Yes, the SDU did not want these A and B entry and exit points to be controlled.</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Block F, in terms of violence coming from that (indistinct)?</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Because they were nearer to Zonke.</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> I did not see any reason, but they saw a need to do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Now, despite all these arrangements, is it true that on the surface, the Youth League was in fact patrolling the whole area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> And when the Youth League patrolled, planned to be in control of A to D, you did not cease as SDU to patrol that area, that is A to D?</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> No, we stopped patrolling, we did not patrol A to D, we stopped at C and F and D.</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> For how long did you cease to patrol A to D, or should I say did you resume to patrol that area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> We stopped patrolling that area, we continued patrolling C, A and B and F.</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Can you come again, I'm confused, which areas did you continue now to patrol if you don't, if the Youth League was patrolling A to D?</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> The places at which we continued to patrol was F and C and D and E.</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Did you ever patrol A and B again?</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> No, we didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Why not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Because the Youth League was the one patrolling those areas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> But they were also patrolling C, D and F?</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Yes, yes, they were patrolling A and C and F.</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> So why didn't you stop patrolling C, D, I mean F, C, D and E?</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> We discovered that there was a problem there, because that's where the taxis would gather, that was a taxi rank, I suppose.</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY ADV MADASA</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">FURTHER CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MAPOMA:</span> You say the deceased were killed because they were gangsters, and they killed Bulelwa and Blanko?</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Now, Mrs Buthelezi, was she a gangster?</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> No, I don't know why she was killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> And you were present when she was killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> No, I was not there, I was standing far away on the road.</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> But those who killed her were from your company?</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Now on their way back, did they tell you why they killed her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mapoma, does that question arise from the questions put by the committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Well, chairperson, it arose from the reason why these people were killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I see, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> You have said that you didn't know how Vips was killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> And you only learnt on the 10th of December that in fact Vips was killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Now when you were on guard of the youth in the shack, isn't it correct that Nthebo came?</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Yes, Nthebo came.</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Isn't it correct that Nthebo reported that they have since killed Vips?</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> No, he did not report that to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Jabulani Nkmalo will say that while they were kept in the shacks, no, I'm sorry, it's not Jabulani Nkmalo, chairperson if you can just bear with me?   Charles Mkwena will say that while they were still kept in the shack, Jabu came and reported that they have since killed Vips.</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> I don't know anything about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Thank you, chairperson.</p>

<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you, I understand that when you were issued with these firearms at the beginning of the patrol, the bullets were counted, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did anyone count the bullets in your AK47 on the 7th of December 1993?</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you recall how many were there, before the shooting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Yes, I remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How many were there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Ten of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And did you use all those bullets on the deceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Yes, I used them all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr Armoed, you said that you knew Vips as the leader of the gangsters?</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> The objective of the killing was to protect the community, and therefore you had to kill the gangsters, that was the order?</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Was it not funny that the leader of the gangsters were not amongst them, didn't that strike you as strange?</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> No, it did not surprise me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Because Comrade Oscar did say that he saw them among the gangsters when they went to shoot and kill Comrade Blanko.</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Who did he say, that he saw them amongst the gangsters?</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Yes, Comrade Oscar says he saw them among the gangsters who killed Bulelwa and that comrade was Comrade Vips.</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Let me rephrase my question.   My question is, Comrade Vips was seen amongst the gangsters, according to Comrade Oscar?</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> When you eventually capture the gangsters and they are killed, Vips is not among them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Yes, he is not there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did you ask why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Yes, I did ask, and they said he had gone, he had gone to Khumalo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Who did you ask?</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> I asked the very same boys, the gangsters.</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did you take this up with any of your comrades in the SDU, did you ask any of them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> No, I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Would one not have expected that some of the members of the SDU would have said, "Well we have all these gangsters here, but where is their leader?"</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> No, we were not expecting that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Why not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Because the leader of the gangsters had already fled to Khumalo section.</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr Armoed, you heard the evidence that Vips was brought with a kombi to the meeting, can you recall that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Yes, I did hear that he was brought to the meeting in a kombi, but I did not see him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Now, you ask the boys about Vips, but you don't mention it to your comrades?</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> It is because I only heard later that Vips was there in a kombi, that time during which I was in the shack watching over the boys, and I was told that Vips was there in the meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So you never spoke to your comrades about the absence of Vips at the time that the other youngsters were kept in the shack through to the time that they were killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> No, I did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The only comrade that you came across at the shack was Shongwe, who you had asked to look after the boys whilst you had gone to the toilet, right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MR ARMOED:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Madasa, is there anything that you want to canvass further?</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> No, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mapoma?</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, very well, thank you, Mr Armoed, you may return to your seat.   Yes, Mr Madasa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Mr Chair, if you may recall yesterday, you requested that we make a list of people who were captured during the attack.   I have some names in front of me here.  I don't know if I'm ..(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Okay.   Is that the list of persons whom the applicants admit having abducted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Yes, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Would you read the list into the record please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Firstly, a list of the victims are obviously people who were also captured by the applicants, except for Julia Buthelezi, Bullewa Zwane, that is except for deceased No 1 and 3.   And then, in addition to that list are the following:  Tusanang Lukabe, Mtabang Lukwena, Jabu Ngdoese, Vuyani ...(intervention).</p>

<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Yes, yes.   Jan Tshabalala, Henry Nkamalo, Olf Zenamavu.   Mr Chair, I wish to point out that this list are the names of people the applicants were able to recall, it doesn't mean there could be no other people which they left out and so on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, I understand that, yes.   So you really have given us five names, including the deceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, very well, you may proceed.</p>

<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> To other blocks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> With whom did you go to look for others?</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> It was Michael Sonti, Sugar Ramebele, Oscar Motlokwa and Moses August.   Those are the names I'm able to remember. ...(tape ends)</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a>	...bringing this first group, the other group did not arrive yet, so went back to look for others.</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> The persons that you have just mentioned, that is Michael Sonte, Oscar Motlokwa and Moses August, were these the persons who were in your group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> Yes, we were in one group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Where did you go?</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> We went to block A.</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Whom did you find, if any?</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> We found Tusanang.</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> And who else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> When we returned with Tusanang, we found Jabulani Nkmalo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Where did you find Nkmalo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> We found him in one of the shacks, I don't know actually it was his home, but in the shacks where we found him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> What did you do with them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> We took them to block F.</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Are those the only people that you found?</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> Yes, those are the people we were able to find.</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> How did you escort them back to the shack in block F?</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> We were driving them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Did you assault them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> The one who was injured was Jabulani Nkmalo, on the arm, he was stabbed with a spear on the arm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Who stabbed him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> I don't remember well, but I think it's either Comrade Sonte or Comrade Mashinini, I don't remember who between these two.</p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Who had a spear amongst you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> Comrade Sonte was having, Comrade Sonte and Mashinini had spears, I had an axe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> So you returned then to the shack.   And then what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> We took them to the shack.   Whilst they were there being interrogated, I was outside.   After some time, others were taken by some comrades when it was light.</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Is there anything that you did, that you were involved in after you had taken Tsonang and Nkmalo to the shack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> My role was when they were taken to the place where they were killed, I was there, I was present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> When you returned to F on the second occasion, you had two persons, namely Tsonang and Jabulani Nkmalo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Do you know how many persons were already in the shack at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> This I know were two, it was Makobong and the one I did not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Were there any others who had been captured by the other group?</p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> Others arrived late, they were brought by Comrade Sugar and other comrades.</p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> How many were there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> I don't remember well, I think there were three.</p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Yes, thank you.   Now, you said you were present when these people were taken to be killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> Yes, I was present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> How did that come about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> The order came from the commander that they should be taken to the veld and be killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Who was the commander?</p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> Dondolo Mchebe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Were you present when the order was issued?</p>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> I was a little bit aside, but I only became aware when they were taken out of the shack, then I learnt that the order has been given that they should be taken to the veld to be killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> And then you went along?</p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Why did you go along?</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> Because I was a member of the SDU.   When the order is issued, I'm part of those people who should carry that order.</p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> You were carrying the order?   Were you carrying the order?</p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> That is correct, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> And did you kill anybody?</p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> After they were shot, what, I took part in the killing of Buthelezi, Buthelezi the elder.</p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> With what did you kill him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> After he was being shot, the commander ordered that those who have axes should finish them off, then I did that with my axe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Mr Buthelezi is the only person you finished off with your axe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> Yes, he's the only one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> And then what did you do afterwards?</p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> After that, we left after others finished others off, then we went back to the village.</p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Did you leave all at the same time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> Yes, we left all at the same time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Where did you personally go to, after you had finished?</p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> We left as a group.   On the road, the commander said we should wait there.   He went with Comrade Sugar to a certain house, I think it was Buthelezi's house, then after that we heard gunshots.</p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Who exactly went into the shack which you thought was Buthelezi's?</p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> It's Ntebe Dondolo and Sugar Ramebele.</p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Were they armed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> Ntebe Dondolo had a shotgun, and Sugar Ramebele had a shotgun also.</p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> And then what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> When they returned, they ordered that we should go and search for others, whom we did not find.</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Did you go?</p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> Yes, we left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Where to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> We went to C block.</p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Did you find anything there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> We found Mtabang Lukwene.   He was left because it was said that he's young.</p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> You found him and left him where you found him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> We took him so that he'll be able to identify others, where they were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Did he show you others?</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> No, we did not find any until we arrived at the shack where they used to stay, where they stayed as a gang.  When we arrived there, we did not find anybody.</p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Are there any other, did you see any items there, at those shacks where they used to live?</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> Yes, there were things there, things like hi-fi's, TV's, etcetera.</p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Then what did you do with Mtabang</p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> He was told to leave, because we did not find others.</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> After you had released him, did you go anywhere else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> No, that's where I left and went home to sleep.</p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Do you know the ANC Youth League?</p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> Yes, I know ANC Youth League.</p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> What was your view about them, as the SDU?</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> I regarded ANC Youth League as part of us, because I was also a member of the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> The people you captured, do you know to which organisation they belonged?</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> I did not know which organisation they belonged.</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> The people that you killed, did you know what organisation they belonged to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> I heard that they were members of the ANC Youth League, but I did not have facts about that, and especially in regard to activities they were engaged in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> What activities were they engaged in, the people you killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> Like taking people and killing people, to hijack people's cars, to loot spaza shops, those are the things which made not to believe that they were not members of the ANC Youth League, that I did not understand that those things are part of the code of conduct of the ANC Youth League, that people should be killed and should be, people should be, their property should be looted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Now, what did you hope to achieve by killing those people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> By killing these people we were trying to achieve peace, so that the community should live in peace.</p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> How would the community have peace by killing those people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> Because things which were happening then, that people were killed and people's property was stolen, did not happen after the killing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> When you killed these individuals, who did you think you were killing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> I was thinking that we're killing the enemy of the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Why were they the enemy of the community?</p>
<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> In regard to their activities in harassing the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Before the killing had you heard who was responsible for Bulelwa and Blanko's deaths?</p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> No sir, I did not hear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Were you aware that they were dead?</p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> I only learnt when we captured those people that I was able to see that they were responsible for the killing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> When you captured them, did you interrogate them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> Yes, we interrogated them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> What did they say about the killings of Bulelwa and Blanko?</p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> They said it's Vips and Tusanang who did that, and they were present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> As far as you were aware at the time, did Inkatha, IFP, have any hand on the activities of the ANC Youth League?</p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> Perhaps I would say that, because Inkatha was giving money and weapons by the boers.   If they are able to associate themselves with some members of the ANC Youth League who do not understand the constitution and the activities of the ANC Youth League, they would do the work of the IFP.</p>
<p class="line" id="line546"><a name="pos546"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Did you think the Instability Unit had anything to do with the Youth League?</p>
<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> I did not believe that they had a hand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line548"><a name="pos548"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Were you aware what kind of weapons the Youth League used?</p>
<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> They were using these long guns which were used by the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Did you therefore suspect that the, where did you think they obtained those firearms from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> I don't know where they found those guns.</p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> But they are guns that resembled those of the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> Yes, they were similar to those used by the police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> As a result of your participation in the killings, did you benefit anything there personally?</p>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> No, there was no benefit I gained.</p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Before you went to look for the people that you captured later on, were you told to do so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> When we extinguished Comrade Blanko's shack, Madikezele, as a member of the committee, and Sugar, as a member of the executive committee present there, of the SDU, instructed us that we should go and capture those people who are responsible for these deeds.</p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY ADV MADASA</p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MAPOMA:</span> Do you know why Motobane Mkgenwa was released from those captured?</p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> When a number of youth were held ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> No, what's the answer to the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> Can you repeat your question, sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Do you know why Motobane Mkgenwa was released from those who were captured?</p>
<p class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> I already said that he was released because he was younger among them all when they were arrested, being two, they were released both of them, because they said they were younger among those who have been captured.</p>
<p class="line" id="line566"><a name="pos566"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Who ordered that they be released?</p>
<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> I don't know, I was outside, I only saw them when they were released from the shack and they left, both of them, I don't know who instructed that they should be released.</p>
<p class="line" id="line568"><a name="pos568"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Then how did you know the reason why they were released?</p>
<p class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> I asked others that why were those released?</p>
<p class="line" id="line570"><a name="pos570"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mapoma, is it an issue that these young persons were released?</p>
<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> No, not that one is not in issue, but there is an issue in eight, because there are allegations as to why they released those people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But to the witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> There are allegations that you released those youths whom you released because they were not in the hit list, what do you say on that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> I don't know about the hit list, I did not hear about the hit list within the SDU.</p>
<p class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Now after they were killed, you said there was an order that those who have axes must finish them off, is it so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> That is correct, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Do you know of any other person amongst the applicants who participated in finishing them off?</p>
<p class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> Yes, there are those I know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Who are they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> Thobile Luphindo, Patrick Mokoena, Moses August and Shongwe, those are the ones I remember, I don't know as to whether there were others, but I remember these ones well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Do you know how Victor Malinmoetse happened to lose his head?</p>
<p class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> I don't know, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The time now is just after 11 o'clock, at an appropriate time would you indicate so that we can take the tea adjournment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Thank you, chairperson, I think I won't be long, I'll take about five to ten minutes, in fact five minutes, not more than five minutes with this witness and thereafter I think we could ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line585"><a name="pos585"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, all right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line586"><a name="pos586"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> You said when you killed these people, you thought that you were killing the enemy of the community?</p>
<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> I said so, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line588"><a name="pos588"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Did you hear from the community that these people are enemies of the community?</p>
<p class="line" id="line589"><a name="pos589"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> The community did not say, but according to their activities I perceived them as the enemy of the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> And you are referring to their alleged criminal activities?</p>
<p class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> Yes, for example in the morning when we wake up, we would find that people were burnt in their shacks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> You said you thought they don't know the constitution of the ANC Youth League, did you know the constitution or the policy of the ANC, you as a member of the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line593"><a name="pos593"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> According to my knowledge, a member of the ANC cannot harass the community where he lives, that is why the way they were behaving themselves, they were not loyal to the constitution of the ANC, but they were doing gangster activities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line594"><a name="pos594"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Now according to the policy of the ANC, can a member of the ANC kill a supporter or a member of the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> No sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line596"><a name="pos596"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Thank you, no further questions, chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line597"><a name="pos597"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MAPOMA</p>
<p class="line" id="line598"><a name="pos598"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Sibanyoni, do you have any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line599"><a name="pos599"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairperson, I have one or two questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line600"><a name="pos600"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, all right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line601"><a name="pos601"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Mr Nkomo, these people who were killed on the veld, do you agree they were members of the ANC Youth League?</p>
<p class="line" id="line602"><a name="pos602"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> I don't believe that they were members of the ANC Youth League, because of their criminal activities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line603"><a name="pos603"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Do their criminal activities make them not to be members of the ANC Youth League?</p>
<p class="line" id="line604"><a name="pos604"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> That is correct, their criminal activities shows that they were in disguise that they were in the membership of the ANC Youth League.</p>
<p class="line" id="line605"><a name="pos605"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> When the ISU, Instability, I mean Internal Stability Unit, arrived at Bulelwa or Blanko's house to collect the corpse, were you present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line606"><a name="pos606"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> I was next to the shack where they were kept, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line607"><a name="pos607"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> When these youth were driven or taken to the veld, I reckon it was already broad daylight?</p>
<p class="line" id="line608"><a name="pos608"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> Yes, it was daylight.</p>
<p class="line" id="line609"><a name="pos609"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Where was the members of the communities, were not other people around who perhaps tried to intervene that these people should not be taken to the veld?</p>
<p class="line" id="line610"><a name="pos610"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> No, there were people who were trying to intervene, because after the Stability Unit left, all those people disbursed.   When we drove them to the veld, there were no people around.</p>
<p class="line" id="line611"><a name="pos611"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Thank you, no further questions, Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line612"><a name="pos612"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.   Mr Malan, do you have any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line613"><a name="pos613"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> No questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line614"><a name="pos614"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you.   Mr Motata?</p>
<p class="line" id="line615"><a name="pos615"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Mr Chair, I'll rather put questions after the tea break.</p>
<p class="line" id="line616"><a name="pos616"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We'll take a tea break now, we will return at half past eleven.</p>
<p class="line" id="line617"><a name="pos617"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line618"><a name="pos618"></a><span class="speaker">LANGA MICHAEL NKOMO:</span> (s.u.o.)</p>
<p class="line" id="line619"><a name="pos619"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, Mr Motata?</p>
<p class="line" id="line620"><a name="pos620"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Thank you, chairperson.   Mr Nkomo, this question of gangsterism existed before the 7th of December 1993, would I be wrong if I said so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line621"><a name="pos621"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> Yes, it was long in existence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line622"><a name="pos622"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> And we know that prior to that, the 7th of December 1993, there were people dying and some, as you said, burnt in their shacks, isn't it so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line623"><a name="pos623"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line624"><a name="pos624"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> And prior to the 7th of December 1993, no action was taken against the gangsters?</p>
<p class="line" id="line625"><a name="pos625"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> It was once tried to call the members of the so-called Youth League to discuss these activities.   Then they separated themselves from the SDU, they decided to be  independent, because they were told that criminal activities are not wanted in the community, they must actually protect the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line626"><a name="pos626"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> This Vips, we know that he was the leader of what you term gangsters?</p>
<p class="line" id="line627"><a name="pos627"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> Yes, he was the leader.</p>
<p class="line" id="line628"><a name="pos628"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Was any action taken prior to the 7th of December 1993 against him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line629"><a name="pos629"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> I remember that the executive of the SDU called them, they called the executive of the youth, they sat around the table to discuss the situation, and the report that we got was that they reported to them, but well they don't know whether they will stop with their acts of taking people's property.   I remember at one stage block D called a meeting, it was only men and the youth, and they were being warned to stop taking people's properties, hijacking cars and killing people just on the basis of a suspicion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line630"><a name="pos630"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> If, or rather let me put it this way, were those who were doing the hijackings identified amongst the so-called ANC Youth League?</p>
<p class="line" id="line631"><a name="pos631"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> Yes, together with Vips, those are the people responsible for these criminal acts.   For instance the killing of Majosi with his two cousins and the looting of his shop, they came to the executive of the SDU asking for forgiveness, they said they heard that Majosi was a member of Inkatha.</p>
<p class="line" id="line632"><a name="pos632"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> After these meetings which were where they were warned and they asked for forgiveness, did these acts of criminality continue?</p>
<p class="line" id="line633"><a name="pos633"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> That is correct, they continued.</p>
<p class="line" id="line634"><a name="pos634"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> And no action was taken after warning was given to them, no action was taken?</p>
<p class="line" id="line635"><a name="pos635"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> The action that I remember that was taken, they were told not to patrol at night anymore, they must only patrol during the day, because when they patrol at night, people die.</p>
<p class="line" id="line636"><a name="pos636"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> As far as you know, did they stop patrolling at night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line637"><a name="pos637"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> They stopped for a while, but during our patrol at night, we met them patrolling.</p>
<p class="line" id="line638"><a name="pos638"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> And you did nothing when you met them at night patrolling?</p>
<p class="line" id="line639"><a name="pos639"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> No sir, we just left them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line640"><a name="pos640"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Would you explain to us why, on the 6th of December 1993, you decided on this drastic action to now run them up, what was the reason therefor?</p>
<p class="line" id="line641"><a name="pos641"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> The reason was that they killed Bulelwa and the chairman of the SDU, Comrade Blanko, these were the things they have been reprimanded for, they were told to stop such actions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line642"><a name="pos642"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> And Comrade Blanko was chairman of the SDU's, hence you said, "Now enough is enough"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line643"><a name="pos643"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> That is correct, he was the chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line644"><a name="pos644"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Now you mentioned names Makobong, Sonte, Michael Armoed and others when you went out to look for these people.   Did you know who you were going to look for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line645"><a name="pos645"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> No, I did not know who we were looking for, we were going to search for those whom we would find, and anything that would trace them to the incident.   I already told you about those we caught in possession of the cigarette cartons, Vusi and Tusanang, they confirmed that they were together at Blanko's house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line646"><a name="pos646"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Before this search for these people, did you ask your comrades which people you were going to look for, for instance people who killed Comrade Blanko?</p>
<p class="line" id="line647"><a name="pos647"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> I did not ask.</p>
<p class="line" id="line648"><a name="pos648"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Other than those you mentioned, how many of you were in your group when you went out to look for these people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line649"><a name="pos649"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> I do not remember the others.   I could have given you all the names when I gave you those I have mentioned, others I do not remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line650"><a name="pos650"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> More or less what I want from you is not the other names, you told us that you don't remember their names, but more or less of how many people did your group consist of?</p>
<p class="line" id="line651"><a name="pos651"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> I think we were around eight, if not nine.</p>
<p class="line" id="line652"><a name="pos652"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Those who emerged from the veld next to block C, when you captured them, did you just march them back to block F?</p>
<p class="line" id="line653"><a name="pos653"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> Yes, we just caught them and then we escorted them to block F, they were not touched, we were only asking them questions and they gave us explanations that the goods in their position were taken from Blanko.</p>
<p class="line" id="line654"><a name="pos654"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> And the group which consisted of more or less eight people had assortments of weapons with, and if we may mention you, you had an axe with, would that not be right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line655"><a name="pos655"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> Yes, I had an axe.   That is an axe I used that other side when they were killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line656"><a name="pos656"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> And your objective when you wanted to capture these people were to take them back to block F, do I understand you correctly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line657"><a name="pos657"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> Yes, we were taking them to block F where they committed these crimes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line658"><a name="pos658"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Now would you tell us the difference between the two who emerged from the veld from block C and when you eventually captured Jabulani Nkmalo, why Jabulani was now injured, because that was not the aim, to assault anybody but to take them to block F?</p>
<p class="line" id="line659"><a name="pos659"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> It's a mistake that Jabulani was injured, because when we arrived, others disputed the fact that he was present, they said no, he was not involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line660"><a name="pos660"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Tusanang was captured, isn't it so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line661"><a name="pos661"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line662"><a name="pos662"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Was he taken to the shack where the others were kept?</p>
<p class="line" id="line663"><a name="pos663"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> That is correct, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line664"><a name="pos664"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Would you explain how he managed, because we have evidence to the effect that he ran away, how he ran away when he was kept with the others in the shack, according to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line665"><a name="pos665"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> One member of the executive committee of the SDU, Mr Michael Sonti, took him out of the shack, he said he must not be tied with the others, he must be taken before the community to give them an explanation, because everybody was pointing a finger at him, that himself and Buthelezi were actually pushing them behind.  ...(tape ends)</p>
<p class="line" id="line666"><a name="pos666"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Let's get to the incident of the massacre on the 7th of December 1993.   Amongst the weaponry, there were AK47's, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line667"><a name="pos667"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line668"><a name="pos668"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> And these people were shot at after having been ordered to sit down, isn't it so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line669"><a name="pos669"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line670"><a name="pos670"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> When you were ordered, for instance, to use your axe on Buthelezi senior, after being shot, was he still alive?</p>
<p class="line" id="line671"><a name="pos671"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> He was still moving, it's an indication that he was still alive, he was shot at the head.</p>
<p class="line" id="line672"><a name="pos672"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Could you probably, because you admitted that you used your axe on him, where precisely on the head was he shot?</p>
<p class="line" id="line673"><a name="pos673"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> I think he was shot right at the back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line674"><a name="pos674"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> When they were ordered to sit down, were they facing you people, that is the SDU's who were to finish them off?</p>
<p class="line" id="line675"><a name="pos675"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> They were facing the opposite direction, members of the SDU were behind them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line676"><a name="pos676"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Explain this to me, or us rather, you, at some stage, patrolled with the Youth League, that is the ANC Youth League, you formed one unit, isn't it so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line677"><a name="pos677"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line678"><a name="pos678"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> And they subsequently separated themselves from you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line679"><a name="pos679"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> Yes, subsequently they separated themselves from us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line680"><a name="pos680"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> There were allegations that the people who committed criminal acts were these people who had separated themselves from you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line681"><a name="pos681"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> It appeared so, because even during the time when we operated together, they would be in possession of a car and we would ask them, "Guys, where did you get this car?", they won't give us a reply, but at a later stage when we investigate, you would find that this car was hijacked from someone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line682"><a name="pos682"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Did you have concrete evidence against them, that is the ANC Youth League, that they committed these acts of criminality, or you suspected them to have committed such acts?</p>
<p class="line" id="line683"><a name="pos683"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> I was unemployed during that time, I saw them driving these cars, I saw them getting into tuckshops, looting people's properties, I saw them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line684"><a name="pos684"></a>	And if action against them was intended, it was easy to identify them and take action that they do not proceed with these acts of criminality, for instance handing them over to the police, because you had identified these people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line685"><a name="pos685"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> There was no co-operation with the police at that time, I hope you know the situation that was in place at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line686"><a name="pos686"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Let's suppose you wanted to stop these acts of criminality and you were not co-operating with the police, how did you intend to deal with the people who were committing these acts of criminality?</p>
<p class="line" id="line687"><a name="pos687"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> I believe it is one of the reasons, or it is a reason why they were captured, because after they were killed, the crime stopped and the police were not involved here, all the killings and the lootings stopped.</p>
<p class="line" id="line688"><a name="pos688"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Had there, it might border on speculation, had these acts continued, whoever was captured would be killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line689"><a name="pos689"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> If these people were not killed, these actions would have carried on, they were reprimanded on several occasions, but they did not want to listen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line690"><a name="pos690"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Thank you, Mr Chair, I've got no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line691"><a name="pos691"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The people that you killed were the people that you believed were engaged in criminal activities in Moleleki section?</p>
<p class="line" id="line692"><a name="pos692"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line693"><a name="pos693"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So when you killed these people, you believed that you were really killing criminals?</p>
<p class="line" id="line694"><a name="pos694"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line695"><a name="pos695"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> These individuals that you killed did not come from the hostels, right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line696"><a name="pos696"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> Yes, that's right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line697"><a name="pos697"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> They were not members of the IFP, right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line698"><a name="pos698"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> I do not know whether they had an association with the IFP, but they pronounced themselves members of the ANC, but we were not sure as to whether they were members of the ANC Youth League according to what they were doing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line699"><a name="pos699"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you have any information which suggested that they were members of the IFP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line700"><a name="pos700"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line701"><a name="pos701"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is there anything arising, Mr Madasa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line702"><a name="pos702"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Yes, Mr Chair, just on the last question that you asked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line703"><a name="pos703"></a><span class="speaker">RE-EXAMINATION BY ADV MADASA:</span> When you say you did not have information if these people were associated with the IFP, are you saying you personally, or are you saying the SDU, as a unit, did not have that information?</p>
<p class="line" id="line704"><a name="pos704"></a><span class="speaker">MR NKOMO:</span> I had never received any information to that effect, I personally did not have that knowledge, I don't know whether other members of the SDU knew that they were associated with the IFP.</p>

<p class="line" id="line823"><a name="pos823"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I thought at that stage they were already in a shack?   Were you going to remove them from that shack and put them into some other shack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line824"><a name="pos824"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> They were at a place where Bulelwa had been shot, next to a shack, they were not yet tied up at that time.</p>

<p class="line" id="line828"><a name="pos828"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> You are correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line829"><a name="pos829"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> This other shack where they were eventually taken into, in which block was that one?   Was it the same area, (indistinct) block?</p>
<p class="line" id="line830"><a name="pos830"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> It was in the same area, but next to the veld.</p>
<p class="line" id="line831"><a name="pos831"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Were you told why they were taken to that other shack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line832"><a name="pos832"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> No, we were not told.</p>
<p class="line" id="line833"><a name="pos833"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Yes, then you took them to the shack next to the forest, and then what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line834"><a name="pos834"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> Yes, we drove them to that other shack, they were walking freely, but guarded on all sides, and when we arrived there, they were put into a shack.</p>

<p class="line" id="line836"><a name="pos836"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> Myself and Mtabang and some of the comrades remained outside while the others went into the shack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line837"><a name="pos837"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> How many were they as they were being driven to this other shack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line838"><a name="pos838"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> I do not remember well how many they were, but they might have been 11, 8, 9 to 11.</p>
<p class="line" id="line839"><a name="pos839"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Was Bulelwa Zwane and Julia Buthelezi amongst them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line840"><a name="pos840"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you asking him whether Bulelwa Zwane was amongst these persons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line841"><a name="pos841"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> I know, Mr Chair, that, I know that they were not amongst, I just want it for the record, to ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line842"><a name="pos842"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But we know that Bulelwa was dead at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line843"><a name="pos843"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Thank you, Mr Chair.   Right, so you arrived there at the second shack.   You and Mtabang remained outside.   Yes, take us from there, what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line844"><a name="pos844"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> We asked Mtabang why they killed Blanko and Bulelwa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line845"><a name="pos845"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line846"><a name="pos846"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> Mtabang told me something, he said, "We're going to steadily but surely hit you".</p>
<p class="line" id="line847"><a name="pos847"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line848"><a name="pos848"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> And he told me those words before this incident, and then I said to him, "Mtabang, in other words you were right when you told me that you were going to hit us?", he said, "Yes, we were actually aiming at all the members of the SDU".</p>
<p class="line" id="line849"><a name="pos849"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line850"><a name="pos850"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> Thereafter, Mr Mchebe and Mr Mbele arrived.

<p class="line" id="line873"><a name="pos873"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Did you shoot specific people, or did you shoot in general?</p>
<p class="line" id="line874"><a name="pos874"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> We were shooting in general.</p>
<p class="line" id="line875"><a name="pos875"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line876"><a name="pos876"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> Whilst shooting, the commander ordered us to stop and those who had pangas, axes and assegaais were ordered to finish them off.</p>
<p class="line" id="line877"><a name="pos877"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line878"><a name="pos878"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> They did as they were told, and thereafter they reported that they are finished their work and the commander said we must go back to the township.   We left together with the commander and we headed for block F, then the commander said to us, he said Kenny must give him his gun, then Kenny said to him, "But the gun is empty, there are no bullets left", that's Rooivark, that's Armoed, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line879"><a name="pos879"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line880"><a name="pos880"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> And it was not true, there were still bullets in the gun, and I said to him, "No, mine is still loaded".   He then took my gun.</p>
<p class="line" id="line881"><a name="pos881"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Are you saying that there were still bullets in the AK47 which Kenny had?</p>
<p class="line" id="line882"><a name="pos882"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> Kenny's gun was empty, Kenny's gun was empty, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line883"><a name="pos883"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line884"><a name="pos884"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> He then took my gun, together with Mr Mvembe, called Ramabele, got into one shack.   After a few minutes, we heard gunshots twice.</p>
<p class="line" id="line885"><a name="pos885"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line886"><a name="pos886"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> They came out, they came to us and they said, "Let us go".   We then left together with them.   We met a boy called Mtabang at C.</p>
<p class="line" id="line887"><a name="pos887"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line888"><a name="pos888"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> We asked him to show us where the other boys stayed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line889"><a name="pos889"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line890"><a name="pos890"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> He pointed out the places until we kicked the door and we were inside, but there was nobody in.   We searched, looking for what was inside.   We did not find anybody at the other shacks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line891"><a name="pos891"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Is there any other person that you found during your search?</p>
<p class="line" id="line892"><a name="pos892"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> Nobody, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line893"><a name="pos893"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Did you find any items at those shacks?</p>
<p class="line" id="line894"><a name="pos894"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> No sir, we didn't find anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line895"><a name="pos895"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Did you find any goods during the search?</p>
<p class="line" id="line896"><a name="pos896"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> Goods belonging to who?   I don't understand your question?   Goods belonging to the owners of the shack or which goods are you referring to, sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line897"><a name="pos897"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Did you see any goods, regardless of the owner?</p>
<p class="line" id="line898"><a name="pos898"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What Mr Shongwe is trying to clarify from you is, what goods are you referring to?   Because he wouldn't know whose goods they are, (indistinct) at the other shack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line899"><a name="pos899"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Did you find any goods which you thought did not belong to them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line900"><a name="pos900"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line901"><a name="pos901"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> You found their goods?</p>
<p class="line" id="line902"><a name="pos902"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line903"><a name="pos903"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> What goods were they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line904"><a name="pos904"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> Clothing, sir, video machines, television sets, and so on.   There were car engines in there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line905"><a name="pos905"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Do you know if those goods indeed belonged to them, like they bought them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line906"><a name="pos906"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> I would not have the certainty, I found the goods in their shack, so it must have belonged to them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line907"><a name="pos907"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Were you suspicious as to how they acquired them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line908"><a name="pos908"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Madasa, but how many times must a witness tell you that he had no idea who they belonged to, he found them at their shack and he assumed that they must have been theirs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line909"><a name="pos909"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Thank you, Mr Chair.   And from there, where did you go to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line910"><a name="pos910"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> We then left for block A.</p>
<p class="line" id="line911"><a name="pos911"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line912"><a name="pos912"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> We then got into this other house, I just forget the boy's name who stayed there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line913"><a name="pos913"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line914"><a name="pos914"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> We found his mother at home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line915"><a name="pos915"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line916"><a name="pos916"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> His mother told us that he left the previous night, she has not seen him.   We then released Mtabang.  We also dispersed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line917"><a name="pos917"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Do you know why these people were captured and killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line918"><a name="pos918"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> I have (indistinct), I have an indication as to why were they killed.   They were killed because they killed Blanko and Bulelwa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line919"><a name="pos919"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Were you told that that was the reason?</p>
<p class="line" id="line920"><a name="pos920"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> I was not told, but when I arrived in the morning, many people were complaining about the killing of Bulelwa and Blanko, that is the reason maybe why they were killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line921"><a name="pos921"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Why did you personally participate in the capturing and killing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line922"><a name="pos922"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> Because of our commander's order.</p>
<p class="line" id="line923"><a name="pos923"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Was it your tradition in the SDU to question commands?</p>
<p class="line" id="line924"><a name="pos924"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> There was nothing to say to the commander, if an order was issued out, you would not stand against that order, you were expected to execute that order.</p>
<p class="line" id="line925"><a name="pos925"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Were you not allowed to inquire as to the reason for the command?</p>
<p class="line" id="line926"><a name="pos926"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Madasa, Mr Shongwe has just told us that once the commander had issued the order, that's the end of the matter, the order must be carried out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line927"><a name="pos927"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Could you refuse to carry out that order?</p>
<p class="line" id="line928"><a name="pos928"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line929"><a name="pos929"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If you did, what would happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line930"><a name="pos930"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> you would be killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line931"><a name="pos931"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Before these people were killed, did you know if they belonged to an organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line932"><a name="pos932"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> I knew.</p>
<p class="line" id="line933"><a name="pos933"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Which ones?</p>
<p class="line" id="line934"><a name="pos934"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> We patrolled together as SDU's.</p>
<p class="line" id="line935"><a name="pos935"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Which organisation did you know them to belong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line936"><a name="pos936"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> All of us were members of the Youth League.</p>
<p class="line" id="line937"><a name="pos937"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> And if you were all members of the same organisation, why were they killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line938"><a name="pos938"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> It's because they killed Bulelwa and Blanko.</p>
<p class="line" id="line939"><a name="pos939"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Did you know of any other activities they were involved in besides the issue of Blanko and Bulelwa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line940"><a name="pos940"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> Yes, there are incidents.   They were looting the tuckshops, they were shooting at the taxis, they were hijacking people's cars, then selling their parts.   During the patrol time, they killed people, that is at night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line941"><a name="pos941"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Did you...(tape ends)</p>
<p class="line" id="line942"><a name="pos942"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> It was part of my duty, I was an operator, I was protecting the community, so I perceived that as part of my work.</p>
<p class="line" id="line943"><a name="pos943"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> How was the community going to be protected by that execution of your duties?</p>
<p class="line" id="line944"><a name="pos944"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> They were criminals in the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line945"><a name="pos945"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Besides them having killed Blanko and Bulelwa and also being criminals, is there any other reason, anything as that you heard against them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line946"><a name="pos946"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> I have mentioned the things they did.   Before that incident of killing Bulelwa and Blanko, long before that, it was on a Friday ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line947"><a name="pos947"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line948"><a name="pos948"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> ...it was a Friday when they removed their goods from their shacks.   Those were the shacks situated in block D.</p>
<p class="line" id="line949"><a name="pos949"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> And what did they do with their goods?</p>
<p class="line" id="line950"><a name="pos950"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> They were removing them to the other side.   Maybe it was an indication that something was to follow thereafter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line951"><a name="pos951"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Yes, besides the removal of their things, what else did they do, indicating that something was to follow?</p>
<p class="line" id="line952"><a name="pos952"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> They drove their stolen cars into the ditch.  After that, they just left one car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line953"><a name="pos953"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line954"><a name="pos954"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> On Saturday, ten o'clock in the morning, they arrived in that bakkie, the bakkie that they did not drive into the ditch, Vips was among them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line955"><a name="pos955"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line956"><a name="pos956"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> Mavuso was present and Thabo.   I have forgotten the others.   They arrived at us, we were four in number, they went to Comrade Sugar ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line957"><a name="pos957"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Was Sugar with you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line958"><a name="pos958"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line959"><a name="pos959"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line960"><a name="pos960"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> They said they want a gun confiscated from a certain person on Thursday, they demanded that gun.   Comrade Sugar had this gun on his person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line961"><a name="pos961"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Did he give it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line962"><a name="pos962"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> He did not give them the gun.</p>
<p class="line" id="line963"><a name="pos963"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> What did they do when he did not give them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line964"><a name="pos964"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> They demanded the gun, and they pointed at me and Lefu (?) said, "You guys are very young, we don't know why do you associate with these people".   Mr Sugar asked them what they had in mind.   Vips replied by saying, "Wait, wait and see".</p>
<p class="line" id="line965"><a name="pos965"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line966"><a name="pos966"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> They then jumped into their car and they shot in the air.   It was a warning shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line967"><a name="pos967"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line968"><a name="pos968"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> And they drove off.   On Monday, the 6th, late, at about five o'clock, I was coming from work, a group of youths arrived at the rank, that was at the corner, they had containers with them and pipes.   They were taking petrol from every taxi that was passing by, they said, "Just a little will do".   I went to them, I also had my container, I also was joining in tapping the petrol.   They said, "Man, we don't need your assistance here".</p>
<p class="line" id="line969"><a name="pos969"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Why did you join them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line970"><a name="pos970"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> We were together, I was, I did not know that</p>
<p class="line" id="line971"><a name="pos971"></a>there was a conflict between us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line972"><a name="pos972"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line973"><a name="pos973"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> Well, I went back, I did not refuse.   I can't remember whether it was nine o'clock, we heard a whistle</p>
<p class="line" id="line974"><a name="pos974"></a>sound from F block, we then ran towards F direction, because we were members of the SDU.   When we arrived there, Bulelwa was already shot.   We guarded the corpse until about 12 o'clock at night, and we were told that those who were employed must go and sleep, have some rest.   I left with those who went to sleep.</p>
<p class="line" id="line975"><a name="pos975"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> And then the following day, is it the day that you have spent on all the capturing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line976"><a name="pos976"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> Yes, that was in the morning.   No, in the morning, I came back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line977"><a name="pos977"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Okay, now as a result of these killings, is there anything that you benefited personally from such action?</p>
<p class="line" id="line978"><a name="pos978"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> I did not benefit anything for myself, but, well maybe the community benefited, because many things, criminal activities, stopped.</p>
<p class="line" id="line979"><a name="pos979"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> I've no further questions, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line980"><a name="pos980"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY ADV MADASA</p>
<p class="line" id="line981"><a name="pos981"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MAPOMA:</span> You have outlined the activities where these young persons were implicated.   Now when you captured them, how did you determine that this one participated and this one did not participate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line982"><a name="pos982"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you confining yourself to the group that was captured by him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line983"><a name="pos983"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Yes, the group that was captured, chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line984"><a name="pos984"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Didn't he say they had been given names?   Were you not given names of persons who had taken part in the killing of Blanko and Bulelwa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line985"><a name="pos985"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> No.   I learnt later that a person who killed Bulelwa is Vips.</p>
<p class="line" id="line986"><a name="pos986"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Yes, but did you go out to capture people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line987"><a name="pos987"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line988"><a name="pos988"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> What about Mavuso?</p>
<p class="line" id="line989"><a name="pos989"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> Yes, the commander said, he instructed us to go and fetch Mavuso.</p>
<p class="line" id="line990"><a name="pos990"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> You said Mchebe gave you an AK47 and made an order that all of you are going to operate.   Did you all operate?</p>
<p class="line" id="line991"><a name="pos991"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> Yes, the one who did not operate is Vusi, others had axes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line992"><a name="pos992"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Did you have an axe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line993"><a name="pos993"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line994"><a name="pos994"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Now, when (Indistinct) Buthelezi, the older one, was brought in the shack, were you present then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line995"><a name="pos995"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> I was not there yet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line996"><a name="pos996"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Thank you, no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line997"><a name="pos997"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MAPOMA</p>
<p class="line" id="line998"><a name="pos998"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, Mr Sibanyoni, is there anything arising, Mr ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line999"><a name="pos999"></a><span class="speaker">MR MADASA:</span> No, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1000"><a name="pos1000"></a>NO RE-EXAMINATION BY MR MADASA</p>
<p class="line" id="line1001"><a name="pos1001"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, Mr Sibanyoni?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1002"><a name="pos1002"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairperson.   Mr Shongwe, after you collected Mavuso from his mother and you were walking along with him with the other guy interrogating them, did they volunteer the information, or were you to threaten them first or torture the information out of them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1003"><a name="pos1003"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> We did not torture Mavuso.   When we said Blanko is killed, after that he said, "Where are you taking me to?"  He kept quiet for a long time.   After asking that question, he tried to run away, that's one issue I forgot, he tried to run away, then we caught him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1004"><a name="pos1004"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> But you are saying they implicated themselves  voluntarily, freely?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1005"><a name="pos1005"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> I mean in the shacks, but on the road we did not torture him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1006"><a name="pos1006"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Now, despite the fact that these youths were doing all these things you mentioned, hijacking cars, looting tuckshops, killing people and threatening you that they will hit you slowly but surely, no drastic steps were taken against them.    Why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1007"><a name="pos1007"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> We did not take any drastic steps because this thing was spoken in the meeting, that we should bring so that we'll be able to negotiate until the hit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1008"><a name="pos1008"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Now, according to you, had they not killed Bulelwa and Blanko, would they have been killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1009"><a name="pos1009"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> No, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1010"><a name="pos1010"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> In other words, what sparked or what caused, or the reason for their killing was specifically the killing of Bulelwa and Blanko?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1011"><a name="pos1011"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> Yes, that is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1012"><a name="pos1012"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Do you agree with the statement that the relatives, in other words the relatives of the victims, their parents and other relatives, are also part of the community of Moleleki?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1013"><a name="pos1013"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> Yes, they are part of Moleleki community, some of them are not part of the Moleleki community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1014"><a name="pos1014"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Now if I'm saying to you, those parents and relatives did not benefit anything from the killing of these youth, what would be your reaction to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1015"><a name="pos1015"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> I don't dispute that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1016"><a name="pos1016"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Thank you, no further questions, Mr Chair-person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1017"><a name="pos1017"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Malan?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1018"><a name="pos1018"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Would you tell us, when this incident took place when you found them with the containers at the taxis collecting a litre petrol from each taxi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1019"><a name="pos1019"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> It was around five to six.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1020"><a name="pos1020"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> How long was this before the incident where they were killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1021"><a name="pos1021"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> It's a day before they were killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1022"><a name="pos1022"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> It was on the day of Bulelwa's death?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1023"><a name="pos1023"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1024"><a name="pos1024"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And you participated with them, you had your container, if I heard you correctly, and you also wanted to collect petrol?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1025"><a name="pos1025"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> Yes sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1026"><a name="pos1026"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Would that not be a criminal activity?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1027"><a name="pos1027"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> It would be a criminal activity, but there was nothing I could do, because if you sit on the fence, you'd be an informer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1028"><a name="pos1028"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did I not hear you correctly saying that they did not want you to help and that you then left?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1029"><a name="pos1029"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1030"><a name="pos1030"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And did I hear you correctly saying that you were not aware of any differences or difficulties with them at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1031"><a name="pos1031"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> The way I observed, I did not see, it started, that incident started to give me a new impression, when they said they don't want me there, then it shows that I was not wanted, so I should put myself aside from them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1032"><a name="pos1032"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But you were not aware of any conflict before then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1033"><a name="pos1033"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> I was not in conflict with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1034"><a name="pos1034"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> When did you become an operator?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1035"><a name="pos1035"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> I began to be an operator in 1992 in June, if I remember well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1036"><a name="pos1036"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Where was it, was it in Moleleki, in Moleleki section?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1037"><a name="pos1037"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1038"><a name="pos1038"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Were you then part of the Youth League?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1039"><a name="pos1039"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1040"><a name="pos1040"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> At that stage, Vips and the others who were killed were also part of the Youth League?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1041"><a name="pos1041"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> Yes, they were part of the ANC Youth League at the time when I was with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1042"><a name="pos1042"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> When did they separate themselves from the SDU?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1043"><a name="pos1043"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> They withdrew at the time when they knew SDU was just about to be formed in block F.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1044"><a name="pos1044"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Are you aware of the allegation, or the statement that they were, the Youth League was patrolling A to D, blocks A to D?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1045"><a name="pos1045"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> I don't know that, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1046"><a name="pos1046"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did you hear that evidence given by Mr Armoed?   Was it Armoed?   Ja.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1047"><a name="pos1047"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> Yes, I heard.   I would explain this way, that information was heard, but I knew that we were one thing with them, but on that day when I was chased out, I could verify that way I'm not working together with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1048"><a name="pos1048"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And yet the day before their death, you didn't know of any conflict.   Can you explain that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1049"><a name="pos1049"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> May you please repeat your question, sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1050"><a name="pos1050"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> The day before their death, you gave evidence that you were not aware of any conflict between the SDU and the Youth League people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1051"><a name="pos1051"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> That is correct, I did not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1052"><a name="pos1052"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Sorry, could you just repeat?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1053"><a name="pos1053"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> That is correct, I did not know that there is a conflict, but the day when I was chased to help them tap petrol from the taxis, I started to know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1054"><a name="pos1054"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And if I hear you correctly, that was the day before they were killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1055"><a name="pos1055"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> Yes, that is the day before they were killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1056"><a name="pos1056"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> When was this meeting in F block where they formed the new SDU?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1057"><a name="pos1057"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> I would tell a lie, I don't know, but I learnt from rumours.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1058"><a name="pos1058"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1059"><a name="pos1059"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, Mr Motata?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1060"><a name="pos1060"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman.   Mr Shongwe, just one question, when the SDU's were formed, it's because there were criminal activities against the community in Katlehong.  Am I understanding the picture correctly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1061"><a name="pos1061"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> The SDU's were formed against Inkatha and gangsterism, and the boers when they were coming to attack, because boers were our enemies.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1062"><a name="pos1062"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Now we have evidence that you had no working relationship with the police.    Is my understanding correct as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1063"><a name="pos1063"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1064"><a name="pos1064"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Now, prior to the 7th of December 1993, if you had captured somebody involved in these untoward actions, what would happen to that person, because you wouldn't take him to the police, for instance?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1065"><a name="pos1065"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> You mean in regard to the killing of Blanko and Bulelwa, what kind of incidents are you referring to, or activities?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1066"><a name="pos1066"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Because you were not co-operating with the police, say for instance you catch someone, you do not take that person to the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1067"><a name="pos1067"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1068"><a name="pos1068"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Now what would have happened to that person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1069"><a name="pos1069"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> We had a disciplinary procedure.   In many instances, if you kill, you will be killed, if you kill, you'll be killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1070"><a name="pos1070"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Thank you, Mr Chair, I've got no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1071"><a name="pos1071"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The persons that you were called upon to go and look for, did you consider these persons to be dangerous?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1072"><a name="pos1072"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> Which people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1073"><a name="pos1073"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The people that you were called upon go go and capture.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1074"><a name="pos1074"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> It was not clear that they were dangerous, because the commander just said to go and fetch the person, and at first one person, he did not give me a gun, he just said, "Go and fetch this kind of a person", then we went.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1075"><a name="pos1075"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> As I understand your evidence, the people that were killed were perceived as criminals, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1076"><a name="pos1076"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1077"><a name="pos1077"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you also perceive them as criminals?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1078"><a name="pos1078"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> Yes, I regarded them as criminals, because what they did, the community did not appreciate, they were harassing the community which we were living with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1079"><a name="pos1079"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But as far as you were concerned, you had no problem with them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1080"><a name="pos1080"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> I don't understand, sir, problem, what problem are you talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1081"><a name="pos1081"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, you told us that you wanted to take part in siphoning petrol from taxi motor vehicles.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1082"><a name="pos1082"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> Yes, I told you that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1083"><a name="pos1083"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And how long was this before the 7th of December?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1084"><a name="pos1084"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> It was on the 6th, late on that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1085"><a name="pos1085"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So, as late as the 6th of December 1993, you wanted to associate yourself with persons that you perceived to be criminals?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1086"><a name="pos1086"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> Yes, chairperson, if something was done, we would all take part, not even one would stand aside.   If you stood aside, you would be regarded as an informer, and the results thereof would be to be killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1087"><a name="pos1087"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If you had been present when they killed Bulelwa, would you have killed her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1088"><a name="pos1088"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> Because I would be part of them, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1089"><a name="pos1089"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you.   Is there anything arising, Mr Madasa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1090"><a name="pos1090"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Yes, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1091"><a name="pos1091"></a><span class="speaker">RE-EXAMINATION BY ADV MADASA:</span> When you say you did not have a problem with the ANC Youth League, what do you mean by that, what do you mean by problem?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1092"><a name="pos1092"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> I personally was not in conflict with them, that is what I meant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1093"><a name="pos1093"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> But the SDU to which you belonged, did they have a problem with them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1094"><a name="pos1094"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> I would say the SDU had problems with them, because it tried to call them to a meeting for a long time to resolve the issues, but they refused until the incident happened, the incident that we are gathered here for.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1095"><a name="pos1095"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Were you permitted by SDU to associate yourself with the activities of the ANC Youth League?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1096"><a name="pos1096"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> Because I was a member of the ANC Youth League, they were reprimanding me, saying, "Man, aren't you aware of their acts, one day we will catch you with them and then you're going to be assaulted together with them", and then I tried to withdraw myself from many criminal activities, most of the time I would be with these other men, because they were not involved in criminal acts, they did not want any criminal act.   You get into a person's house, you come out with a glass, just an ordinary glass, it was a big mistake to them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1097"><a name="pos1097"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> So you, you belonged to both organisations, the ANC Youth League and the SDU at the same time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1098"><a name="pos1098"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> We were one thing, we were one thing, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1099"><a name="pos1099"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> After that (indistinct), did you remain as a Youth League member?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1100"><a name="pos1100"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> I remained behind with the SDU.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1101"><a name="pos1101"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> After they had separated themselves with the SDU, would you have participated in their activities?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1102"><a name="pos1102"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> If I was part of them, yes I would take part if I was part of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1103"><a name="pos1103"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> I say after the ANC Youth League had separated itself from the SDU, you say you remained with the SDU, is that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1104"><a name="pos1104"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1105"><a name="pos1105"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Now I'm asking you, would you have participated in the activities of the Youth League?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1106"><a name="pos1106"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But he indeed attempted ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1107"><a name="pos1107"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> I would not take part, sir, because what they did was evident enough that they were harassing the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1108"><a name="pos1108"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Why did you associate yourself with them and remain with the SDU?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1109"><a name="pos1109"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> I realised that their actions were not acceptable.   Now at times the boers were chasing after them, and I didn't like that.   During the shootout, one would be in a position to be shot at.   Now I withdrew from them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1110"><a name="pos1110"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1111"><a name="pos1111"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY ADV MADASA</p>
<p class="line" id="line1112"><a name="pos1112"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mapoma?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1113"><a name="pos1113"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Thanks, chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1114"><a name="pos1114"></a><span class="speaker">FURTHER CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MAPOMA:</span> I take it that there was a branch executive of the ANC Youth League at Moleleki, is that not correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1115"><a name="pos1115"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> Yes, there was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1116"><a name="pos1116"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Did you ever report these activities to the executive of the ANC Youth League in Moleleki?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1117"><a name="pos1117"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> Which activities?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1118"><a name="pos1118"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> The activities, these activities which are the criminal activities of the people whom you said were ANC Youth League, did you report those activities to the leadership of the ANC Youth League in Moleleki, you as a member of the ANC Youth League?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1119"><a name="pos1119"></a><span class="speaker">MR SHONGWE:</span> No sir, I did not report, you know, and it was during that time of killing, they would ask and inquire who reported, and then if it was discovered that I did, I would have been killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1120"><a name="pos1120"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Thank you, no further questions.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1155"><a name="pos1155"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINGO:</span> May you please repeat your question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1156"><a name="pos1156"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> At what stage did you join the other members of the SDU to take those people to there for killing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1157"><a name="pos1157"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINGO:</span> I joined them in the morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1158"><a name="pos1158"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> The day the victims were killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1159"><a name="pos1159"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINGO:</span> That is correct, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1160"><a name="pos1160"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> On that particular morning, where did you go, where were they when you joined them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1161"><a name="pos1161"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINGO:</span> It was like this, in the morning when I wake up going to work, I passed through Blanko's place, then I found people assembled there, I found that Blanko's shack has been burned, many people were crowding the area.   When I entered in, I found Blanko sitting on the chair, burnt to death.   That is where I joined.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1162"><a name="pos1162"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Now did you subsequently joined the group of the SDU members who were removing the victims to the open field?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1163"><a name="pos1163"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINGO:</span> From there, I learnt that there is another person who has been killed.   When I arrived at block F, I found that it was Bulelwa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1164"><a name="pos1164"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Did you join the people who were guarding the victims who were put in the shack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1165"><a name="pos1165"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINGO:</span> Yes, I was one of them, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1166"><a name="pos1166"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Were you invited to join?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1167"><a name="pos1167"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINGO:</span> I was standing next to the door of that shack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1168"><a name="pos1168"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> What did you do personally to those people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1169"><a name="pos1169"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINGO:</span> There's nothing I did, I was standing there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1170"><a name="pos1170"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Were you armed?   Sorry, I didn't hear, were you armed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1171"><a name="pos1171"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINGO:</span> I had a sjambok.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1172"><a name="pos1172"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> When those people were removed from the shack to the field, were you still there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1173"><a name="pos1173"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINGO:</span> Yes sir, I was still present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1174"><a name="pos1174"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> What did you do, did you go with the people who were taking them to the open field?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1175"><a name="pos1175"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINGO:</span> Yes sir, I accompanied that group.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1176"><a name="pos1176"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> How did you accompany them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1177"><a name="pos1177"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINGO:</span> When we took them there, some of them I beat them with that sjambok.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1178"><a name="pos1178"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Were you escorting these people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1179"><a name="pos1179"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINGO:</span> Yes sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1180"><a name="pos1180"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Were you told to do so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1181"><a name="pos1181"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINGO:</span> Do you mean in which way we were told, in which way and what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1182"><a name="pos1182"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Did anybody give you a command to escort those people to the open field?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1183"><a name="pos1183"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINGO:</span> As we were there, we were given an instruction that we should go with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1184"><a name="pos1184"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Who gave the instruction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1185"><a name="pos1185"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINGO:</span> That's Commander Mchebe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1186"><a name="pos1186"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Did he tell you what you were going to do with them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1187"><a name="pos1187"></a>...(TAPE ENDS)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1188"><a name="pos1188"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> At the spot where they were killed, did you do anything to them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1189"><a name="pos1189"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINGO:</span> When we arrived in the veld, they were instructed to sit down.   They were tied with rope.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1190"><a name="pos1190"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Did you kill any one of them, you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1191"><a name="pos1191"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINGO:</span> No sir, no-one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1192"><a name="pos1192"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Were you present when they were killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1193"><a name="pos1193"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINGO:</span> Yes, Your Honour, I was present when they were killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1194"><a name="pos1194"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Why did you not kill?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1195"><a name="pos1195"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINGO:</span> I played a role because I was present when they were killed, but in the actual killing, I did not take part.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1196"><a name="pos1196"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Did you hear the order by Dondola that they should be killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1197"><a name="pos1197"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINGO:</span> I heard when he said they should be killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1198"><a name="pos1198"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> So why did you not comply with your order?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1199"><a name="pos1199"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINGO:</span> I associated myself with the order, because if I did not associate myself with that order, I could have left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1200"><a name="pos1200"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Now why did you associate yourself with the killing of these people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1201"><a name="pos1201"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINGO:</span> I associated myself with the killing because of what they did, yes because of what they did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1202"><a name="pos1202"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Did you know which political organisation they belonged, or organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1203"><a name="pos1203"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just before you reply, you say you associated yourself with the killing because of what they did?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1204"><a name="pos1204"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINGO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1205"><a name="pos1205"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And I take it you're referring to the deceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1206"><a name="pos1206"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINGO:</span> To what they did to Bulelwa and Blanko, because I learnt that they are responsible for the killing of Blanko and Bulelwa.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1207"><a name="pos1207"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You associated yourself with their killing because they had killed Bulelwa and Blanko?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1208"><a name="pos1208"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINGO:</span> That is correct, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1209"><a name="pos1209"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1210"><a name="pos1210"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Did you know to which organisation they belonged, that is the victims?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1211"><a name="pos1211"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINGO:</span> I learnt that they were members of the ANC Youth League, who killed Bulelwa and Blanko.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1212"><a name="pos1212"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> What was your political objective in killing them, in participating in their killing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1213"><a name="pos1213"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINGO:</span> In other words I do not understand to explain what, as to whether my role in politics.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1214"><a name="pos1214"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sir, can you repeat your question, I don't understand what you mean by the political objective?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1215"><a name="pos1215"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> What did you want to achieve by complying with Dondola's order, what did you want to achieve?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1216"><a name="pos1216"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINGO:</span> I expected nothing, sir, when I carried out Dondola's order.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1217"><a name="pos1217"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Why did you comply with his order?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1218"><a name="pos1218"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINGO:</span> I complied to his order because he was a commander, he said these people have killed, they must be killed too.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1219"><a name="pos1219"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Did you know any of those people, the victims?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1220"><a name="pos1220"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINGO:</span> I did not know those people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1221"><a name="pos1221"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Do you know why they were killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1222"><a name="pos1222"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINGO:</span> Yes, as I have already said, that they were killed because they killed Bulelwa and Blanko.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1223"><a name="pos1223"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Is there anything that you benefited from killing them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1224"><a name="pos1224"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINGO:</span> No sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1225"><a name="pos1225"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> What was, in your understanding, what was the role of the SDU towards the community of Moleleki?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1226"><a name="pos1226"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINGO:</span> It was supposed to protect the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1227"><a name="pos1227"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Was that killing part of that duty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1228"><a name="pos1228"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINGO:</span> As they killed, I knew that they would continue killing.   As they killed Blanko, they would continue to kill each and every member of SDU, as they pledged to do so, that's the information I received.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1229"><a name="pos1229"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Did you believe that therefore that killing was part of the duty of the SDU to protect the community?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1230"><a name="pos1230"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINGO:</span> Yes, I understood it that way, that that killing was to protect myself and to protect the community, as I've explained that when they were interrogated, they said they were instructed to kill every member of the SDU's, they were following a list.   As Blanko was the chairperson of SDU.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1231"><a name="pos1231"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Bulelwa was not a member of the SDU, was she?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1232"><a name="pos1232"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINGO:</span> Bulelwa was not a member of the SDU.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1233"><a name="pos1233"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And from your understanding, they wanted to kill the members of the SDU?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1234"><a name="pos1234"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINGO:</span> Yes, it was like that, that they were going to kill all members of the SDU's, as they were following a list, as instructed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1235"><a name="pos1235"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.   Are you aware of the rumour that Bulelwa was killed by the SDU?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1236"><a name="pos1236"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINGO:</span> I did not hear that rumour that Bulelwa was killed by SDU, I know that, I heard that Bulelwa was killed by the youth, together with Blanko as they were killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1237"><a name="pos1237"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Do you know why the Youth League would have wanted to kill Bulelwa if she's not a member of the SDU and if they had a list of SDU members that they wanted to kill?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1238"><a name="pos1238"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINGO:</span> I would not know, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1239"><a name="pos1239"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1240"><a name="pos1240"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Now, let's assume that the SDU members were indeed killed by these youths as they threatened.   Now, my</p>
<p class="line" id="line1241"><a name="pos1241"></a>question is, would that act have left the community unprotected?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1242"><a name="pos1242"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINGO:</span> Yes, Your Honour, because as we were protecting the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1243"><a name="pos1243"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> I have no further questions, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1244"><a name="pos1244"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY ADV MADASA</p>
<p class="line" id="line1245"><a name="pos1245"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MAPOMA:</span> You say Mchebe instructed that they be taken to the veld and did not explain what to be done about them in the veld, is that what you said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1246"><a name="pos1246"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINGO:</span> He said they should be killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1247"><a name="pos1247"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> So when you were sjambokking them on the way to the veld, you were aware that they were going to be killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1248"><a name="pos1248"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINGO:</span> At that time when I was sjambokking them, I was not aware that they were going to be killed, I thought they were going to be beaten, but he said they should be killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1249"><a name="pos1249"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> When exactly did he say they should be killed, at the veld or when you were on the way to the veld?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1250"><a name="pos1250"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINGO:</span> When we were at the shack, when they were locked in the shack, but I didn't hear that, when we left I didn't hear that instruction that they were going to be killed, I only learnt that from the scene.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1251"><a name="pos1251"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Did he repeat the instructions on the scene, that they must be killed now, is that what you're saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1252"><a name="pos1252"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINGO:</span> When we arrived at the veld, he shot, then operators who were armed followed with the shooting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1253"><a name="pos1253"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Now did you get any instruction from Mchebe to kill them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1254"><a name="pos1254"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I thought Mchebe issued an order that these people must be killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1255"><a name="pos1255"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Yes, chairperson, I want to find out from him if he did get the instruction, because he says in his evidence that he was not aware that Mchebe said they must be killed, that's what I want ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1256"><a name="pos1256"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> At what stage, at what stage, I mean is it an issue that Mchebe issued an order that these individuals be killed, because the evidence we've heard so far is that Mchebe issued an order that these people must be killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1257"><a name="pos1257"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Thank you, chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1258"><a name="pos1258"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is it an issue?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1259"><a name="pos1259"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> I thought, chairperson, it is an issue insofar as he is concerned, because he himself did not get an instruction to kill.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1260"><a name="pos1260"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.   Ask him then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1261"><a name="pos1261"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Did you, as a person, get instructions from Mchebe to kill?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1262"><a name="pos1262"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINGO:</span> He gave me an order, because we were many, I saw people going out and they were saying, "Mchebe said these people should be killed".   He gave me that order even if I did not hear that order, but he was instructing each and every member of the SDU.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1263"><a name="pos1263"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> So you did not kill anyone, even though you heard the instruction to kill?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1264"><a name="pos1264"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINGO:</span> No sir, I did not kill a person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1265"><a name="pos1265"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Thank you, no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1266"><a name="pos1266"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MAPOMA</p>
<p class="line" id="line1267"><a name="pos1267"></a>NO RE-EXAMINATION BY ADV MADASA</p>
<p class="line" id="line1268"><a name="pos1268"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Sibanyoni?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1269"><a name="pos1269"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairperson.   Mr Singo, where did you get the sjambok from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1270"><a name="pos1270"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINGO:</span> I don't know from whom I took it from, because I was the person who was going to work, I joined them at Blanko's place, I took it from a certain person, because many people were having different kinds of, assortments of arms, so I took, I took that sjambok from somebody.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1271"><a name="pos1271"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Were you specifically instructed to beat, to hit these youth, or you only used your discretion as to what contribution you should make?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1272"><a name="pos1272"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINGO:</span> I hit somebody when he was brought, even if I don't know his name, that they were responsible for Blanko's murder.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1273"><a name="pos1273"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Now, during the actual killing at the veld, is there anything whatsoever which you did?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1274"><a name="pos1274"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINGO:</span> During the killing, I did not do anything, as I've already explained that I had only a sjambok.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1275"><a name="pos1275"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> When they were tied, did you take any part in tying them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1276"><a name="pos1276"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINGO:</span> No sir, I did not take part.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1277"><a name="pos1277"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> How were they tied, were they tied all of them together or in certain groups?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1278"><a name="pos1278"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINGO:</span> They were tied with one rope.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1279"><a name="pos1279"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> These youths allegedly, or they were suspected of having killed some people at night, and specifically they were suspected of having killed Majosi, yet they were never killed at that stage, it's only when they killed Blanko and Bulelwa that they were killed, and to me it appears as if it was either retaliation or revenge on the part of the SDU who were now saying they've killed another member of the SDU and Bulelwa, who was supportive of the SDU.   What would be your reaction to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1280"><a name="pos1280"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINGO:</span> During the death of Mr Majosi, I know nothing because I was staying at Khumalo Section, I came later, then I learned from rumours that Mr Majosi was killed by, was killed together with his two cousins.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1281"><a name="pos1281"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> The crux of my question is, had these youths continued to hijack, to loot and kill other people and not members of the SDU, they would not be killed.   What is your response to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1282"><a name="pos1282"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINGO:</span> With my own observation, I would say that they were killed because they killed Comrade Blanko and Comrade Bulelwa, as they continued killing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1283"><a name="pos1283"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> When there were hijackings, lootings, were members of the community able to say the perpetrators are members of the ANC Youth League, or were they just saying the perpetrators were members of the SDU, could the community make any distinction between ANC Youth League members and SDU members?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1284"><a name="pos1284"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINGO:</span> The committee knew.   I remember one day when the meeting was called to talk about the lootings and the hijackings, things like that, it was found out that where we met there was a car which has been left in a ditch, and the other issues that in the meeting a certain van came with a group of youth driven by Vips.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1285"><a name="pos1285"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Now what was the allegation from the community?   Was the allegation that the people who are causing trouble are members of the ANC Youth League or are members of the SDU?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1286"><a name="pos1286"></a><span class="speaker">MR SINGO:</span> The community tried to reprimand them as they were there in the meeting, that people should disassociate themselves with criminality, they knew that it was the Youth League.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1287"><a name="pos1287"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairperson, no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1288"><a name="pos1288"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Malan?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1373"><a name="pos1373"></a><span class="speaker">MR MASHININI:</span> The community would be protected because they would no longer be there.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1442"><a name="pos1442"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> Myself, Shongwe, we went to fetch Mavuso from home with Themba.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1443"><a name="pos1443"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Did you find Mavuso?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1444"><a name="pos1444"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> Yes, we found him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1445"><a name="pos1445"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> What did you do with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1446"><a name="pos1446"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> We found his mother at home, his mother, his father and his sister.   We requested permission to go, to leave with Mavuso, we said the commander, Mchebe Dondolo, wanted to see him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1447"><a name="pos1447"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1448"><a name="pos1448"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> I am the person who was holding him and the others were coming behind, we took him to that shack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1449"><a name="pos1449"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1450"><a name="pos1450"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> We put him inside the shack and then I came down to wait there.   That will be all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1451"><a name="pos1451"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Did you go to the place where they were killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1452"><a name="pos1452"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> Yes, I did go to the place where they were killed, I was there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1453"><a name="pos1453"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Tell us about your involvement in that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1454"><a name="pos1454"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> Before we go to the veld, Lepele Shia, one of our comrades, he came with a rope and then he gave it to us, so that we tied them up.   We did just that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1455"><a name="pos1455"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1456"><a name="pos1456"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> After tying them up, I then went outside to sit.   Then Comrade Shia was also outside leaning against the pole.   We were then told that a commander issued out an order that they be killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1457"><a name="pos1457"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Who told you that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1458"><a name="pos1458"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> I heard from Lepele Shia, he did not go down with us, he was left behind, because I also left after quite some time of their departure, it might have been a distance from here to that door.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1459"><a name="pos1459"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Did Shia tell you where the order came from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1460"><a name="pos1460"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> He told me that the commander issued out an order.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1461"><a name="pos1461"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Oh.  Did he tell you who that commander was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1462"><a name="pos1462"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> Yes, he told me, Mchebe Dondolo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1463"><a name="pos1463"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Did you then escort the people to the open field?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1464"><a name="pos1464"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> Sir, I already told you that I was not close to them, I was far behind them and they were walking ahead of me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1465"><a name="pos1465"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> So you followed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1466"><a name="pos1466"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> Yes, I followed.   I followed them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1467"><a name="pos1467"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Yes, continue, you followed them, then what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1468"><a name="pos1468"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> I saw Comrade Mchebe shooting, and thereafter AK47 rifles were also used.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1469"><a name="pos1469"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Were you armed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1470"><a name="pos1470"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1471"><a name="pos1471"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> With what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1472"><a name="pos1472"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> I had a spear.   Because I usually had a knobkierie, I don't remember where did I get hold of this spear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1473"><a name="pos1473"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Did you kill anybody?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1474"><a name="pos1474"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> Yes, chair, after they were shot with guns, Comrade Mchebe said, "Lefu, Mavuso is not dead, stab him", and then I executed that order, I just stabbed him once.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1475"><a name="pos1475"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Did he die?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1476"><a name="pos1476"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> He was already shot when I stabbed him, I stabbed him just once and then I pulled out the spear and then I left.   I don't know whether it was my stabbing or the bullets that he had already received that killed him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1477"><a name="pos1477"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Is there any other person that you attached at the scene?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1478"><a name="pos1478"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> No sir, nobody else, because I was so scared, I stabbed quickly because I was so afraid, and then I immediately left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1479"><a name="pos1479"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> These people who you killed, do you know them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1480"><a name="pos1480"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> I've already said that I did not even know Motsi, I knew them thereafter, and then I happened to know Mavuso, but the rest I did not know, and I only knew, I knew Vips, who was taken and killed in Khumalo.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1481"><a name="pos1481"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Were you told to which organisation those people belonged?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1482"><a name="pos1482"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> Yes, I was told.   When I arrived in 1992, in September, when I arrived in Moleleki, the SDU was working with the SDU, they were together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1483"><a name="pos1483"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> No, we know that history, but what I'm asking is, the victims, did you know if they were members of the ANC Youth League?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1484"><a name="pos1484"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> Yes, I knew, but not all of them, some of them were members of the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1485"><a name="pos1485"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Sorry, can you come again, some of them were members of what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1486"><a name="pos1486"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> ANC Youth League, and some of them were members of the PAC, they were mixing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1487"><a name="pos1487"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Do you know why they were killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1488"><a name="pos1488"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1489"><a name="pos1489"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1490"><a name="pos1490"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> It's because of the deceased No 1's death, I think it's (indistinct) Bulelwa, and Mr Comrade Blanko.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1491"><a name="pos1491"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> To your knowledge, is there any other reason why they were killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1492"><a name="pos1492"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> Members of the ANC Youth League you are referring to, sir, which members are you referring to now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1493"><a name="pos1493"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> The whole (indistinct).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1494"><a name="pos1494"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> Yes sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1495"><a name="pos1495"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1496"><a name="pos1496"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> There were side talks from them when they were reprimanded about their lootings in the spaza shops.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1497"><a name="pos1497"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> So were they also killed for their criminal involvements, is that what you're saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1498"><a name="pos1498"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> That is not a big reason, they took that step because they were reprimanded, members of the Self Defence Unit reprimanded them, warned them, now what they did in turn was to kill Mr Blanko and Bulelwa, because they were being reprimanded of the activities in the township.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1499"><a name="pos1499"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, but I think what you are being asked is whether, are you aware of any other reason why they were killed, apart from the fact that they killed Bulelwa and Blanko?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1500"><a name="pos1500"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> I only know of that reason, sir, I don't have any other.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1501"><a name="pos1501"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> All right, listen, was their killing connected with the SDU protecting the community?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1502"><a name="pos1502"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> Yes sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1503"><a name="pos1503"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Was it connected?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1504"><a name="pos1504"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> The SDU protected the community and the situation was violent during that time, IFP and other organisations were attacking.   At times the Stability was attacking, coming to take people by force from the township, because when they entered the township they entered with gun shooting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1505"><a name="pos1505"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> So how was the killing of those people a protective measure for the community?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1506"><a name="pos1506"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> The killing of the members of the Youth League?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1507"><a name="pos1507"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1508"><a name="pos1508"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> It would protect the community because the community was complaining, they complained about the hijackings, the spaza shops were broken in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1509"><a name="pos1509"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Did you benefit anything from the killings, personally?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1510"><a name="pos1510"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> I did not benefit anything, sir, I was only protecting the community.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1511"><a name="pos1511"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> No further questions, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1512"><a name="pos1512"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY ADV MADASA</p>
<p class="line" id="line1513"><a name="pos1513"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MAPOMA:</span> Amongst the people who were killed on the 7th of December 1993, whom did you know to be a member of the PAC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1514"><a name="pos1514"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> I did not know all of them, sir.   The slogans, or rather the clothing that they put on was written PAC/ANC, and they were together during their rallies at Hunters Field.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1515"><a name="pos1515"></a><span class="speaker">MR MAPOMA:</span> Whom did you see wearing a T shirt belonging to the PAC amongst those who were killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1516"><a name="pos1516"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> I did not specifically look, because I was part of them when we go to the rallies, I cannot tell their by names.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1520"><a name="pos1520"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, Mr Malan?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1521"><a name="pos1521"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> In your evidence, Mr Mokoena, you said that when you went to round up, who was the person, Mavuso, you asked permission from his mother and sister and you said that the commander wanted to see them.   Did they say anything?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1522"><a name="pos1522"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> I was listening with my two ears, sir, they asked, "Where are you taking him to?", and their reply was, "Comrade Dondolo Mchebe wants him, he wants to know something from him".</p>
<p class="line" id="line1523"><a name="pos1523"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did they ask you what it was about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1524"><a name="pos1524"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> Can you repeat yourself, Chairperson?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1525"><a name="pos1525"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did they not want to know why Comrade Dondolo wanted to see them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1526"><a name="pos1526"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> They wanted to know, sir, but we replied by saying he wants to ask them questions, but we didn't tell them the nature of the questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1527"><a name="pos1527"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did they ask about the nature of the questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1528"><a name="pos1528"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> They asked me, sir, and I told them that I do not know what kind of a question he's going to ask him, because we were only ordered to fetch him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1529"><a name="pos1529"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did he, at that stage, ask any questions, this is Mavuso now?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1530"><a name="pos1530"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> On our way he was talking to Themba and Shongwe, I only held him, he was talking to them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1531"><a name="pos1531"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did he want to know why you were taking him, did you hear what all the talking was about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1532"><a name="pos1532"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> They were facing each other and I did not hear what they said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1533"><a name="pos1533"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> No further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1534"><a name="pos1534"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Motata?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1535"><a name="pos1535"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Thank you, chairperson.   Mr Mokoena, you said sometimes you used to attend the rallies with them at Hunters Field.   Did I hear you correctly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1536"><a name="pos1536"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> You heard perfectly well, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1537"><a name="pos1537"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Now when you attended these rallies, under which umbrella were you attending, SDU, ANC Youth League or PAC, under which umbrella were you attending?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1538"><a name="pos1538"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> I cannot tell specifically in which year did we go to the rally, but I think Mandela was present at that rally.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1539"><a name="pos1539"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Did you belong to the ANC Youth League?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1540"><a name="pos1540"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> I did not catch your question, sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1541"><a name="pos1541"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> I say you personally, did you belong to the ANC Youth League?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1542"><a name="pos1542"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> No, I was a member of the Self Defence Unit.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1546"><a name="pos1546"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Mokoena, you may return to your seat.   Yes, Mr Madasa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1547"><a name="pos1547"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> Chairperson, before I go back to my seat, I want to ask for forgiveness from the parents of those who I killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1548"><a name="pos1548"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, do you know their parents?   Yes, you say you want forgiveness from the parents of the persons?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1549"><a name="pos1549"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> I'm saying the parent to Mavuso and the parents of (Indistinct) Motsi, I really ask for their forgiveness, but I did not take part in the assault of Motsi.   I'm asking for forgiveness from Mrs Mavuso.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1550"><a name="pos1550"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think after this you may have the opportunity to go and speak to Mrs Mavuso if she's here.  Is there anything further you want to say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1551"><a name="pos1551"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> Sir, I'm not only speaking on my behalf, I'm speaking on behalf of all the members of the Self Defence Unit, all the mothers who are gathered here today, please forgive us, I'm not saying forgive me, forgive us all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1552"><a name="pos1552"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We understand that you are asking for forgiveness.   Are you doing so because you recognise that what you did was wrong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1553"><a name="pos1553"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> That is correct, My Lord, I'm asking for forgiveness because I realised that what I did was wrong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1554"><a name="pos1554"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Mr Mokoena, you said you are not only asking for forgiveness for yourself only, but for your co-applicants and co-members of the SDU, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1555"><a name="pos1555"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> Chairperson, I have already said I am not only asking for forgiveness for myself, as the SDU's we ask forgiveness for what we did.   We had reasons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1556"><a name="pos1556"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Now as you are seated there, Mr Mokoena, do you have mandate from your comrades that you should speak on their behalf and ask for forgiveness from families of the victims?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1557"><a name="pos1557"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> They did not mandate me, I am doing it out of my person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1558"><a name="pos1558"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Have you, as members of the SDU, either before this week or during the course of this week, discussed this and shown, or any member shown remorse of the wrong deeds you perpetrated?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1559"><a name="pos1559"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> That is correct, My Lord.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1560"><a name="pos1560"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> And would we be understanding you to say, whilst you ask for forgiveness on behalf of everybody, your deductions are that whilst discussing this, other members of the SDU showed remorse?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1561"><a name="pos1561"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> Yes, because we are here, sir, to ask for forgiveness, to ask for amnesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1562"><a name="pos1562"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> As we are seated here, we are not aware of the individual members of the families, but we do have a list of the next of kin, when you say they must forgive you, are you saying you want to approach them before you take your seat, to ask for that forgiveness, or are you merely saying it from where you are seated, that you ask for forgiveness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1563"><a name="pos1563"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> I would like to go to them, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1564"><a name="pos1564"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, the committee will take note of the statement that you have made and the forgiveness that you have asked for.   I would suggest that after the committee has risen this afternoon, you approach your counsel and discuss the matter with him.   Do you understand that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1565"><a name="pos1565"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOKOENA:</span> Yes sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1566"><a name="pos1566"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.   Thank you, sir.   Is there anything arising?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1567"><a name="pos1567"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> No, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1568"><a name="pos1568"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you, Mr Mokoena, you may return to your seat.   Yes, Mr Madasa?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1580"><a name="pos1580"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Right, in the SDU were you an operator or an ordinary patrol?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1581"><a name="pos1581"></a><span class="speaker">MR LUPHINDO:</span> I used to patrol.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1582"><a name="pos1582"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Did you capture any people in connection with the killings of December 1993?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1583"><a name="pos1583"></a><span class="speaker">MR LUPHINDO:</span> No, I did not capture anyone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1584"><a name="pos1584"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Were you present when the victims were put in the shack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1585"><a name="pos1585"></a><span class="speaker">MR LUPHINDO:</span> I was absent.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1586"><a name="pos1586"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Did you go to Blanko's place when it was burning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1587"><a name="pos1587"></a><span class="speaker">MR LUPHINDO:</span> Yes, there was a whistle that was blown, I got up and went there, there were a whole lot of comrades trying to put out the fire.   I also started helping.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1588"><a name="pos1588"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> After the fire was extinguished, when the other comrades look for Blanko's assailants, did you go with any group to look for them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1589"><a name="pos1589"></a><span class="speaker">MR LUPHINDO:</span> I was left behind where the deceased was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1590"><a name="pos1590"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> From Blanko's place, did you go anywhere?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1591"><a name="pos1591"></a><span class="speaker">MR LUPHINDO:</span> No, I never left, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1592"><a name="pos1592"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> You remained at Blanko's place until when?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1593"><a name="pos1593"></a><span class="speaker">MR LUPHINDO:</span> We stayed there with other people until morning.   The Internal Stability Unit came and fetched the body.   After they had taken the body, we heard that some people had been captured and were in a shack.   I then also left with the others to check those comrades that were found.   I found them there, tied up in a rope together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1594"><a name="pos1594"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Where were they at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1595"><a name="pos1595"></a><span class="speaker">MR LUPHINDO:</span> They were in a shack, at Block F.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1596"><a name="pos1596"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> And from that shack, where did you go?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1597"><a name="pos1597"></a><span class="speaker">MR LUPHINDO:</span> We were waiting for a decision that was to be taken by a commander who had gone to Zone 5, Khumaville(?).  When the commander came back, Mchebe Dondolo, he gave us an order that Comrade Bulelwa was killed by Vips and Tusanang, therefore they must also go into the forest to be killed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1598"><a name="pos1598"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Did Dondolo mention Blanko?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1599"><a name="pos1599"></a><span class="speaker">MR LUPHINDO:</span> Please repeat your question, sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1600"><a name="pos1600"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Did Dondola mention Blanko?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1601"><a name="pos1601"></a><span class="speaker">MR LUPHINDO:</span> He spoke of the late Bulelwa and Blanko.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1602"><a name="pos1602"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Thank you, Mr Chair.   Did you carry out the order?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1603"><a name="pos1603"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What happened after that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1604"><a name="pos1604"></a><span class="speaker">MR LUPHINDO:</span> After the order had been given out, they were escorted, yes I was present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1605"><a name="pos1605"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1606"><a name="pos1606"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Wait, there's no interpretation, is there ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1607"><a name="pos1607"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Would you just hold it, Mr Luphindo, we're just clearing up something please, just hold on for a second.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1608"><a name="pos1608"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The witness may proceed, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1609"><a name="pos1609"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Yes.   Mr Luphindo, would you go back again to the stage when you say you were part of the persons who escorted them to the field, all right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1610"><a name="pos1610"></a><span class="speaker">MR LUPHINDO:</span> The order had already been given out from Comrade Mchebe Dondolo that they should be taken to the forest.   I also had a stick, I was pushing them from behind, I used the stick.   When we got to the forest, Commander Mchebe Dondolo said that they must sit down.  He's the one who was carrying a shot nine(?) rifle, he shot four times.   The other comrades had AK47's.   He said that they must continue and finish the job up, they must be killed, he said, because they had also killed.   They were shot.   After they were shot, some of them were still moving a bit.  The commander, Mchebe Dondolo, gave out yet another order, saying that some of them are still moving, alive.   Those that were carrying axes and spears, they were ordered to finish off the job.   The role that I played was to hit one of them on the head with a stick that I was carrying, after they had been shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1611"><a name="pos1611"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1612"><a name="pos1612"></a><span class="speaker">MR LUPHINDO:</span> After we finished the job that we were ordered by our commander, we left, we went back to the township.   When we got to block F, Commander Dondolo and Comrade Mgetse, they went to Mr Buthelezi's house.   We heard two gunshots, we were left behind standing outside when we heard these shots.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1613"><a name="pos1613"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1614"><a name="pos1614"></a><span class="speaker">MR LUPHINDO:</span> After that, from block F, we went to block C.  When we got to block C, we came across a young boy called Mtebeleng.   We took him, he was actually taken by the commander.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1615"><a name="pos1615"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1616"><a name="pos1616"></a><span class="speaker">MR LUPHINDO:</span> We went looking for the shack where he stayed, or where the young men stayed.   We did not find them.   We then turned, or turned back to our own places.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1617"><a name="pos1617"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Why did you participate in the killing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1618"><a name="pos1618"></a><span class="speaker">MR LUPHINDO:</span> I was given an order by my commander.   There is nothing else I could do, I had to obey the order.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1620"><a name="pos1620"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I thought he said they'd killed Bulelwa and Blanko.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1621"><a name="pos1621"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Thank you, Mr Chair.   Was their killing connected with the duty of the SDU to protect the community?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1639"><a name="pos1639"></a><span class="speaker">MR LUPHINDO:</span> Mr Chairperson, I had recently arrived in that area, I did not just hit one person in the head, there was a few of them lying on the ground.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1640"><a name="pos1640"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> We understand that you were executing an order from a commander.   Now looking back to what happened, do you regret the deeds?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1665"><a name="pos1665"></a><span class="speaker">MR AUGUST:</span> I arrived in Moleleki in May 1993.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1666"><a name="pos1666"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> And where did you move from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1667"><a name="pos1667"></a><span class="speaker">MR AUGUST:</span> I was from Khumalo section.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1668"><a name="pos1668"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Where did you stay?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1669"><a name="pos1669"></a><span class="speaker">MR AUGUST:</span> I left Khumalo where I was residing, went across to Moleleki, Extension 2.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1670"><a name="pos1670"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Where did you stay in Moleleki?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1671"><a name="pos1671"></a><span class="speaker">MR AUGUST:</span> Oh, sorry, I resided in block F.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1672"><a name="pos1672"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Extension 2?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1673"><a name="pos1673"></a><span class="speaker">MR AUGUST:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1674"><a name="pos1674"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Were you working at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1675"><a name="pos1675"></a><span class="speaker">MR AUGUST:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1676"><a name="pos1676"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> In the SDU, were you an ordinary patroller, or an operator?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1677"><a name="pos1677"></a><span class="speaker">MR AUGUST:</span> I was a patroller.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1678"><a name="pos1678"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> During the capturing and killing of the victims, did you participate in the rounding up of them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1679"><a name="pos1679"></a><span class="speaker">MR AUGUST:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1680"><a name="pos1680"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Tell us, how did it come about that you went to round them up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1681"><a name="pos1681"></a><span class="speaker">MR AUGUST:</span> First of all, as there was this corpse, Bulelwa's corpse that we were watching over, it so happened that there were gunshots and there was this shack, Blanko's shack, that was set alight.   Yes, we were watching over Bulelwa's body.  They started firing shots and we tried to rush to the scene to see what was happening and when we arrived there, Blanko's shack was on fire and Blanko himself had been burnt inside.   We then stayed on watching over the fire until such time that the fire was extinguished.   After that, then that is Sugar, his nickname is Vembe, he is the one who discussed with Mchebe, saying that now that these people who created the problem have been seen, they are known, Oscar saw them, these people should therefore be rounded up.   No, when we went down from Blanko's place, we were the whole group, but I stopped at Bulelwa's place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1682"><a name="pos1682"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Did you stay at Bulelwa's corpse until (indistinct)?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1683"><a name="pos1683"></a><span class="speaker">MR AUGUST:</span> Yes, I stayed there and they proceeded.   People were going to be rounded up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1684"><a name="pos1684"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> (Indistinct), just listen, listen, did you remain at Bulelwa's body until the rest of the victims were brought into the shack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1685"><a name="pos1685"></a><span class="speaker">MR AUGUST:</span> Yes, I stayed there until Oscar and Mneba Sonti came back.   I cannot remember the others, because there were many of them, they brought these two boys, young boys, and the other one was carrying a bottle with a petrol and this cigarette carton.   From there on, an instruction was issued that others should be rounded up.   At that time, I was not there when they were taken into the shack, but I was there when they were brought, presented before the community, and thereafter it was indicated that they should round others up.   I don't know exactly who issued this order, but when we left the shack after locking them in, they parted and they said they were going to round up others.   By this time the instruction had been given out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1686"><a name="pos1686"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Eventually they were all brought together and put in a shack, is that so?   Did you ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1687"><a name="pos1687"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Answer the question first.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1688"><a name="pos1688"></a><span class="speaker">MR AUGUST:</span> Could you please repeat the question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1689"><a name="pos1689"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> You say that an instruction was issued that the others must be brought to the shacks as well?   You had to go and look for the others?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1690"><a name="pos1690"></a><span class="speaker">MR AUGUST:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1691"><a name="pos1691"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Did you go out to look for the others?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1692"><a name="pos1692"></a><span class="speaker">MR AUGUST:</span> Yes, I followed suit when they went for the second time to round the rest up.   We went on until we arrived at C, we couldn't find them, went to A and at A we found Tusanang.   We found Tusanang and we found him there, we took Tusanang along until we went to block D where we found this young boy with the light complexion, I think Jamlang is his name.   I did not know his name until today.  The one that's sitting down.   We then took them to the others who had been already rounded out when I was still there at the corpse, that is Bulelwa's corpse, Bulelwa's corpse.   From there on, it was now light.   My problem then was that I had taken my stuff, I was tired of staying the whole night outside.   It was now light, I decided to dodge, went to my place, because it was not far away from where Bulelwa was and I went to my place to rest.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1693"><a name="pos1693"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> (Inaudible)?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1694"><a name="pos1694"></a><span class="speaker">MR AUGUST:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1695"><a name="pos1695"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> To where the people were killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1696"><a name="pos1696"></a><span class="speaker">MR AUGUST:</span> It was in the morning, I was going to rest, it was now light outside.   I did go to the veld, because on waking up, it was already daylight when we took them to the veld, it may have been in the morning, but yes, the sun had risen.   I joined them when they had gathered everybody else, thereafter the commander instructed that they be taken to the veld.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1697"><a name="pos1697"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> What made you, well as I understand your evidence, you'd been drinking the previous day and you were tired and that's why you slip away into your house?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1698"><a name="pos1698"></a><span class="speaker">MR AUGUST:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1699"><a name="pos1699"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> And did you sleep at home?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1700"><a name="pos1700"></a><span class="speaker">MR AUGUST:</span> I did not leave at night, I left in the morning when we came back.   I slept, it may have been three hours, from around six or seven, I'm not sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1701"><a name="pos1701"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> What made you to go back to them, to go to the veld?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1702"><a name="pos1702"></a><span class="speaker">MR AUGUST:</span> I'm part of the SDU and therefore it was a matter of must, that after having seen what was happening, I too had to be there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1703"><a name="pos1703"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> How did you know that they went to the veld, where did you get that information from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1704"><a name="pos1704"></a><span class="speaker">MR AUGUST:</span> They were just about to leave for the veld when I arrived.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1705"><a name="pos1705"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Where were they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1706"><a name="pos1706"></a><span class="speaker">MR AUGUST:</span> They were at the shack.   Fortunately, when I arrived there, I asked where they were, and I was told they were still at the shack.   That is where I went, and shortly thereafter an order was issued that they should be taken to the veld.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1707"><a name="pos1707"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Could I just make sure, this shack, was it the first shack or the next shack right at the veld?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1708"><a name="pos1708"></a><span class="speaker">MR AUGUST:</span> This is the second shack, the one nearest to the veld.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1709"><a name="pos1709"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> The first shack, was that not the shack where Bulelwa's corpse was found?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1710"><a name="pos1710"></a><span class="speaker">MR AUGUST:</span> The second shack was only nearer to Bulelwa's corpse.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1711"><a name="pos1711"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Which shack was nearer to Bulelwa's corpse?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1712"><a name="pos1712"></a><span class="speaker">MR AUGUST:</span> The first shack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1713"><a name="pos1713"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> When you left early that morning, the victims were still in the first shack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1714"><a name="pos1714"></a><span class="speaker">MR AUGUST:</span> Yes, I left them in the first shack.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1715"><a name="pos1715"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> (Inaudible)?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1716"><a name="pos1716"></a><span class="speaker">MR AUGUST:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1717"><a name="pos1717"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> And an order was issued that they should be taken away.   Continue from there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1718"><a name="pos1718"></a><span class="speaker">MR AUGUST:</span> They were taken out of the shack and we escorted them.  I too was escorting them.   We escorted them until we arrived at the veld.   The commander then instructed them to sit down and they had their backs against us at the time.   From then on, he fired shots, that is Mchebe Dondolo, he fired using his 9mm, he fired about four shots.   From then on, the others carrying AK47's also started shooting.   Myself, with my axe, I'd say after the others had fired and had run out of bullets, Michael in particular, Rooivark, some people were still moving, that is the ones who were shot.   Mchebe then instructed that we should finish them off, and I hit the ones who were still moving, finishing them off.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1719"><a name="pos1719"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Did you finish off any person, you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1720"><a name="pos1720"></a><span class="speaker">MR AUGUST:</span> I was only concentrating on those who were still moving, because the others had already been shot and they were not moving anymore.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1721"><a name="pos1721"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> After (indistinct), what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1722"><a name="pos1722"></a><span class="speaker">MR AUGUST:</span> We then proceeded going back to the township.  On going up back to the township, we took the main road, the main tarred road that divides F and E.   We walked up to the rank, myself with my neighbour, the deceased one, we were further down, and there was a route that goes down to her place, I went to my place and parted ways with them at the corner.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1723"><a name="pos1723"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Why did you participate in the killing of these people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1724"><a name="pos1724"></a><span class="speaker">MR AUGUST:</span> Because I was a member of the SDU.   To be honest, the death of Blanko and Bulelwa hurt me so much.  As I arrived in May, in May I went back home in Eshela(?), because we had some function, traditional function, I stayed there until August, I came back in August and in the yard I had left behind Thobile Luphindo and his wife.   On arrival, I found a report from Luphindo to the effect that we now have a problem, these boys, well I didn't know them, because I just heard about them when I arrived there, he then indicated that these boys had now killed a person and they were coming back to apologise.   I was hurt and I though there is so much carelessness maybe in the SDU or among the boys, because they were part of us, and on serious consideration, I thought, I learned that these boys were no longer our party, they were now on their own.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1725"><a name="pos1725"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Was the killing of these people connected with the SDU duty to protect the community?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1726"><a name="pos1726"></a><span class="speaker">MR AUGUST:</span> Yes, that is correct, because we were trying by all means to cleanse the township of corruption and bad behaviour, because at the time we were fighting Inkatha, we ended up calling them gangsters, because that's what their deeds indicated to us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1727"><a name="pos1727"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> (Indistinct) benefited from the killing, personally?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1728"><a name="pos1728"></a><span class="speaker">MR AUGUST:</span> There may be, there may not be, if you look at this very well, you will understand that the community got peace, but I realised that the parents and the relatives of the deceased were now affected emotionally.   That is why I cannot say I personally did not benefit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1729"><a name="pos1729"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Is there anything that you received, anything of value, because you killed these people, you received, or paid, something like that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1730"><a name="pos1730"></a><span class="speaker">MR AUGUST:</span> Let me put it simple, no, I did not get anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1731"><a name="pos1731"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MADASA:</span> Thank you, Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1732"><a name="pos1732"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY ADV MADASA</p>
<p class="line" id="line1733"><a name="pos1733"></a>NO CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MAPOMA</p>
<p class="line" id="line1734"><a name="pos1734"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, Mr Sibanyoni?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1735"><a name="pos1735"></a><span class="speaker">MR SIBANYONI:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairperson, no questions from me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1736"><a name="pos1736"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And not from me, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1737"><a name="pos1737"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Motata?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1738"><a name="pos1738"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Just one or two, Mr Chairman, thank you.   Mr August, where did you find or get the axe which you used after the SDU's with AK47's have run out of bullets, namely Michael Armoed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1739"><a name="pos1739"></a><span class="speaker">MR AUGUST:</span> As a member of the SDU, I know the laws and the policies, that when things are bad outside, as we were watching over Bulelwa's body, I had to have my own weapon, where accordingly to befit a person who walks at night, just like the police wearing their uniform, we too were wearing our own clothes carrying your own axe or AK or your knobkierie.   That night I went to my place and fetched my things, because I was coming from my own place, I had drunk.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1740"><a name="pos1740"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> When you were patrolling, would you carry your axe with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1741"><a name="pos1741"></a><span class="speaker">MR AUGUST:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1742"><a name="pos1742"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Thank you, chairperson, I've got no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1743"><a name="pos1743"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> As I understand it, you say all members of the SDU knew that if there's a whistle, you've got to arm yourself and go immediately to the place where the whistle is coming from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1744"><a name="pos1744"></a><span class="speaker">MR AUGUST:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1745"><a name="pos1745"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is it correct that a member of the SDU would go to, would have been present at the place where these people were killed without being armed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1746"><a name="pos1746"></a><span class="speaker">MR AUGUST:</span> Yes, that was possible, but the rules, SDU rules, as to their operation, no-one would go to the place where the whistle was blown without being armed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1747"><a name="pos1747"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You mentioned youths who were supposed to apologise.   Who were those?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1748"><a name="pos1748"></a><span class="speaker">MR AUGUST:</span> Would you please repeat your question, Mr Chair?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1749"><a name="pos1749"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I heard you talk about some people who were supposed to apologise?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1750"><a name="pos1750"></a><span class="speaker">MR AUGUST:</span> I cannot remember very well having said anything about people who were supposed to apologise, except that when I arrived, I got an information from Luphindo that these boys came to apologise to the SDU for killing a person, yet the person is an ANC member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1751"><a name="pos1751"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When did they come to apolo..., who were those boys who came to apologise?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1752"><a name="pos1752"></a><span class="speaker">MR AUGUST:</span> It was the very same Youth League, the very ones who deserted the SDU.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1753"><a name="pos1753"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> (Inaudible)?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1754"><a name="pos1754"></a><span class="speaker">MR AUGUST:</span> I cannot say, because I also got this from the person whom I left behind at my yard, he explained to me what happened during my absence and the people who did this came to apologise to the SDU because they had killed an ANC member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1755"><a name="pos1755"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The deceased had been killed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1756"><a name="pos1756"></a><span class="speaker">MR AUGUST:</span> Yes, that is correct, they apologised after having killed the person, after killing the person, I'm not sure whether it was Majosi, and after killing the person, they learnt that they had killed a wrong person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1757"><a name="pos1757"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The boys who were coming back to apologise, what were they apologising for?   Were they apologising for killing Bulelwa and Blanko, or ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1758"><a name="pos1758"></a><span class="speaker">MR AUGUST:</span> No, they were not apologising for that, they were apologising for having killed Majosi, the one who had a spaza shop, the one who was a member of the Communist Party, yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1759"><a name="pos1759"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> (Indistinct) or Mr Madasa commence or says something arising from our questions, Mr August, Mr Mokoena, before he take leave of that seat today, he expressed sentiments to the families that of forgiveness.   Do you associate yourself with those sentiments?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1760"><a name="pos1760"></a><span class="speaker">MR AUGUST:</span> Mr Chairman, I associate myself with what he said, because it is not good that we killed these people.  Looking back, they were not living in their homes, in the shacks in which they lived, those were not their homes, after having killed these people, it transpired that we have made a mistake, we had wronged the community, and because of that, I too am one of those who are apologising, asking also on behalf of others who have not said so yet.   Those who were with us in the SDU, we too lost our temper and we were forced by circumstances at the time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1761"><a name="pos1761"></a><span class="speaker">ADV MOTATA:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairperson, I've got no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1762"><a name="pos1762"></a>NO RE-EXAMINATION BY ADV MADASA</p>
<p class="line" id="line1763"><a name="pos1763"></a>NO FURTHER CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MAPOMA</p>
<p class="line" id="line1764"><a name="pos1764"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you, Mr August, you may return to your seat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1765"><a name="pos1765"></a>	Well at this stage we will adjourn and reconvene tomorrow morning at nine o'clock.</p>
