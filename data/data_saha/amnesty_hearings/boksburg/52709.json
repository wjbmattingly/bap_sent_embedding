He introduced us - I still do not know their names, I have forgotten it during this period - and these people told us that later that day, approximately one o'clock that afternoon, they are going to the resort.  AWB people gathered there as well as the Wen Kommando for protection of the wives and children.\n\tHe then talked with them a bit more and Peet Steyn and myself drank coffee.  He talked with these women or had a conversation with them.  Then later that day, we went to town where we made forged number plates in order for them not to identify us.  We looked at the identical car, the same colour and model.  As Mr Peet Steyn gave evidence, he needed shoes and we got some food because we needed it.\n\tWe then went back to where we picked up the number plates.  From there we went to the flat, I cannot really remember the time, but it did happen like that.  Then they gave him the key in order for us to stay there until we had to go.  The evening we drove to see if we could place this bomb or detonate this bomb somewhere.\n\tThe places were still not safe, there were a lot of Police in the streets.  With this, while we were driving, he identified this building, it was a corner cafe and he said we are going to detonate the bomb here.  We agreed with him because I believed that this will have the same effect as if we planted it at the taxi rank.\n\tThe purpose of this bomb, was I believed, was they had to be scared, we wanted to create fear and they had to realise that this election would not take place, they mustn't go and vote.  The instruction was given to Peet Steyn by Jaco Nel to ignite the fuse and to throw the bomb.\n\tJaco Nel did light it, the fuse, the door was opened.

After discussion with the employer, I indicated to the representatives of the other victims, that the witness seemed to want representation outside of the Committee.\n\tThe indication was that the Wits Law Clinic may come to the assistance of that.  Mr Patel was supposed to have come through, but that hasn't materialised.  Those victims will be here tomorrow, so nothing really has taken place.\n\tThey are still being represented by the Amnesty Committee, the Evidence Leader.  Obviously I never took full instructions from them, the reasons why they wanted an independent Attorney, but that was the indication that they felt they could probably be better represented, it is their choice.\n\tAnd the indication also, they were very concerned about reparation and so from that side, I think they wanted to engage their own Attorney.

They were not really looking at us, they just said thank you, removed the brick and slowly parked the trailer in front of the shop.\n\tI asked them in Zulu why they were parking this thing in front of the shop and nobody answered.  I thought they did not understand because I was talking to them in Zulu.  They then got into the car and left.\n\tI looked at the time and I realised it was quarter to nine.  Then they left.  This white lady with whom I was working, I actually said to her, asked her why she was not asking them why they were parking it in front of it, and I thought they may have been selling something.\n\tThe trailer was not locked, but it was just closed.  I went back into the shop.  It was on the Monday.  You see I am working at a supermarket.  I came back to the outside, I just had a feeling that there was something about this trailer, I wanted to open it because it was not locked, but I heard a knock, I feared and I did not open it.\n\tAt nine o'clock, I think it was about five to nine, I went back to the door, looked at the trailer and got back into the shop again and after a while, I heard some bang.  I did not know what was happening.\n\tI screamed in the shop, it was like the whole earth was opening up.  I did not know what was happening.  I realised that I was alone in the shop.  As I was screaming for help, nobody was responding.\n\tI wanted to see, I could not because shrapnels of bottles were in my eyes.  As I was screaming for help, I can really say I was moving about like a blind person, feeling and touching things as I was moving about.\n\tI jumped some of things like the mealie meel bags that were there and some people were laying in the shop, quiet.

What I am saying here is that I have no forgiveness for these people, because of what they did.\n\tI would have liked that they not be granted amnesty, they should serve their sentences.  We have lost, we have lost so much.  Many people have lost their cars because of this, because of politics.\n\tFor example, if I were one of the AWB supporters, what would they do because I was not a member of any political organisation.  They were sent for political reasons to do what they did.  If that was to be the case, I just want to say here that if I listen carefully to what they were saying, they are saying they did not target people, but they wanted to derail the elections.\n\tThey would have targeted other places like banks, etc, and not the taxi ranks, that is if they were not targeting black people.",
