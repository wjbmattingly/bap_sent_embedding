<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Mpshe, are we ready to carry on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman and members of the committee, we are ready, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a>	Mr Chairman, I'm going to lead the evidence of the witness, Captain Jonas Hendrik De Waal.   The witness is sitting next to me, may he be made to take an oath?</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a><span class="speaker">JONAS HENDRIK DE WAAL:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR MPSHE:</span> Mr De Waal, you were a captain during the year 1993 in the SAP?</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Do you know the witness by the name of Derby, Gaye Derby-Lewis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> That's correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Is it correct that you knew her at the time when she was detained under section 29?</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> That's correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> And at that time you also had the opportunity of interrogating her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Mr De Waal, will you please tell the committee as to what happened between yourself and Mrs Derby-Lewis during the interrogation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Chairperson, I was ordered by my commander, Colonel At van Niekerk, to question the detainee at Edenvale Police Station.</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a>	I went to see her on the 24th, it was a Saturday, at 17:37 that afternoon.   With me was female Constable Strydom and a Sergeant Human.    </p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a>	We booked her out of her cells and took her to an office numbered 11.   There I offered her a chair.   She sat down and the rest of us also sat down and then I warned her according the rules of the law.   I told her that I was Captain De Waal and that I was connected to the security police and I was stationed at John Vorster Square.   I gave her the opportunity to read my certificate of appointment.  She read it.   She took her time to read all the particulars on the appointment certificate and she was satisfied that I was the person who I said I was.   After that, I told her that I had been tasked to question her in the presence of the other members of the police services, and that what she would say would be put on record, and that any other admissions could be used as evidence against her if she were to be prosecuted.   She said that she understood that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a>	I began with the questioning.   I told her that during the initial stages, I would like to have an historical report from her regarding her political involvement with right wing organisations, as well as that of her spouse, as well as an historical report regarding herself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a>	She told me that she had been born in Australia.  I said very well, that would be a good point to begin. </p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We don't want you to tell us everything that she said about her background and so on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> I'm sorry, I'm telling you this in detail.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> It was something which happened about five years ago, it's quite a long time ago.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, I think that I would be interested in knowing whether the interrogation or the questioning of Mrs Derby-Lewis was done in the ordinary course of questioning and interrogation of people, or was there something unusual about it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Where particularly did this interrogation take place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> The questioning or interrogation took place at the Edenvale Police Station buildings in office No 11.   I was tasked for this purpose because I did not live very far from the Edenvale Police Station, it was easily accessible for me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> How many times did you conduct interrogations with her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> It was on the 24th of April and then again on the 26th of April, the Monday, I continued on the 26th, I'd just like to consult my dates, and the last time that I had anything to do with her was on the 30th of April, but during this period, I saw her practically every day, apart from the 25th, until we had taken her statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Now, when you took her out for interrogation, was this recorded?</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Chairperson, the prescribed procedure was that a file would be opened, which would be in the charge office in every police station where section 29 detainees were being held, and in that sort of file there would be notes and you would record whether or not the detainee had any complaints, any other details about the detainee, where he would have taken them, whether or not they were visited by the magistrate or the station commander, any such details.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Mr Chairman and members of the committee, I'm going to refer to Exhibit Z.   The committee members do have the exhibit.   I want you to have a look at Exhibit Z in front of you and turn particularly to page 4.   At the end of page 5, there is a signature.   Is that your signature?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Now I want you to go back to page 4 then and tell the committee whether what is written thereon was written by yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Mr Chairman and members of the committee, it's the last paragraph on page 4.   Is that your own handwriting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> That is my handwriting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Was that the first interrogation you had with Mrs Derby-Lewis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Do you mind reading what you have written thereon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a>MR DE WAAL</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a>"1993, 24th of April, 17:37, detainee Derby-Lewis booked out of her cell with Sergeant Human for questioning and statement.   Had no complaints or requests and thanked me for the clothes which she received.   Questioning took place in office 11, Edenvale Police Station.   Present:  myself, Sergeant Human and female Constable Strydom.   Next time 18:55, questioning ceased at 18:55, detainee had no complaints and returned to cell.  Prints and signatures taken."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Now during this first interrogation, was there any ill-treatment of Mrs Derby-Lewis by yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Did you make any suggestions to her as to how to write her statement and what to say in her statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Now I want you to turn now to page 22, still on Exhibit Z, Mr Chairman and members of the committee, or perhaps to make a better sequence, page 19 first, let's please start at page 19.   Page 19, Mr Chairman and members of the committee.   Do you see your handwriting on that page?</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Do you mind reading what is contained thereon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> Speaker's microphone is not on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> I'm afraid mine isn't - is this a typed, a printed page, "Bylae E"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And does it start on the top, the 29th of April 1993?</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> That's right.   Do you mind reading that for us, Mr De Waal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Yes.</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a>"1993.20.5, detainee Derby-Lewis booked out for further questioning by myself, Sergeant Miller and Investigating Officer Smit.    She had no complaints."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Now I want to believe that this is the second interrogation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Chairperson, the first was on the 24th, and if I'm not mistaken, the second took place on the 26th.   Or no, this date would appear to be the 29th.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Okay, let's concentrate on the very one you have just read on page 19, did she make any statement to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> If you look at page 11, there's an entry there for the 26th made by this witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> That's correct, that is what I was referring to and that was my second date of questioning</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a>"Detainee Derby-Lewis booked out of police cell with female Constable Strydom.    Had no complaints and was taken to office No 11 at Edenvale Police Station for questioning and for statement."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Did she make any statement at the time, on the 26th of April?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> She made a statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Did she voluntarily make that statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Yes, she made a voluntary statement in her own handwriting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Did you suggest any statement or words to be included by her in her statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> No, that wasn't my style, and I had no particulars which I had to give her to put in her statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Did you on this day, the 26th of April, subject her to any form of ill-treatment in order to induce her to make that statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> No, I treated her well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Let's turn now to page 19.   You have already read page 19.</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> That is correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> On the date mentioned on page 19, the 27th of April, did she make a statement as well there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Yes, she continued with her statement, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Was she under any form of duress in making that statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Did you tell her what to write in her statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Now I want you to turn to page 22.   Is that your handwriting on page 22?</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> That is correct, the second entry, the long one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Is that the last time when you had an interrogation with her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> That is correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Would you mind reading that as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a>MR DE WAAL</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a>"2.5.87, 12:50, report.   Detainee, Mrs Derby-Lewis was booked out by a female officer and taken to be questioned.   She had a bath and she had breakfast at the police station.</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a>		At 9:10, a magistrate from Germiston visited her at Edenvale Police Station and a minister, Jooste, came round about 10:30 to visit her in room No 11, in the presence of Warrant-Officer Press of Benoni and female officer Strydom.   Warrant-Officer Strydom took her photograph, took her fingerprints, as well as handwriting samples.   </p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a>		At 11:30, I myself joined Els and female officer Strydom and Mrs Derby-Lewis.   In room No 11, I had a discussion with her, had an interview, and asked her whether she was willing to indicate the place where the so-called murder list was handed to Mr Arthur Kemp.   She said that she was willing to do that.   Afterwards, I warned her, according to judicial rules.   </p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a>		At 11:40 I asked Captain Louw to have an interview with Derby-Lewis and to take her for identification should she oblige.   During the interview, Mrs Derby-Lewis indicated that she was not willing to go for identification.   An interview was held in his office by Captain Louw.  I received a message from Colonel Van Niekerk that Mrs Lewis had to be taken to Benoni Police Station.   I requested Els and Strydom to take Mrs Derby-Lewis to Benoni Police Station at 12:35.  Sergeant Miller arrived at 12:45 at Edenvale Police Station and handed in a notice at the office that Mrs Derby-Lewis could not be detained according to section 29.   </p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a>		Signature J A De Waal."</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> What was your treatment of Mrs Derby-Lewis during this time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Mrs Lewis requested a lot of things, she required books to read, she gave me a list of the books, I bought these magazines out of my own pocket, I took them to her, she thanked me for those.    When she was questioned, you would see during the first questioning, we were busy for one hour, she said she was feeling tired, it was a long day, I booked her back into her cells, I told her that she could have a rest, I would not bother her the next day, she could have a good rest.  	When she complained or asked that she wanted to have a bath, although it was time to eat, we obliged.   We treated her very well, and she thanked us for the way in which we treated her.   She did not expect to be handled so well during detainment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Mrs Derby-Lewis has told this committee that you treated her so much that even at the time when you approached her for the first time and subsequent thereto, you did not even warn her according to the judge's rules?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> In her own words she said that I acted very professionally.  She said that she could see that we were trained very well, and she compared me to members of the Russian KGB, and she said the training we received was comparable to that training.   Well, I felt very good about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Now let's go back to the statement that she made.  Did she talk and you did the writing, or what happened?</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Mr Chairman, I asked her whether she was willing to make a statement.   She said she had no problem to make a statement and that she will start with the historical report and continue, and she started writing.  She wrote that in her own handwriting.   Female Officer Strydom typed the pages she completed in her own handwriting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> This statement, did you tell her time and again what to write in the statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> No, I did not do that at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Now the typed statement by your colleague, was this given back to her to check if that was the correct statement of what she had written?</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> After it had been typed, it was presented to her again.   She perused it and she indicated a few spelling errors, there were a few, typing errors rather, and that was corrected and she said if somebody wrote for the Patriot, she can't accept spelling errors and that was corrected.   Afterwards she said she was not satisfied with the spelling errors in the statement, she was dissatisfied with the spelling errors and she wanted to retype it without spelling errors.   We obliged, we gave a typewriter to her and it was retyped, and afterwards there were no spelling errors.</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Did you at any stage correct or attempt to correct her statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Never ever, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Mr Chairman, members of the committee, I'm going to refer to Exhibit AC.   I want you to have a look at that document, merely at the last page, and tell the committee whether that is your signature?</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> It is my signature, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Exhibit AC.   Is this the statement made by yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> That was the statement made by myself, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> I'm not going to ask you to read the statement, it is quite lengthy and members of the committee and all parties have the copy thereof.   What is the gist of this statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> This statement indicates that should there be prosecution, I would know what was in this statement and could explain it in a supreme court.</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Do you align yourself with the contents of Exhibit AC, the statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> The statement is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> That is all, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MPSHE</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Bizos, are there any questions you wish to put to the witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes, there are a few questions that I would like to put to the witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR BIZOS:</span> Mr De Waal, Exhibit Z, you told us that this is a file that was kept at the police station.   Do you recognise it as a continuous record of the important events that occurred during Mrs Derby-Lewis's detention?</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> That is correct, Mr Chairman, this file was not opened by me personally, it was opened by a member of the security police who detained her at Edenvale Police Station.  These are according to precise procedures that such a file should be opened and handed to the commanding officer at the charge office.   Whether she had a complaint at the charge office or at the magistrate, or any complaint, that was entered into that document.</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The speaker's mike is not on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Although these entries are not in your handwriting, the committee has a copy of it and you've told us that it appears to be a continuous record.   In it there are numerous entries of the comforts that were provided to Mrs Derby-Lewis, and also statements that she had no complaints.    Did she ever complain to you about anyone else ill-treating her during her detention or compelling her in any way from making any statement?   Sorry, apparently my mike goes off.   Shall I repeat the question?    Although these entries are not in your own handwriting, they set out what was done for her and how her requests were met, and on numerous occasions that she had no complaint.    What I want to ask you is that the relationship that you had with her, which you say was a friendly one, did she herself complain about anyone having ill-treated her or had induced her in any way to make any false statements?</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> She had no complaints at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Now, were you a member of the investigation team in relation to the murder of Mr Hani in a full-time capacity, or had you been called in merely for the purposes of obtaining a statement from Mrs Derby-Lewis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Mr Chairman, no, I was part of the investigation team, right from the beginning to the end.  I had various tasks and at that stage Colonel Van Niekerk tasked me to question her and obtain a statement from her, would she be willing to give one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Did you apprise Colonel Van Niekerk of any portions of the statement as it was being prepared by you and Mrs Derby-Lewis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> That is correct, Mr Chairman.   I was tasked that report should be provided to headquarters in Pretoria every day regarding the progress in our investigation, information which we could obtain from the statement by means of questioning would have to be provided to head office.   At certain stages, on a daily basis, and sometimes every second day, I went to Benoni and took parts of her statement to the colonel.   I presented it to him, he read it, and told me that he does not agree with certain parts of the statement, because her husband or Mr Janusz Walus made different, provided different information.   I was unaware of what was contained in the statements of these two gentlemen.  I just accepted that her statement was correct.  He tasked me, I went back to her and said,</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a>"Mrs Lewis, certain parts of this statement differ from Derby-Lewis's and Walus's statements".</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a>	She asked me what the differences were, and I told her, and then she would say yes, now she remembered, she had made a mistake.   </p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a>	One incident I can remember, she told me that her husband had never showed her any firearm, and when I indicated that difference, she said yes, now she remembered, and she made the changes herself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Did you put any pressure on her to agree or disagree with the information that you had obtained from Colonel Van Niekerk?</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> I did not put any pressure on her, I just told her that the colonel had said that some parts of her statements differed from those of Walus and Derby-Lewis, and if she said that was correct, I left it at that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Did she ever contradict the information that was given to you by the colonel, and say, "No, that information is incorrect", did she ever say that, did she feel free to say that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> In all honesty, Mr Chairman, it could have been, but I can't remember.   It could have been that at that part of the statement, she left it was it was and said that was what happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Now, I want you to please have a look at R4, pages 149 to 163.</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Mr Chairman, could we just get the page number again please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes, 149 to 163 of R4, Mr Chairman.   I notice some difficulty with Judge Wilson's papers - as long as it's there, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a>	Now, is this a statement which was signed by Mrs Derby-Lewis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And does your signature also appear on there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Yes, page 163, on the right-hand top side.</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Did you, at the time that you signed this, or before that, induce her in any way, or threaten her in any way, to sign this statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> I would never have done that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Would you please have a look at 164 to 195?   In whose handwriting is this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> That is the handwriting of Mrs Derby-Lewis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And does her signature appear at page 195?   It's the last page of the handwritten...</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> That's correct, at the bottom there is my signature, my details and my address.</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Did you at any time either threaten or induce her in any manner to write this statement out or to sign it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> No.   It was with her full co-operation and it was done voluntarily.   There was never any kind of threat.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Insofar as she may have complained about being tired or not entirely in her full and sober senses, do you consider this, looking at it, as a consequential and well-written statement in an excellent handwriting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> I would have to agree with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Could you please turn to page 211?   Whose handwriting - 211 to page 239 - could we go to the bottom of 238, whose signature is that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> That is my signature, with my details.</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> That's on 239, go to 238, at the bottom of the page, 238, right at the bottom of the page, whose signature is that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> That is the signature of Mrs Derby-Lewis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And who wrote this statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Mrs Derby-Lewis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And there are, there is at least one alteration on that page, who is it initialled by?</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Mrs Derby-Lewis made these deletions herself, she signed there and it was police regulations that the officer present would also place his initials and his rank, as well as the date, there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.   Did you exercise any undue influence on her in any kind in order to sign this statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Please go to page 260 to 268.   This is headed</p>

<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> That is correct, chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And did you work directly under Colonel Van Niekerk, who was the commanding officer of John Vorster Square?</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> So you reported to Colonel Van Niekerk?</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And Colonel Van Niekerk, on his turn, reported to Major General Du Toit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And General Du Toit reported to head office?</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And you were connected to the Security Branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> In conjunction with Captain Deetliefs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And he was also well-known to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Yes, he was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> As well as Warrant-Officer Beetge?</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Well I didn't undertake questionings or interrogations with him, but I did know him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> He was also a member of the Security Branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Not of my branch, but of another branch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> But he was a member of the investigative unit of the Security Branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And Sergeant Strydom was also a member of the Security Branch, the lady?</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> No, the lady was a constable and she was connected to the Uniform Branch at Edenvale Police Station.</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> During this investigation Mrs Derby-Lewis was detained in terms of section 29 of Internal Security?</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And those commands were issued by your commanding officer, Colonel Van Niekerk, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Well the arrest of, or the procedure by means of which Mrs Derby-Lewis was detained was not issued by myself, I simply undertook the investigations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> You were aware that she was detained and questioned in terms of section 29 of Internal Security?</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And surely you acted in terms of the orders from your commanding officer, Colonel Van Niekerk?</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And he issued orders to you with relation to the questioning of Mrs Derby-Lewis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Well I cannot agree with that.   He was aware of my activities and he knew, or he stated that her version of the facts differed from that of her spouse and he mentioned that to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> You worked only under the orders of Colonel Van Niekerk, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And you had nothing to do with Murder and Robbery, that was not your branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> No, that was not my branch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I beg your pardon, I am speaking rather quickly, I will speak a little slower.   Captain, Colonel Human was in charge of Murder and Robbery?</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And those were two separate branches of the South African Police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And your investigation was handled separately, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> We were a co-operative team, or a joint team, but our orders came from our security officers to our security members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And during the questioning of Mrs Derby-Lewis, there is evidence which indicates that videotapes were made specifically while your colleague, Captain Van Niekerk, or at least Captain Deetliefs questioned her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> I was not aware of that.   I have no knowledge of that, it could be so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Captain, you and your colleagues who were involved with this investigation, which was quite an important investigation, surely must have consulted or had discussions regarding how this issue would be handled, especially in terms of your commanding officer, Captain Van Niekerk and Colonel Deetliefs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Colonel Deetliefs at that stage was busy with Janusz Walus's questioning, as well as that of Mrs Derby-Lewis.   I had to take over because the pressure became too much for him, he had too much on his plate, and I had to take over so that he could proceed with Mr Janusz Walus, that is why it happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Captain, it was your determined task to gather as much information as possible in terms of this case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And Captain, surely it was the objective of section 29 that if someone were to be detained under the stipulations of that Act, that information should be collected?</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And that information which was gathered had to be correlated to see whether or not it was true?</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And that information would be expected to be gathered from the person who you were questioning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> You yourself would have possessed certain information in order to question such a person, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> I had no information from other people, with all honesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Therefore you had no information or other information regarding the case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> The only information I had was that a murder was committed, that Mr Hani had been murdered, and I was connected with the investigative unit and I was ordered to be part of the investigation, that Mr Hani had been murdered and that the suspects had to be gathered and that they would be questioned and that we should undertake a complete investigation in order for the supreme court's prosecution of the suspects.   That is all that happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Captain, you were aware that your colleague, Colonel Deetliefs, had already questioned Mrs Derby-Lewis at various events?</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> I had questioned her and Colonel Deetliefs before me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> How many times exactly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you see any of his notes, any of the questions that he had asked?</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you at any stage acquire any notes of Captain Deetliefs which he might have made while questions Mrs Gaye Derby-Lewis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Therefore how would you be able to perform a task, not knowing anything about the case, and then undertake questioning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> I don't know how you can say that I knew nothing of the case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well the most logical supposition would be that questioning had been undertaken by Captain Deetliefs for some or other purpose, he must have taken notes, and he must have reported to Colonel Van Niekerk what had surfaced during the questioning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Yes, I agree, he would have reported to Colonel Van Niekerk, but those notes were not at my disposal, I had no knowledge of what was contained in those notes, I did not see anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Therefore, you didn't know anything?</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> I was told to proceed with Mrs Derby-Lewis's questioning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Proceed to what, where did it end?</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Well I don't know how far Captain Deetliefs had come with her questioning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well you were told to proceed, where did he stop?</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> I don't know how far Captain Deetliefs managed to proceed with Mrs Derby-Lewis.   I was tasked to proceed with Mrs Derby-Lewis as if it was the first time that I would be involved with her.   Her admissions to Captain Deetliefs were none of my knowledge.</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Therefore it would have been a futile exercise, those couple of days?</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Well I wouldn't have known what she said to him....</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I'll proceed to another point, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, I think that you should not investigate, this is really not particularly relevant.   It might be relevant in another tribunal, but certainly not here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Captain, so you've already said that you had - in terms of the stipulations of section 29, persons were compelled to answer questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Well they could refuse.</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Captain, why would someone be detained in terms of section 29, and be honest about it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> I have said it before and I will repeat, in order to retrieve as much information as possible from the person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And how would you retrieve this information if they refused to answer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Well then you would not retrieve it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And then would you ask that he be detained for a further ten days?</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Yes, I would have requested that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> You would coerce the person into answering the questions by remaining there for a further ten days?</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Well, until the Minister of Law and Order had said no further detention, which would have happened at those times, he would be released and it would be out of my hands and...(tape ends)</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Captain, you said that you warned Mrs Derby-Lewis in terms of judicial rules?</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> At the beginning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And you told her that she should sketch a background of herself, a report?</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Yes, that is how I would commence with any investigation or questioning, I would like a complete report of the person's background.</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And that she had to do in terms of the judicial rules?</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Can you tell this, or show this committee, can you please show the honourable committee, in any of Mrs Derby-Lewis's statements, where you warned her in terms of judicial rules, judge's rules?</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> I have explained this in my statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Do you understand the question?   You were not a new constable, you knew that you had to put the judge's rules in writing and ask the person if they understood what these rules were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> There are copied statements in terms of this issue which are held at the station.   I would have explained to her what I was going to ask, and you will see in my statement that all the elements of judge's rules were set out there, why are you attacking me personally?</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I'll put the question to you once more, was this statement to be used for the purposes of evidence, is that what you're saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Well, if the attorney-general thought that there would be prosecution, then this would have been used as evidence in prosecution, I would have testified in terms of this evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> In every case which is submitted to court, there is a clear and written document and I'm referring to the Security Branch, which was quite particular about it, the judge's rules would be set out clearly, where a person would sign and confirm that they understood those rules, do you agree?</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Chairperson, it was not compulsory to use that form.   If you wished to set out the judge's rules in your statement, it would have been fine, it was not something which was issued by police regulations, it was something which we copied for ourselves in order to create more easier facilitation in dealing with suspects.   We did not have to use that form.</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Nowhere in any of the statements of Mrs Derby-Lewis which is submitted to this committee, does it say that she understood exactly what the judge's rules entailed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> I think I have explained to you that it was not necessary to use that form, that's why I didn't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I'm asking you the question, would you simply answer it.   Do you agree?</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Just hold on.   Is your contention, your client's contention, or Mrs Derby-Lewis's contention that she was never told about the judge's rules?   Is that your ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Not by the captain, that's correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It doesn't matter, was she aware of the judge's rules?</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Mr Chairman, she was not warned by the captain in terms of judge's rules.</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well then just put it to her that she wasn't warned, you see?   Otherwise we're going to have an argument here about the way he went about it and the way you are saying it ought to have been done.</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> With respect, Mr Chairman, as it's done daily in every court case, a person is warned ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, just put it to her ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> ...in writing ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> ...and he deny, he doesn't want to agree to that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And he says no, it isn't always done that way, there is a form in which the judge's rules are set out and that he said to her ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I put it to you, Captain, that at no stage you warned Mrs Derby-Lewis regarding judge's rules?</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> What I have written there is the truth.   I warned her in terms of judge's rules, I showed my appointment certificate to her, she read it herself and everything that I have testified here has been the truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And I put it further ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> No, Mr Chairman, in fairness to the witness, I must draw the committee's attention to page 211</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a>"I, Gabriel Maroela Derby-Lewis, hereby voluntarily make a supplementary statement under oath in English."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a>So that I think that the witness is entitled to have his attention drawn, once this attack is made on him, that his client, or rather his witness, or the spouse of his client, in her own handwriting said that she voluntarily had made at least that one statement.   We will argue what the effect of it is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Captain, this section which Mr Bizos has just read makes no reference to judge's rules, is that correct, and I put it to you that in order to detain someone in terms of section 29, it would be contradictory to tell the person, "I'm warning you, you don't have to make a statement", while the colonel said, "You will talk".</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Where did you get the idea that the colonel told her that she would talk, I wasn't present when that happened?   No pressure was exercised on her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Sir, if section 29 was explained to her in such a way, you would not be able to argue that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> I've never heard of someone being told that they will talk.</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And at this point I would also like to put it to you that before another commission where application was also being made for amnesty, that the Security Branch specifically in terms of section 29 made use of methods which would not normally be prescribed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> My procedures were those that were normally used.   You should not connect me with those elements, I was a professional police officer and I performed my duties in a professional manner.</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> You regarded her as a suspect, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Yes, I did regard her as a suspect and I'm surprised that she was never charged, I was surprised that she was never charged.</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Do you know that before the judge-president in the supreme court, with the two applicants, she appeared in the court, that she was found not guilty of all the charges?</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> That is my opinion, according to the statement that I received from her, she was lucky that she was never charged.</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Captain, will you answer the question please?  She was charged and she was found not guilty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think you should know, maybe your memory is failing you, she was in fact charged, she was in the trial and she was found not guilty.   It might have escaped you, but that is what in fact happened.   Carry on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Why did you tell the committee that she was never charged?   Why are you misleading the committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> I'm not misleading anyone.   This matter occurred five years ago.</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> This was a very controversial issue in the media.</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Yes, it was very controversial, she was not, she's not in detention, her husband and his accomplice are in detention.</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> You went on and said that she was a suspect and emphasised that you were surprised that she had not been charged.   Since when does one take an affidavit from a suspect?</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> I don't understand what you mean by that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> You ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, I think please, let's just move on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> With respect, Mr Chairman, it's crucial, if a person is a suspect in a trial, you don't take a sworn statement from him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, well at any section 29 inquiry, she was detained under section 29 and a statement was in fact taken, these are the statements we've got before us.   Now how much further can you take it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Mr Chairman, the only, what I'd like to ask the witness, why was a sworn statement taken from the witness?</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well it was in fact taken, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Mr Chairman, I respectfully submit it's not procedure ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> All right, then the procedure ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> ...and that's the point I want to make as to what is the case of the witness, Mrs Derby-Lewis?    You took an affidavit and told Mrs Derby-Lewis that she would be used as a witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> I never said that.   In terms of section 29, it would be an affidavit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That is why the judge's rules do not appear in this statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> But she was made aware of the judge's rules and the statement was written in her own handwriting, and that is why she didn't mention the judge's ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Could I just ask you something here?   You've just told us the statement was in her own handwriting and she didn't mention the judge's rules, but, where is the first statement by her, 164 is it?   Yes.   At the end of that statement, she has written, at page 195</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a>"I know and understand the contents of this statement.   I have no objection to taking the prescribed oath.   I consider the prescribed oath to be binding on my conscience."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a>I take it she was told to write that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> That is correct. those three sentences, this is the way of concluding a statement.   That I've told her to write, those last three sentences are part of an affidavit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> You told her rights in the case of each one of them, but you've never told her to write that she had been warned in terms of the judge's rules?</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> This form, she did not know this form of a sworn statement, that's why I told her how to do it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> When you took the statement for the first time, you told her that she had to provide a historical background?</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Why did she have to be warned according to judge's rules, what did that have to do with the allegations against her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Mr Chairman, that was just to get a complete statement from her, from the beginning to the end, I wanted to get a complete statement and that was how we went about in the Security Police with the historical statement, that was to get a full picture of this person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> It was the practice in the Security Police, Captain, I want to put it to you, that every person who was detained according to section 29 who could write, was asked to write his background in his own writing, am I correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> I don't know about practice, but that was what I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Do you agree that a practice like that existed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> It was not used by all the Security Branch members, it differed from member to member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Where were you stationed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> I was at Security Branch, Sandton, and I was attached to John Vorster.   I was stationed at Morningside.</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> In your own statement, AC, you say one page 1</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a>"I told her that at that stage we would just take a background information from her regarding her political career and an historical history, and that on Monday I would provide a complete statement.    The reason for that is that there are documentation found in her possession which I would like to study, and which I want more information about."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Captain, are you tell the honourable committee that she wrote her statement regarding her background and then she stopped, is that what you're saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> I'm not understanding your question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Are you telling the committee that she started writing a statement regarding her background and then she stopped until you had the time to study whatever you wanted to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Yes, I wanted to study the diary she had in her possession.</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Can you tell the committee where she stopped and where she started, can you indicate on her statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> She stopped where she had stopped writing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Can you indicate where on the statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ja, just tell me, can you tell me now, please, I want you to assist me, what is the relevance of all this kind of cross-examination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I respectfully submit ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You see, in another tribunal the value of her evidence and so on might be of grave concern, but here as to when she gave her history and when she gave the rest of her story and so on, precisely of what importance is it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I respectfully submit, Mr Chairman, it's relevant to the credibility of this witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, then I'm not interested in allowing you to proceed with the credibility of this evidence, if that is the only purpose.    You have, her statements are here, she has not denied making those statements, so there's no point in challenging the credibility of witness on the question of procedure that he followed or did not follow.</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I respectfully submit, Mr Chairman, that her version is she was told what to say by this witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well then you put it to her and she wrote it voluntarily and her statement says that she wrote it voluntarily.</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I respectfully submit, Mr Chairman, in view of the fact that she was detained in terms of section 29, that she was in the hands of the Security Branch.</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well then that's, the value of her evidence and so on, that would be a matter for another tribunal, you understand?   She could have said in a court of law, "My statement was a section 29 statement, it is inadmissible", and the Court would have said, "Yes, it's inadmissible".</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> But, Mr Chairman, with respect, how do I dispute this witness' evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You're not disputing his evidence, you are merely saying that he didn't follow certain procedure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well I put the version of the witness to him as well, after I examined him, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well I think that you'd better proceed further along the lines, but I don't think we can go on questioning along these lines to test his credibility on these issues.</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Captain, is it correct that Mr Mpshe and Mr Bizos consulted with you, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Only this, early this morning, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> You said Colonel Van Niekerk was not satisfied with her statement, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> I did not say that, I said parts, certain portions of these statements he did not agree with because it differed from that of her husband.</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And because there was a difference in the evidence, he wanted her to put it right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> No, I questioned her and I told her that Van Niekerk had said, "These portions of your statements do not agree with your husband's".</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you tell her what her husband had said?  you did not tell her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Yes, yes, I told her what her husband had said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> What did you tell her exactly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> What was contained in his statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you ask her to write down what her husband had said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> No, I told her that orally.</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you keep any notes regarding what you've just told the committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> It happened five years ago, but it could have been in the interrogation file.</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Where is this file kept?</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> That interrogation file or the files are filed at Murder and Robbery, and the investigative officer was Mike Holmes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Can I come in here again please?   As I understood your evidence when you were questioned by Mr Bizos, you said you would go back to her and tell her what Colonel Van Niekerk had told you, and in some cases she would say yes, now she remembered it, and would correct it herself.   Now is this statement we have before us a corrected statement, because I don't see any corrections on it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Mr Chairman, with respect, the answer did not mean that, well perhaps I shouldn't say anything, but before putting that question, with respect, Mr Chairman, he should be asked how the final statement came into being?</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Precisely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The speaker's mike is not on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Is this statement the corrected statement, not the statement she (indistinct).</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The speaker's mike is not on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Well, somebody could perhaps repair the mike.  The statement, it's not the statement that she made on the date that appears at the end of the statement, is that the position?</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> The wrong statement was corrected, this is the correct statement you have in front of you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Yes, now when was, when was this statement made, the corrected statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> If I obtained a statement from her on the 24th and I saw her again on the 26th of April, I told her that the colonel did not agree with certain parts of her statement, and then she corrected that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Yes, well now that's what I want to know about, because it is a long handwritten document that runs over the pages, how did she correct it?   Did she carefully re-write three lines so she didn't have to re-write the whole statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Mr Chairman, the parts which were not correct, she re-wrote the correct part, and she tore up the wrong part.</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Did she re-write it in such a way that in each case of an alteration, it was only one page and the other pages could remain as they are, or did she have to re-write the whole document?</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> No, Mr Chairman, there was very little where there was a difference, where there was a dispute, it was only small parts of the statement on which we differed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> We'll take the short adjournment at this stage and resume in 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a>COMMITTEE ADJOURNS</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Captain, these sections which you say that Mrs Derby-Lewis had written and then were subsequently destroyed, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> What is the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Upon a question by His Honour Judge Wilson you said that there were certain changes that had been made and they were no longer available, they had been destroyed, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> So therefore it could never be shown to anyone ever again after that in order to determine its value?</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> So it could have been to her advantage or to her disadvantage, do you agree?</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Yes I do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And you are aware that when someone writes a statement or when a magistrate takes a confession, it may not be destroyed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Well if the person wishes to correct their statement, I do not see a problem with it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> But you do know what she wrote?</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Well it was five years ago, I cannot remember anymore.</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> At the time that she was writing it, you knew what she was writing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> But you could have put those pieces together?</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> I wanted a correct version of the events, there were certain aspects where she said she wanted to protect and she wanted to correct that, and I wanted the correct version of the incident.</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Captain, at the end of the day, the Court would have been the arbitrator, not you, the Court would have had to decide what the value of it was, not you, what the truth was, not you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> As I've said, I wanted the truth before me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Do you agree that if that part of the evidence was not before the Court, there was something missing, do you agree?</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> According to me, the statement which she made was the truth.   The versions which she gave and the clauses where she said she wanted to protect someone and she wanted to correct it, especially in terms of the weapon, were brought into my statement regarding those aspects which were changed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> How did you know that that was the correct version?</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Well, Colonel Van Niekerk told me that Mr Derby-Lewis had made a statement such as that in his statement, I went back and questioned her regarding this and she told me that she had told a lie, that she had made a mistake and that she wanted to rectify it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> So the other sections ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Prinsloo please, no, Mr Prinsloo, please I don't think you should, I think you should ask this type of question within the context of your client's own version.   As far as I can recall, she never said, "I did tell the truth, I was caused to discard the truth in favour of the untruth".   So you are proceeding on the premise as if your client had said that what she had initially written was true and then later she was caused to throw it away and then accept something which was true.   That was not her evidence, and you go on therefore to argue on the premise, you go on to argue that well, what she had, what was discarded could have been to her advantage, and that argument is based on the premise that she had told the truth initially, but that's not what she said.   All she said was that she said certain things and then later she was confronted with other things, and as a result her statement was change.</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> With respect, the way I understand it is that she was told what to say with regard to certain aspects and that the version which the captain presents here is that certain things were changed and they were destroyed and we don't what that was, that is what I'm aiming at, that that section of the evidence which had been destroyed can no longer be considered in terms of the evidence which appears in the statement, there is, there's some kind of empty space and that is what I'm aiming at.</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But I mean don't you understand the point my brother is making, you see, if she maintained that the documents which you had thrown away were in fact the truth and her present statement is what she was told to say, now that is not what her version was, you understand?</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> With respect, Mr Chairman, her version is that she was told what to say, where it didn't agree, she had to re-write it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, but she maintains it was the truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Mr Chairman, she said, she indicated to the portions of the statement that was not true, she did indicate that in her evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> She said that, look at the end of the statement, each statement that she makes, where she affirms its contents as being the truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> With respect, Mr Chairman, she says she was told what to say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, well all right, you can use that in argument.</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And really what's the value of that statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You can use that as argument, it seems, because you can't cross-examine this witness on evidence that has been destroyed without us knowing.   How are you going to discuss ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Can you give us the reference to what she said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I'll have to find it, Mr Chairman.   What I've also got here, Mr Chairman, is what she said in A1, which was also handed in, a note she made as to what - for instance at page 6 of that Exhibit A1, which I can just find now, she wrote at paragraph 15 of A1</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a>"He said I must re-write parts of my statement, that Clive had said that this and that, when I, for example told him I can't remember when he asked me when something had happened, if, as if something happened, then he would say, `Well, you'll sit here until you can remember' or `We'll detain you further'."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a>That's with reference to De Waal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well all that really boils down to the value that we attach to her evidence, isn't it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That's correct, Mr Chairman ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> ...in conjunction of the captain's evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, well now carry on then, I think what evidential value there is in her statement is a factor which we'll take into account.   I think my difficulty with your line of cross-examination is that it was based on the assumption that what the witness subsequently discarded was in fact the truth, my difficulty was that you base your cross-examination on the assumption or on the premise that what she had initially said, but subsequently changed, albeit at the instance of the police, was the truth, and I'm saying that you can't say that unless the witness herself had said to us, "What I initially said was the truth until the police came and caused me to change it".   She never, that was not her evidence.   In fact my impression was that she lied, that's what the general impression she conveyed, the impression she conveyed was that initially she lied, and then later when she was confronted with something else, then she changed, and you proceed on the premise which is based on the opposite.</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> With respect, Mr Chairman, the purpose of my question was directed at the captain to indicate that by destroying the document, we are now not in a position to see - to evaluate what was said, that's my whole purpose.</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But what was the point, why should we miss something which was untrue, why must we be bothered to evaluate something which was in any case untrue, how are we prejudiced?</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Mr Chairman, we don't know what was said in that context, whether it was true or untrue, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well what did she say about it, I don't care what you know, it's what did she say anywhere in her evidence, "I had the truth in my statement and I was compelled to change it to put in something untrue"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Her evidence is, Mr Chairman, with respect, that she was told what to say.   She said in her evidence she never saw a weapon, and here it is stated she saw a weapon.   It was added to the statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> (Indistinct) attention was drawn to the fact that this is what her husband had said, and she says now, "Yes, I remember that this is what in fact happened, I did see the weapon".   Now can you take it very much further than that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well the point is, Mr Chairman, with respect, if she's told by the captain to write that, then it makes a big difference, because that's not her version then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In other words, she was now compelled to write what was the truth, is that what you're saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well I'm not saying that's the truth what's written in the statement, Mr Chairman, with respect, she said it's untrue, she never saw a weapon, which is written in the statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.   Can we proceed to some other aspect of the case please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Captain ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Mr Chairman, if Judge Wilson is looking at the record, I have already reference of Mrs Derby-Lewis's evidence, it's set out on page 65 of our heads of argument, Mr Chairman, but it will just identify some of the references.</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> In your statement you refer to a murder list, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> But nowhere in Mrs Derby-Lewis's statement is there mention made of a murder list?</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> So why do you mention a murder list?</p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Well that is what was discussed at our conference.</p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I beg your pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> We spoke about the murder list amongst our members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> So it became known as the murder list?</p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> So your statement in that relation is not correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> I see it as murder list because various individuals were murdered.</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> What you are saying in your statement is what Mrs Derby-Lewis should have said?   What you are saying in your statement is that which Mrs Derby-Lewis had said to you, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> In the statement she also mentioned the murder list.</p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> In her statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> No, not in her statement, but that is what she said to me, it was regarded as a murder list.</p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Where did she record that in her statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> There was a section which was amended, she maintained a version that this list was compiled because she wanted to write an article about the names on the list, those persons, and after that I said that that was not the version of her spouse and she subsequently changed her opinion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> So therefore after it was told to her what her spouse had said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Yes, that was one of the issues that Colonel Van Niekerk told me to take up with her, whether or not it was true that she wanted to write an article about these persons or whether her husband's version was true, she changed her opinion, she said that her husband's version was in fact the truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> The statement, the first statement which she wrote, was about background and then proceeded to cover aspects regarding the merits of the case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Earlier I asked you where she had stopped after you told her to write and then you would discuss certain aspects with her after you had studied certain information?</p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> You addressed these aspects before, but I will answer again and that is that I cannot possibly remember that far back, that which is before me here is her complete statement and she is completely aware of everything contained in the statement, where she stopped and where she proceeded once more I would not be able to give you detailed information of.</p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> In terms of her statement, this was on the 24th of April, and it, or the first statement finished on the 27th of April, and she had written the statement in the office, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And the police, female police officer typed it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> After she had written it, she went through it, she studied it again, I testified that she had admonished the female police officer regarding spelling mistakes, but there was nothing wrong with the statement itself, but that she did not approve of the spelling mistakes, she wanted to type it up herself.   She did, there were no more spelling mistakes and she agreed with everything that was said in the statement.   Why, when she studied the statement again, did she not point out certain facts which she was not satisfied with, why did she only point out spelling mistakes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> A simple question, but what I would like to know is that from the 24th to the 27th, during the rendition of this statement, there was a certain point where she was not questioned, there was a break in the questioning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Yes, there was a certain break.   I stopped on the Saturday and then continued on the Monday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> It's a very long statement, it was written over quite a long period of time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And it was re-written neatly, the final draft?</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Yes, it was typed, she typed it herself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Can you please point out to the committee which changes were brought to the statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Initially, this morning, I testified that she made certain zig-zag patterns where she deleted certain things, and that is clearly indicated.   I testified that it was police policy that certain deletions would have to be dated and initialised, I did so and she did so as well, that was police procedure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Mrs Strydom wasn't a very good typist, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Well, according to my opinion, there were a number of spelling mistakes.   I think it was rather petty to admonish her regarding the spelling mistakes, but we wanted to keep Mrs Derby-Lewis satisfied, we didn't want her to have any problems with the statements at the end of the day and that is why we gave her permission to re-type the statement herself.   We didn't want her to point out any errors or spelling mistakes afterwards, that's why we gave her the typewriter and allowed her to re-type it herself, after which she was satisfied with the final product, that there were no errors whatsoever.</p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Various statements were made by her, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> When were the statements typed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> While she was busy, when she had written a page, she handed it over to the typist, who would sit there and type these pages next to her, page for page, she received the information from her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Perhaps you don't understand the question.   When did Mrs Derby-Lewis type the final statement, on which day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> It is mentioned here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> The three statements, were they typed on the last day or as she had completed each and every one of them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> No, when the statement had been finished and sworn and studied, she would type it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> So that would have been on the 27th of April?</p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> No, that would be when the statements had been completed and the dates appear on the statements.</p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> But then with the second statement she had to record things that had already been mentioned in background, what was the relevance of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Well that, for example, had to do with the list of names, the organisations which she belonged to, we wanted all these details, whether or not the Court would use it wasn't important, we wanted it for information purposes in the Security Branch and that is why the colonel asked that I question her specifically regarding organisations and the list, and that is why we received information regarding those issues, whether or not it was in the interests of the Court, it was valuable to us within the field where we were working.</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> The State Advocate Von Lieres, who managed the case on behalf of the State, and his junior Advocate Nel, did they consult with you regarding that case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Were you ever called to testify?</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And I also put it to you that not one of the members of the Security Branch, Colonel Van Niekerk, yourself, Captain Deetliefs, ever testified during that trial?</p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Do you know why not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Were these statements made available to the State?</p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> These statements, according to me, had to have made up a certain part of the dossier which the presiding officer had compiled regarding the case.</p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> You are speaking of the section 29 statements?</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> All the statements which were received.</p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> But your statements were specifically the section 29 statements, that is what you managed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Yes, but if I had managed the dossier or the file, it would definitely have appeared in that dossier.</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Just a moment please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a>	Honourable Chairperson, the page 405 of Mrs Derby-Lewis's statement, you have mentioned that Mrs Derby-Lewis was warned by you in terms of her admissions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Yes, that was procedure, it had to be done that way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And once again you did not write out the judge's rules there for her to sign and confirm that she understood them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> I think it's very clear that I was impartial in this respect.    When she said that she didn't wish to make the admissions, we left it at that, because that was procedure, there were no irregulations, no undue pressure was placed upon her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> You didn't want her to make the identification towards you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> No, it had to be done by an impartial officer. MR PRINSLOO:  And that would have been managed by Captain Louw?</p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> So what was the necessity for you to warn Mrs Derby-Lewis regarding judge's rules, if that wasn't necessary?</p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Well that would be procedure, one had to warn her, "This could be used against you, are you prepared to do it?"   She declared herself willing to me, and I took her to the captain and that is how it was done, and that is where she changed her mind and she was taken back the captain said that she didn't want to do it, and that was that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> This is the first that I hear of it, that you warned someone who was asked to make an identification, because according to this version, Captain Louw had warned her in terms of judge's rules and she had refused then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> That was Captain Louw's procedure.   He didn't know her, it was the first time he was seeing her and it was his prerogative to warn her in terms of judge's rules, and I said to him, "This person is willing to make identifications, will you interview her?"   After that she had changed her mind and she didn't want to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I put it to you that Mrs Derby-Lewis was warned by the captain in terms of judge's rules and that it was the first time that she learnt that she was actually involved a section 29 matter and that she actually had a choice which she didn't have before?</p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Why would I then have taken her to Captain Louw and why didn't I take her through the identification myself, if that was the case?   Is that not proof of my impartiality, that I chose an independent officer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Then she exercised her choice not to make an identification, while she said to you, according to your version, that she was willing.   Isn't it strange?</p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> It's not strange, it has happened before, it has happened many times in the past where people change their minds.   Someone says to you they would like to make a confession to a magistrate and as soon as they get to the magistrate, they have changed their mind and that they don't want to do it, this happens.</p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And at the end, you knew, on the 27th or 26th of April, according to your version, that Mrs Derby-Lewis had made an application for her release?</p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And from that moment forward, you continued to question her and receive statements?</p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Yes, it was my right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you inform her that this kind of application had been made?</p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> I can't remember, it's possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line546"><a name="pos546"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> But there is nothing in writing that you did inform her?</p>
<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Well she was a detainee, I cannot remember, I may or may not have informed her regarding this, according to me, she was a detainee, there was no document that had been issued saying that she should be released by the Minister, and if that had been so, I would have been compelled to release her, but until such a document had been issued, I would have continued with my work.</p>
<p class="line" id="line548"><a name="pos548"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And she never had any legal assistance or access to the law while she was detained?</p>
<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> No, in terms of section 29, she had no right to that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And you are aware that during her interview with Captain Deetliefs before she was detained in terms of section 29, she repeatedly asked for legal assistance?</p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> I'm not aware of that, I was not present when Mr Deetliefs questioned her or when any arrangements were made between the two of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Why did you not make use of a videotape, as with other cases, when you knew that allegations were always made about the Security Branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> I was not even aware that a videotape had been made with Mr Walus, I only knew which methods were used with his interviews.   My instructions - in all the interviews that I had made during my years at the Security Branch, I never used a videotape.</p>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> But some officers did?</p>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Yes, certain officers did use videotapes, it wasn't compulsory though.</p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> But it would have assisted you greatly today if you had material on video.</p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> In order to determine exactly what happened, for example in cells, if there was 24 hour monitoring in John Vorster Square, there would be videotape material.</p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, he didn't make himself a videotape, he has said so, neither do we have any reason to think that it was standard practice for the police to do that, to make use of ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Captain, this detention file is compiled by the Security Police, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> It's for the purposes of the Security Police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Yes, we provide it to the charge office and also the persons, the magistrates, the district surgeons, the officers who were working during the weekends, and they make a note whether a person has any problems.   All the, the charge office does not have such files and we provide it for this purpose.</p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> The charge office has an occurrence book which gives 100% report on what is happening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> That is correct.   Whether everything is reported I don't know, but they should keep up an occurrence book.</p>
<p class="line" id="line566"><a name="pos566"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> This file regarding her detainment, has that been kept up to date?</p>
<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line568"><a name="pos568"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I looked at it this morning.   If you look at Exhibit Z, page 5, are you on page 5, Mr Chairman?    Right at the top there's an entry?</p>
<p class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line570"><a name="pos570"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> The 24th of April, it's just before six o'clock in the evening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> 17:35, just after half past six.</p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> It's actually five - it's five to seven, but in any case, on the 25th of April at 7:50 it has an entry by Strydom saying</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a>"Visit Mrs Derby-Lewis, she complains of stomach ache and heart ache.   I took her to have breakfast and to have a bath."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a>Do you see that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> I see that, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> This is a serious complaint if you have a heart ache?</p>
<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> The procedures if such a complaint was made is that the uniform people should get a doctor to examine this person.   They all know those procedures and they have to do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well, Captain, you had a... (tape ends)</p>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> No, I did not have a look at all these entries.</p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> But you've said she had no complaints, but here is a complaint.</p>
<p class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> When I've asked her, she did not mention any complaints.   If she complained to me and at some stages she said she was tired, she wanted to have a rest, I stopped, and she said she wanted clean clothes, she obtained clean clothes.   If she said her son had to obtain money for her, I made certain arrangements.    People from Benoni summoned her son and the money was handed over in her presence.   I provided magazines for her, every small complaint I paid attention to, Mr Chairman, and if she had complained about illnesses or a heart complaint, I would have reacted to that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And do you see further on, there's another entry on the same page, on the same day, she had half an egg and she drank a glass of milk and she's not feeling well, do you see that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> I see that, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> You knew that you had to do with a person who was possibly ill, because this dossier, you had insight in this dossier?</p>
<p class="line" id="line585"><a name="pos585"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> This file was held in the charge office.   We who did the questioning had his own file.</p>
<p class="line" id="line586"><a name="pos586"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And in that, when you've questioned them regarding whether you're ill, do you need anything, and those entries were made?</p>
<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> All the entries made by the other members of the police force, I did not read, because that was for the purposes of to be used in the charge office.   If she did not complain to me, I was satisfied, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line588"><a name="pos588"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And then, further on, on page 7, at the bottom, 14:40 on the 13th of April, she starts with a request and it's said on the next page, on page 8</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line589"><a name="pos589"></a>"Tried to calm her down, she was hysterical and said if she could not contact Human, she was going to bang her head against the wall."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a>And it continues like that.   And that was ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You're asking him to comment on something that somebody else wrote down of which he's not aware.   Now how does it take this matter further?</p>
<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> With respect, Mr Chairman, this is contradictory to what he said, that there were no complaints.   This woman was hysterical.</p>
<p class="line" id="line593"><a name="pos593"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He did not say that there were no complaints, he says there were no complaints as far as he was concerned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line594"><a name="pos594"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I've said enough, but the instructions are fine, if she had any complaints, if those complaints were serious, the people in charge had to contact me or anybody else, or had to summon a doctor to pay attention toward these complaints.   If they did not do their duty, what could I have done about it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I'm putting it to you, because she was in the hand of the Security Police, how could she complain to you, because you were handling her, she was going to complain to the uniformed policemen, do you agree to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line596"><a name="pos596"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> What I don't understand, this woman at various instances told me that she was happy with her treatment.   She had her meals at the mess, she got good meals, all the section 29's had their meals in the mess, this is evidence how well they were treated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line597"><a name="pos597"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Food does not set everything right.</p>
<p class="line" id="line598"><a name="pos598"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Mr Chairman, Mrs Derby-Lewis's evidence in relation to these complaints of illness was that there was an arrangement to bring both the district surgeon and her personal physician to attend to her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line599"><a name="pos599"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> (Indistinct) to Mrs Derby-Lewis what she had to say and then what was said there was thrown away, it was re-written until you were satisfied?</p>
<p class="line" id="line600"><a name="pos600"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> This is a lie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line601"><a name="pos601"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And then furthermore you are saying did she eat in the office or in the mess?</p>
<p class="line" id="line602"><a name="pos602"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Well I know at certain instances she had her meals in the office, at certain instances she ate in the mess.   At a certain stage food was brought from the mess and she was served in the office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line603"><a name="pos603"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> As far as she can recollect, she had her meals in the kitchen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line604"><a name="pos604"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> What do you mean by the kitchen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line605"><a name="pos605"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> If the kitchen and the mess is one, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line606"><a name="pos606"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> What do you want from this question?   She got her food.   You go all the way and you are so involved in what she had to eat, this is the old style, I'm so concerned about what she had to eat, she had no reasons to complain because she was treated well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line607"><a name="pos607"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> While you were questioning her, did you tell her that Arthur Kemp had been detained?</p>
<p class="line" id="line608"><a name="pos608"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> I told her, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line609"><a name="pos609"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Why did you tell her that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line610"><a name="pos610"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Well why not?   I told her that.   I don't know what you see in that, I told her that Arthur Kemp had been detained.</p>
<p class="line" id="line611"><a name="pos611"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Please, you know that there were allegations that he had written that murder list, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line612"><a name="pos612"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line613"><a name="pos613"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That he had compiled the list?</p>
<p class="line" id="line614"><a name="pos614"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line615"><a name="pos615"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> It was an important key?</p>
<p class="line" id="line616"><a name="pos616"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That Arthur Kemp had been detained?</p>
<p class="line" id="line617"><a name="pos617"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Arthur Kemp was arrested by me personally, and I questioned him personally.</p>
<p class="line" id="line618"><a name="pos618"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you told Mrs Derby-Lewis that he's been detained?</p>
<p class="line" id="line619"><a name="pos619"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Yes, I told her that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line620"><a name="pos620"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you first spoke to Kemp and then to her, or how did it work?</p>
<p class="line" id="line621"><a name="pos621"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> After I had detained Kemp, I took his statement, and then I spoke to her.</p>
<p class="line" id="line622"><a name="pos622"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you confronted her with Kemp's information?</p>
<p class="line" id="line623"><a name="pos623"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Yes, she told me that she'd obtained a list from Kemp regarding a certain story she had to write of the people who lived in those places, and I assumed, or rather I told her exactly what he had said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line624"><a name="pos624"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And did he confirm what she had said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line625"><a name="pos625"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> He did not know what she had said.</p>
<p class="line" id="line626"><a name="pos626"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did Kemp confirm what she had said regarding the story she had to write?</p>
<p class="line" id="line627"><a name="pos627"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> I believe that Mr Kemp's statement is here, and from that we can see what he had said, I can't remember what Mr Kemp had said in his statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line628"><a name="pos628"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And then with reference to this list you've shown to her, which you'd already indicated to Deetliefs, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line629"><a name="pos629"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> What is your question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line630"><a name="pos630"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you tell her, as I can gather from your version, that Deetliefs said that she showed a murder list to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line631"><a name="pos631"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Well if she had said that, if that was explained in my statement, if you can just refer me to the specific paragraph, it was like that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line632"><a name="pos632"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> On page 4 of your statement, the fourth paragraph from the bottom, or rather the third one.</p>
<p class="line" id="line633"><a name="pos633"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> It's Colonel Van Niekerk who told me to show her that list.</p>
<p class="line" id="line634"><a name="pos634"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you tell her that Colonel Van Niekerk was not happy with her statement regarding this respect?</p>
<p class="line" id="line635"><a name="pos635"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> No, he did not say this, he just told me to show the murder list.</p>
<p class="line" id="line636"><a name="pos636"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> She's mentioned this list previously?</p>
<p class="line" id="line637"><a name="pos637"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Yes, I told her that what she had said is a contradiction of what her husband had said in his statement and what is the truth, what is the truth, what was she saying, according to her was that the truth?    She said, her version to me was that she wanted to protect Kemp and if Kemp gave his full co-operation regarding that list, she would also give her full co-operation and she would tell us what the purpose was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line638"><a name="pos638"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Where in this statement, or in any statement, did she say that she wanted to protect Kemp?</p>
<p class="line" id="line639"><a name="pos639"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> She said it somewhere in one of these statements, I've noticed it this morning.   On page 3 at the top, page 3 at the top</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line640"><a name="pos640"></a>"On that question she asked me whether Mr Kemp was still being detained.   I said no and she told me she had not spoken the truth about the list, because she did not want to cause troubles unnecessarily for Kemp, because he did not know why she wanted to obtain the addresses.   She said that she now wanted to tell the truth regarding this list, and she said, `Change this part about the list'."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line641"><a name="pos641"></a>This is what I'm referring to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line642"><a name="pos642"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And she told you, initially she said that she wanted to write stories about these people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line643"><a name="pos643"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Yes, this is also mentioned here in this statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line644"><a name="pos644"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And you've accepted that as correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line645"><a name="pos645"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Yes, I've accepted that as the truth, until I presented it to Van Niekerk and he said this was a contra-diction of her husband's statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line646"><a name="pos646"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> A contradiction regarding what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line647"><a name="pos647"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> A contradiction regarding the purpose of this list.</p>
<p class="line" id="line648"><a name="pos648"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did she mention anything regarding the purpose of the list, apart from wanting to write about it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line649"><a name="pos649"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> She said she wanted to write stories about the people.   I presented it to the commanding officer and he said, "Somebody is not telling the truth.   Take it up further with her".</p>
<p class="line" id="line650"><a name="pos650"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you do anything about the fact that she wanted to write about people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line651"><a name="pos651"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> But it seemed that she really did want to write something about those people.   Mr Chairman, what she said about the list is contained in her statement, it's mentioned in my statement, there's nothing more about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line652"><a name="pos652"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I finally want to put it to you that Mrs Derby-Lewis was never warned, according to judge's rules.   You've already answered to that.   And furthermore you told her that she would be used as a witness.   What are you saying about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line653"><a name="pos653"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Mr Chairman, an hour or two ago you said I was acting like a student constable, I was a captain in the police, I wrote my exams, I completed a three year diploma, I completed a few subjects in a legal direction at UNISA, I know what I was doing.   I warned her according judge's rules.   I have the qualifications, I have background, I knew what I was doing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line654"><a name="pos654"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And I put it to you that you've told her what to say.   I'm putting it to you that you've prescribed her and if she had legal assistance, she would have not made the statements like she did, when she was warned by Captain Louw and Captain Holmes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line655"><a name="pos655"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> According to the provisions of section 29, she was not justified to have a legal representative, that was according to the law at that time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line656"><a name="pos656"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No further questions, Your Honour.</p>
<p class="line" id="line657"><a name="pos657"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR PRINSLOO</p>
<p class="line" id="line658"><a name="pos658"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> On behalf of Mr Walus, are there ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line659"><a name="pos659"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Captain, you have just presented your qualifications to the committee, you were also a captain at that point?</p>
<p class="line" id="line660"><a name="pos660"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> That is correct, I was not a student constable.</p>
<p class="line" id="line661"><a name="pos661"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> What is noticeable to me regarding your testimony is that there was a very serious case which caused a lot of controversy nationwide, this was regarding the death of Mr Hani, and there was quite a large team of police officers involved?</p>
<p class="line" id="line662"><a name="pos662"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line663"><a name="pos663"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And there was even a number of foreign investigators who were here to assist with the investigation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line664"><a name="pos664"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Yes, there were a number who were in a monitoring capacity.</p>
<p class="line" id="line665"><a name="pos665"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> What I find interesting is that you, as a captain, and not a captain of the detectives, but a captain from the Security Branch, you arrived there and you began questioning Mrs Derby-Lewis without any background regarding her previous questionings.   Is or was anything like that ever possible?</p>
<p class="line" id="line666"><a name="pos666"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Yes, it was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line667"><a name="pos667"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Then I don't understand, I really don't know why Captain Deetliefs questioned Mrs Derby-Lewis, because then he was wasting the time and money of the State if he did not tell you or convey to you what he had found out from Mrs Derby-Lewis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line668"><a name="pos668"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Well I don't know why you're putting it to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line669"><a name="pos669"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> I would like to put it further that when the advocate representing the family of Mr Hani, there were certain statements that were made and the police who were involved, that is Colonel Van Niekerk and Captain Deetliefs and Captain Beukes were notified that they would be called as witnesses, and in terms of section 4 they sat here during the evidence with an attorney present, are you aware of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line670"><a name="pos670"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Yes, I was aware of that, I read it in the newspaper.</p>
<p class="line" id="line671"><a name="pos671"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Whether or not they were legally represented, I do not know.   So they heard the testimony of Mrs Derby-Lewis and I would like to put it to you, according to the testimony that was given here by her, that she never accused you of assaulting her in any way or inappropriately influencing her by threatening her, that was her testimony.</p>
<p class="line" id="line672"><a name="pos672"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> I am very glad to hear this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line673"><a name="pos673"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> But her testimony in fact, and this is the interesting aspect, was that she said that you told her that you would use her as a State witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line674"><a name="pos674"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> I did not say that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line675"><a name="pos675"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And that is why you took an affidavit, you told her, you must just bear in mind here that Colonel Van Niekerk is sitting here, as well as Captain Deetliefs, with their legal teams, the complaint was that if she had made a statement, then you would have taken the statement to Colonel Van Niekerk, who expressed his dissatisfaction, and then it was changed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line676"><a name="pos676"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> I delivered a long testimony regarding that issue, I said what the point was behind it, I said that we had to convey information to head office, it was quite an important case, and he, as my commanding officer, if he was not satisfied with certain aspects or clauses, would say to me, "You, as the interrogator, would have to return to her and clear up certain issues".   Could you repeat?</p>
<p class="line" id="line677"><a name="pos677"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> He did not testify.   Colonel Van Niekerk did not testify.   So he accepted that what she said did happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line678"><a name="pos678"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> I do not know the reasons why he didn't testify.</p>
<p class="line" id="line679"><a name="pos679"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Now I would like to put it to you that something must have happened, because when Mrs Derby-Lewis was arrested, and that would have been on the 21st of April 1993, that is in R4, 395, she was questioned in depth, and you know Captain Deetliefs, he is the type of person who was used by the Security Branch for this express purpose, he had very good experience, and then, on various pages, in single line space typing, she claims that when she was questioned, her answer was, unfortunately there are no notes or a video available, it continues, she is again questioned on the 24th of April, and she says, or gives her version of what happened.    Now the two important aspects here are the list and the tape, and that is what Colonel Van Niekerk was not happy with, because the police wanted her to write what they wanted her to write?</p>
<p class="line" id="line680"><a name="pos680"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line681"><a name="pos681"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Because here, where Captain Deetliefs is questioning her, it is clearly stated,</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line682"><a name="pos682"></a>"Who is being questioned by Captain Deetliefs? - Gaye Derby-Lewis".</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line683"><a name="pos683"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> That's news to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line684"><a name="pos684"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> She says that she never saw a weapon, and she continues to give her version regarding the list, why it was compiled and so forth, and then on page 202, it is on the tape on 1172, that is tape number, well the number doesn't appear here, let us just look, okay it is tape 2, she says, that is after the arrest, if one reads this in context, after the arrest of Mr Walus</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line685"><a name="pos685"></a>"Tell me where he got the gun from?"</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line686"><a name="pos686"></a>And now suddenly, my question is, suddenly she makes a completely different statement to you.   How is that possible?   </p>
<p class="line" id="line687"><a name="pos687"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> How can this lady be asking me regarding statements which a person made during another series of questioning?   I was not present, I don't know what she said at that stage.   I can only testify regarding what she said to me and what occurred between us, I cannot answer regarding questions which occurred between that captain and the lady.</p>
<p class="line" id="line688"><a name="pos688"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Why did she change her mind so suddenly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line689"><a name="pos689"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think that please, what is the point in putting questions to this witness when he wasn't present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line690"><a name="pos690"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Chairperson, I would like to know why she changed her story so suddenly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line691"><a name="pos691"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How will he know why she changed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line692"><a name="pos692"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> That is the argument, exactly.   Chair-person, this is a very serious case, and I think that the opportunity should be granted to determine exactly what happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line693"><a name="pos693"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Mr Chairman, I would like ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line694"><a name="pos694"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The speaker's microphone is not on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line695"><a name="pos695"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> ...this is not a trial, your questions have to be relevant to what he did.   What she said to others would not be something to which he's answerable, isn't it?  How can you ask him to speculate on why she said this to somebody else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line696"><a name="pos696"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> I am not asking why she said it, I am asking why she changed from one day to another and therefore changed her statement, in his hands.</p>
<p class="line" id="line697"><a name="pos697"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> How would this witness know unless you put to him the reason?</p>
<p class="line" id="line698"><a name="pos698"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> I am saying that you received instructions from Colonel Van Niekerk and you acted accordingly, and she was told to change her testimony?</p>
<p class="line" id="line699"><a name="pos699"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> She was not told to change her testimony and I have said that at various occasions on this very day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line700"><a name="pos700"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> No further questions.</p>

<p class="line" id="line704"><a name="pos704"></a>NO RE-EXAMINATION BY MR MPSHE</p>
<p class="line" id="line705"><a name="pos705"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Sorry, could I just clear up one point?</p>
<p class="line" id="line706"><a name="pos706"></a><span class="speaker">FURTHER CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR BIZOS:</span> Is it correct, it seems that on the 26th, that's on the Monday, you took her, 26th of April, you took, or you were responsible for arranging for Mrs Derby-Lewis to go to the district surgeon, where she would be seen by her own doctor?</p>
<p class="line" id="line707"><a name="pos707"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> Chairperson, the detainees at that stage were usually seen or examined by the district surgeon.   I cannot remember any other request, and whether it was therefore granted, it would have been done that way.   May I read the section please</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line708"><a name="pos708"></a>"Detainee, Mrs Derby-Lewis, taken to district surgeon's consulting rooms by Sergeant Miller from the Information Department for a medical examination by her private physicians.   She had no complaints."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line709"><a name="pos709"></a>That was not policy, that was an exceptional situation.   It just shows the preferential treatment that she received.</p>
<p class="line" id="line710"><a name="pos710"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And she returned at half past three that afternoon, it's on the next page?</p>
<p class="line" id="line711"><a name="pos711"></a><span class="speaker">MR DE WAAL:</span> That's correct.</p>

<p class="line" id="line715"><a name="pos715"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Mr Chairperson and members of the committee, the next witness is Mr Visser, who is present.   Mr Chairman, Mr Visser has indicated that he is willing to testify, but he's made an application that he testifies in camera because of threats he received in the past, as well as last night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line716"><a name="pos716"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What is the nature of these threats?</p>
<p class="line" id="line717"><a name="pos717"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Mr Chairman, my information is to the effect that he was told in the past that if he testifies at this hearing, he will be dealt with in the same fashion as the late, as it was dealt with inasfar as the late Chris Hani is concerned, and this was repeated last night, and therefore, Mr Chairperson, members of the committee ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line718"><a name="pos718"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> (Indistinct) mention his name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line719"><a name="pos719"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> ...I am therefore making that application that his evidence be heard in camera, for the reasons advanced.  I may mention that I have requested that witness protection be arranged for the witness as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line720"><a name="pos720"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes please, will you hold over.   You can go outside and sing if you wish to.   This committee is still in session.</p>
<p class="line" id="line721"><a name="pos721"></a>	The committee has the power, in appropriate cases, to hear the evidence of witness or witnesses in camera.  We haven't decided whether we are going to accede to that request.   The proper procedure is for us to be satisfied whether we should accede to that request, and in order for us to be satisfied, we will have to hear evidence on this aspect of the matter, to evaluate for ourselves how serious the threat is and so on.   For that purpose, it would be necessary to clear the hall, so that we can hear the evidence, the application rather, in camera.   If we decide that there is no need to hear the evidence in camera, you will then be allowed into the hall while the witness is giving evidence, so you are please requested to leave the hall.</p>
<p class="line" id="line722"><a name="pos722"></a>	...to be present, but I don't think she's entitled to be present, because if she is, the any other witness who's given evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line723"><a name="pos723"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Because, Mr Chairman, there are people now in the hall, like Mrs Hani, for instance, and Mr Kroenig.   He's not an attorney.</p>
<p class="line" id="line724"><a name="pos724"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I've only agreed for Mrs Hani to be present.</p>

<p class="line" id="line728"><a name="pos728"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> You've been asked to come and give evidence this morning at this hearing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line729"><a name="pos729"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line730"><a name="pos730"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And are you willing to give evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line731"><a name="pos731"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line732"><a name="pos732"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line733"><a name="pos733"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The speaker's microphone is not on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line734"><a name="pos734"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That is correct, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line735"><a name="pos735"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why it is that you wish to give evidence in camera?</p>
<p class="line" id="line736"><a name="pos736"></a>MR VISSER:  Chairperson, I can explain to the committee in a broad sense that my case began in 1993, in April 1993.   I applied for amnesty in April 1995.   During my application during 1995, the first copy of my amnesty application was faxed to Cape Town.   	With the second application, it was requested of us to hand in the original at the offices here in Johannesburg, that was on the Saturday, and on the cut-off date for the amnesty applications, me and Mr Roodt, at that stage, went to hand in our applications. </p>
<p class="line" id="line737"><a name="pos737"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The sound has been cut off, not to go to the media, so it may not go through the earphones.   Okay, I'm told the earphones can be used, I just directed they cut it, it shouldn't go out to the media.</p>
<p class="line" id="line738"><a name="pos738"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> On the Saturday, on that cut-off date for the amnesty applications, 12 o'clock midnight, Mr Roodt contacted me on the Sunday and asked me to come to his home urgently.   He told me that four persons on that particular afternoon had paid a visit to him at his home.   He could not identify them or tell me who they were, but these persons informed him that they were aware that we had applied for amnesty and they already possessed our amnesty applications.   At that point, I informed my advocate, Herman Kriel, thereof, and after that, with the first appearance in Pretoria, for which I was subpoenaed, he made it known to Mr Mpshe, and after that from time to time, as soon as the specific case would come to the fore, I would receive calls saying that I should be very careful regarding that which I would disclose, that I should not place anybody at a disadvantage, or violence would be used.  And even last night, I have told the police another call was made to me, and I feel that I cannot testify properly under these circumstances in which I have been placed, and I don't know what the objective of these calls to my home are, and that is why I'm requesting of the committee, I will, I'm willing to deliver testimony, but I would like for provision to be made that I testify in camera and that is why I'm making this request to the committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line739"><a name="pos739"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You mentioned the name of Mr Roodts, who is he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line740"><a name="pos740"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Roodt is also a person who has applied for amnesty. I do not have his relevant information, but my legal representative's advice to him was to apply for amnesty as well and his application is also being heard currently in Cape Town.</p>
<p class="line" id="line741"><a name="pos741"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Is he connected in any way with the troubles that you had?</p>
<p class="line" id="line742"><a name="pos742"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, at that stage he was in command of the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging in the West Rand, he was one of the leaders there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line743"><a name="pos743"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And the case that you talk about, when did that case commence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line744"><a name="pos744"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I can't hear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line745"><a name="pos745"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The case against you, you were talking about the case in which you're involved, when did that commence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line746"><a name="pos746"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Chairperson, it began in April 1993.</p>
<p class="line" id="line747"><a name="pos747"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When did it end?</p>
<p class="line" id="line748"><a name="pos748"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> It ended last year in October, on the 28th of October.</p>
<p class="line" id="line749"><a name="pos749"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you indicate this to the people who asked you to give evidence or who've enquired from you whether you're prepared to give evidence, that you've received threats?</p>
<p class="line" id="line750"><a name="pos750"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line751"><a name="pos751"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was that on the occasion when you were here with your Advocate Kriel?</p>
<p class="line" id="line752"><a name="pos752"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line753"><a name="pos753"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And when were these threats made for the first time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line754"><a name="pos754"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> The first time was on the Sunday after we had handed in our applications in Johannesburg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line755"><a name="pos755"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What month are you talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line756"><a name="pos756"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> April 1996.</p>
<p class="line" id="line757"><a name="pos757"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And when next was a certain threat made.</p>
<p class="line" id="line758"><a name="pos758"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> The next one was when the first hearing took place in Pretoria, that was in, I'm not sure of the dates, but I think it was last year, October.   And after that in December again and now once again.</p>
<p class="line" id="line759"><a name="pos759"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I have difficulty understanding why such a threat was made to you in April 1996?</p>
<p class="line" id="line760"><a name="pos760"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Chairperson ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line761"><a name="pos761"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That was at the time when you had lodged an application for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line762"><a name="pos762"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.   The point that I wish to make is that my amnesty application, well according to the law it is confidential, it's clearly stipulated in the law that it is confidential ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line763"><a name="pos763"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, I understand that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line764"><a name="pos764"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> ...and it fell into the hands of those who were not authorised access to it the day after these documents had been served in the TRC's offices.</p>
<p class="line" id="line765"><a name="pos765"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Any questions you wish to put?   Perhaps I'm moving a little bit ahead, but Mr Bizos, am I right in thinking that the witness is coming at your instance?</p>
<p class="line" id="line766"><a name="pos766"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman.   Perhaps I should place the following on record, that our information in relation to this witness comes from the commission drawing our attention to Exhibit Q before you, which is his application for amnesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line767"><a name="pos767"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, I'll have a look at it, but I was trying to, you know, to be able to assess, well to decide the application one must, of course, know what the relevance, possible relevance of his evidence is, how important it is before, and then one can weigh it against possible harm to himself and so on and so forth.   What I wanted to know was, the thrust of his evidence, what is the core of his evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line768"><a name="pos768"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> It appears on page 7 of his application for amnesty, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line769"><a name="pos769"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Exhibit Q.   My exhibits are so "deurmekaar".  Sorry, is there a particular page that you ...(intervention).</p>

<p class="line" id="line773"><a name="pos773"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> It's only the one page and one sentence of it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line774"><a name="pos774"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line775"><a name="pos775"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> The effect of it is, Mr Chairman ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line776"><a name="pos776"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The speaker's microphone is not on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line777"><a name="pos777"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> ...if what the witness says on page 7, is amplified whilst in consultation, it tends to show that Mr Clark, who was held out to be nothing more than a person who was interested in Mrs Derby-Lewis's computer, was involved in unlawful activities, particularly stealing large sums of money and it was suggested by Mr Clark that a portion of that money that was stolen from the JCI should be used for Mr Derby-Lewis's defence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line778"><a name="pos778"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Suggested by who?</p>
<p class="line" id="line779"><a name="pos779"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> By Mr Clark.   Now, in further consultation with the witness, further information has been made known to us about the relationship between Mr and Mrs Derby-Lewis and Mr Clark.   We would contend that if the evidence is true, then Mr Clark is most likely to have known about the plans, Mr Chairman, and we may say that Mrs Derby-Lewis' statement, sorry diary, is punctuated with Mr Clark's name at or about the time that the murder took place, and this is the basis upon which we thought the evidence relevant and it might carry the matter further.</p>
<p class="line" id="line780"><a name="pos780"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In that case, Mr Bizos, is the primary source of information not Mr Clark, assuming that we are going to have Mr Clark, I was told this morning, we were told this morning that we are likely to have Mr Clark as a witness?  Now looking at page 7, it would seem that the primary source of the information that you seek would be Mr Clark himself, and ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line781"><a name="pos781"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well, with one ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line782"><a name="pos782"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The speaker's microphone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line783"><a name="pos783"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> With one difficulty, judge, and that is this, that we have reason to believe that the friendship between Mr Clark and Mr and Mrs Derby-Lewis continues, and we do have no reason to believe that we will get any information from Mr Clark.   What we would like to put to Mr Clark is what we have been told by Mr Visser.    If that evidence is not placed on record, then it's theoretically possible to put it to Mr Clark first.   If we are correct in our assessment that he's likely to deny the allegations, then we would have to, or ask the committee to call Mr Visser in order to confirm the things that we have to put to Mr Clark, and this is why we thought that the order would be then more appropriate to have Mr Visser's evidence and then put whatever he may have said to Mr Clark.</p>
<p class="line" id="line784"><a name="pos784"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ja, you see that's the point I was trying to grapple with, because, well one must bear in mind that Mr Visser is first, I mean he's also an applicant himself, he's applying for amnesty.   If we have to hear his evidence, we'll hear it, but normally we're not very keen to hear somebody who is himself an applicant in the case, if that can be avoided, but I'm not saying that that would be one of the reasons why he shouldn't, but what I'm saying is, you want to have Mr Visser now on the premise that, well...(tape ends)</p>
<p class="line" id="line785"><a name="pos785"></a>	...to shelve Mr Visser, I'm just thinking aloud, if we were to shelve Mr Visser and then call Mr Clark, and then possibly Mr Clark does not deny these things, where perhaps you think he may, you may find no need to call Mr Visser.</p>
<p class="line" id="line786"><a name="pos786"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> That is a possibility, but ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line787"><a name="pos787"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The speaker's microphone is not on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line788"><a name="pos788"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> ...on the information that I have received, it seems to be a hypothetical and theoretical one, but if the committee feels that we should hear Mr Clark first, I have no strong objection to it.   I merely draw attention to the fact that it would only be postponing the problem rather than solving it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line789"><a name="pos789"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, I'm sure we'll bear that in mind as and when we deliberate over the application itself.   Thank you.  Is there anything you wish to say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line790"><a name="pos790"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Nothing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line791"><a name="pos791"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Nothing, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line792"><a name="pos792"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is there anything else you wish to say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line793"><a name="pos793"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line794"><a name="pos794"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry, may I ask, Mr Visser, it seems to me we had some difficulties in the past to get you here to the hearing.   Assuming that we are not to hear you today, maybe tomorrow morning, would you be available?</p>
<p class="line" id="line795"><a name="pos795"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line796"><a name="pos796"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You hear this request that is being made by this witness, or by this potential witness, and is there a view you wish to express on the matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line797"><a name="pos797"></a><span class="speaker">MRS VAN DER WALT:</span> Nothing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line798"><a name="pos798"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> (Indistinct) to hear this witness, we will make a, I have come to the conclusion, from the little bit I've heard, that Mrs Derby-Lewis should then be allowed to be present, as a result of what I have heard.   	The committee will now adjourn and make its decision known immediately after the lunch interval.</p>
<p class="line" id="line799"><a name="pos799"></a>	Mr Visser, the committee will adjourn to consider your application.   We will resume at two o'clock and we will then notify you what our decision is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line800"><a name="pos800"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line801"><a name="pos801"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The committee will adjourn and when it resumes, it will still resume in camera.</p>

<p class="line" id="line803"><a name="pos803"></a>RULING</p>
<p class="line" id="line804"><a name="pos804"></a>CHAIRPERSON:  My committee has considered the application made by Mr Visser that he be allowed to give evidence in camera, and, on the information placed before us, we have come to the conclusion that we should allow him to do so.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line805"><a name="pos805"></a>	However, he is an applicant in his own right for amnesty.   Bearing that in mind, we have come to the conclusion that his evidence here must be strictly limited to the extent that it has any direct bearing on the issues that we are seized with.   In other words, any evidence relating to other matters will be regarded as extraneous and there ought not to be any question, evidence or cross-examination of those matters.   Such questions as are put to him should be limited directly to the point for which, or the point on which he is going to give evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line806"><a name="pos806"></a>	I had, before the adjournment, indicated my personal view that Mrs Derby-Lewis may be allowed in these proceedings in camera.   My committee has considered that matter and has come to the conclusion that nobody, except for Mrs Hani, should be allowed to be present here.</p>
<p class="line" id="line807"><a name="pos807"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line808"><a name="pos808"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Perhaps I should start, Mr Visser, just a few personal details.    What are you by occupation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line809"><a name="pos809"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Sir, currently I am a transport manager for a company here in Johannesburg.</p>

<p class="line" id="line811"><a name="pos811"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I stay in Krugersdorp, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line812"><a name="pos812"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Krugersdorp.   And the questions that are going to be put to you will be confined to the issues that we are concerned with in this inquiry, do you understand?</p>
<p class="line" id="line813"><a name="pos813"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I understand, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line814"><a name="pos814"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you're expected to give us an honest and truthful and full account ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line815"><a name="pos815"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, I will.</p>
<p class="line" id="line816"><a name="pos816"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line817"><a name="pos817"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>

<p class="line" id="line819"><a name="pos819"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman, I think my learned friend, Advocate Bizos, is leading the witness.</p>

<p class="line" id="line821"><a name="pos821"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line822"><a name="pos822"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Please do so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line823"><a name="pos823"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR BIZOS:</span> Mr Visser, we are concerned only with that portion of your affidavit and application for amnesty before the committee with item No 8 on page 7, have you got that document in front of you, Exhibit Q?</p>
<p class="line" id="line824"><a name="pos824"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, yes I have the document in front of me.</p>

<blockquote class="line" id="line830"><a name="pos830"></a>"Robbery - JCI Pension Fund</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line831"><a name="pos831"></a>		A cheque to the amount of R36 900 000,00.   Account opened by Colonel Roodt.   Clark provided the cheque and received it from a person working at JCI.   This fund originally was intended for the Volksfront to purchase two-way radios and that was decided to use that for the legal costs of Derby-Lewis.   I personally was against Mr Hani's murder, because we had information that Hani and Mandela wanted to establish a party.   I reported that to Roodt, and Roodt took control of this operation and saw to it that this would not go to Clark.   This cheque was banked on the 3rd of March 1993.   Hani was murdered on the 10th of April 1993.   I and Roodt came to hear of the murder on the 10th of April 1993.   There was no conspiracy with the AWB, the Volksfront, to murder Mr Hani.   We suspect that Mr Clive Derby-Lewis himself orchestrated this attack on Mr Hani."</p>
<p class="line" id="line832"><a name="pos832"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Have you had any training in the police force or any such body, Mr Visser?</p>
<p class="line" id="line833"><a name="pos833"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I can't hear that question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line834"><a name="pos834"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Have you had any training in the police force?</p>
<p class="line" id="line835"><a name="pos835"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, I have.</p>
<p class="line" id="line836"><a name="pos836"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> For when were you in the police force?</p>
<p class="line" id="line837"><a name="pos837"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I was in the police force from 1980 - sorry, from 1977 until 1986.</p>
<p class="line" id="line838"><a name="pos838"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> What rank did you reach?</p>
<p class="line" id="line839"><a name="pos839"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I was a detective-sergeant.</p>
<p class="line" id="line840"><a name="pos840"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Were you in any particular branch?</p>
<p class="line" id="line841"><a name="pos841"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I was first, my first few years I was in the police Dog Unit, then Commercial Branch and then later, the latter part of the police force, before I left, I was a member of the Security Police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line842"><a name="pos842"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And you mentioned the name of Mr Roodt.   Who was Mr Roodt?</p>
<p class="line" id="line843"><a name="pos843"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Roodt was a commandant of the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging, he was one of the leaders, at that stage, prior to the elections in April 1994, of certain cells in the West Rand, Krugersdorp, Roodeport, Western Area sections.</p>
<p class="line" id="line844"><a name="pos844"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> How do you know that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line845"><a name="pos845"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Because I was also a member under him at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line846"><a name="pos846"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Were you a member in '83 - I beg your pardon, '93?</p>
<p class="line" id="line847"><a name="pos847"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That's correct, I was a member in 1993.</p>
<p class="line" id="line848"><a name="pos848"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And you mentioned the name of Mr Clark.   Have you seen Mr Clark here today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line849"><a name="pos849"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, just briefly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line850"><a name="pos850"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Is that Mr Edwin Clark?</p>
<p class="line" id="line851"><a name="pos851"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line852"><a name="pos852"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And how did you come to know him and what dealings, if any, did you have with him during '/93?</p>
<p class="line" id="line853"><a name="pos853"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I met Mr Clark, I cannot say approximately when, it must have been in early 1992, Mr Clark wrote certain computer programmes for my business at that stage, and that is how I got acquainted with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line854"><a name="pos854"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Did you discuss political or other activities with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line855"><a name="pos855"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I would say in the period of the beginning when I met him, I was not very much, reluctant to get involved with the political situation.   I must admit that during the latter part of 1992, Mr Clark influenced me to join the right wing.   At that stage, the right wing was in a bit of a turmoil regarding all the different organisations that took part in the so-called struggle at that stage.   So therefore we joined as many of these organisations as possible, in the hope of being brought into one arm and at that stage when General Constand Viljoen took over the management of these systems and we obviously, also as an ex-military person, I joined under him also.</p>
<p class="line" id="line856"><a name="pos856"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> What was your function in this right wing thing that you were involved with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line857"><a name="pos857"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Basically, in the beginning, due to my experience from the police, I did a lot of information gathering.   Fortunately at that stage I still had a lot of my ex-informers from the Security Police days who advised us on certain information that we needed on the African National Congress, the South African Communist Party, so our information that we got from them were then evaluated, sifted and then tested, and then if necessary we passed it on to the correct persons in the structure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line858"><a name="pos858"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> During 1983, you and Mr Clark and Mr Roodt and other persons, were you involved in ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line859"><a name="pos859"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> '93.</p>

<p class="line" id="line861"><a name="pos861"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> '93.</p>
<p class="line" id="line862"><a name="pos862"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> During '93, were you, Mr Clark, Mr Roodt and others concerned with getting money?</p>
<p class="line" id="line863"><a name="pos863"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, at that stage we were advised through the structures that certain actions would be taking place from the evening of the election, 1994, and we were advised to start a building up of arms and ammunition, the purchase of two-way radios, the setting up of structures, collecting information on military armaments, and if necessary, to collect funds on any possible way that the funds could be raised to buy these arms, ammunition, and for the object of preparing for an armed struggle in this country on the evening of the election, April 1994.</p>
<p class="line" id="line864"><a name="pos864"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And was money collected by unlawful means?</p>
<p class="line" id="line865"><a name="pos865"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, in certain cases, yes, they were obtained, and indeed explosives were bought and these explosives were sent down into the structures.</p>
<p class="line" id="line866"><a name="pos866"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Did you, Mr Clark and Mr Roodt have anything to do with that, with the collecting of money, or stealing of money?</p>
<p class="line" id="line867"><a name="pos867"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Not indirectly, directly yes, we took part in the initial meetings that we had, certain persons were used.  Referring to the cheque of JCI, Mr Clark obtained this cheque through a, I'm not sure of the person's name, I might be wrong there, by the name of Dillis, from JCI Pension Fund.   Initially this cheque would have been used for the purchase of two-way radios for the cause.   As I've said in my paragraph 8, that this cheque was banked on the 30th of March, prior to the murder of Mr Hani, and I must also just make a small correction here, is that at that stage that we were not aware of the fact that there was such an action going to take place.    Nowhere in the structure, especially on the side of Constand Viljoen, were we aware that such an action are going to take place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line868"><a name="pos868"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> You say that this cheque, do you know who it was made out to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line869"><a name="pos869"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> The cheque, I'm not sure, I can't remember if it was a cheque made out to a Mr Goldman, I think, I'm not sure, I'm not 100% correct now if I do mention a name, but it was made out to somebody.</p>
<p class="line" id="line870"><a name="pos870"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> But who actually took it and made use of it in order to get the money?</p>
<p class="line" id="line871"><a name="pos871"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> At that stage, Commandant Roodt went, he opened the account and the cheque was then deposited into the account.</p>
<p class="line" id="line872"><a name="pos872"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And what happened to the money?</p>
<p class="line" id="line873"><a name="pos873"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> After, in that period between the 30th of March to the 10th of April, it was the Easter weekend and I went on holiday for that period, because we have already booked a caravan stand at Badplaas in the Eastern Transvaal.    I was actually, the evening of the 10th of April, I heard it on the radio that Mr Hani was shot.</p>
<p class="line" id="line874"><a name="pos874"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And did you discuss this with Commandant Roodt and with Mr Clark?</p>
<p class="line" id="line875"><a name="pos875"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> At that stage, I immediately phoned Commandant Roodt to inquire from him whether he was aware of this, because at that stage, as I've said earlier on that we were not aware of it, that any such action would take place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line876"><a name="pos876"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And what did Commandant Roodt say to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line877"><a name="pos877"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> He was very surprised himself at that stage that it happened, and I said to him that I would phone him back, because it's quite difficult to leave messages where we were at Badplaas, so I phoned him back at a later stage, and at that stage he advised me that Mr Clark was arrested and that, I think he was detained, what I can remember, for 48 hours, and then he was released, and after his release, he asked Commandant Roodt to draw the money for the use for Mr Clive Derby-Lewis's legal fees at that stage, and with consultation with me and Commandant Roodt, I said to Commandant Roodt that we should not allow it, because strictly there was not such an instruction from either General Constand Viljoen, General Tienie Groenewald, and that we should not get involved with this matter before we could establish where does the instructions come from.</p>
<p class="line" id="line878"><a name="pos878"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Did you eventually speak to Mr Clark about this matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line879"><a name="pos879"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I spoke to Mr Clark after our return from holiday, and at that stage, what I can still remember is that he didn't tell me anything regrading any meetings that he had regarding, or that he was implicated himself.   All that he told me at that stage is that he was arrested, he was detained, he was questioned, and that was it.   He didn't convey to me any implication or any hint that he was involved with this whole operation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line880"><a name="pos880"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Did you talk to him about his request to Mr Roodt for the money to be used?</p>
<p class="line" id="line881"><a name="pos881"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.   He actually asked me that, at one stage, that he wanted to go and draw the money on behalf of Mr Roodt, so I said to him, "Look, the cheque has already been banked", as I said in my application, "on the 30th of March", and if you look at the normal banking procedure, a cheque is cleared within seven days, and by now the people in question, or the holder of the cheque would surely have advised the company that he did not receive the cheque and that it will be a very dangerous, it would put himself into great danger to go to the bank and draw the money, because the cheque would have been, it's very much possible, because it took such a long time for them to make a decision to that point to withdraw the money.</p>
<p class="line" id="line882"><a name="pos882"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Did he ask you to be of any assistance in relation to getting the money?</p>
<p class="line" id="line883"><a name="pos883"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, as I've said earlier on, there was meetings that we had prior to, I would say in January of '93, January, February, March, there were a lot of the people involved in the right wing at that stage that needed arms and ammunition.   We were also instructed from the people in charge of these and even in meetings with General Constand Viljoen, open meetings, where they openly stated that we should arm ourselves and even prepare for food shortages, as electrical cuts and that type of thing can and might be occurred at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line884"><a name="pos884"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Did Mr Clark ask you to try and persuade Mr Roodt to get money, to get the money for Mr Derby-Lewis's defence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line885"><a name="pos885"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> As I can remember, he did, but I think at that stage Mr Roodt was adamant that the money will not be used and it must be left where it was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line886"><a name="pos886"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Did he give you any reason why he wanted the money to be used for Mr Derby-Lewis's defence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line887"><a name="pos887"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No, he didn't gave me any reason why.   He only said that he wanted it at that stage, wanted to use the money for his legal fees.</p>
<p class="line" id="line888"><a name="pos888"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Did you ask him why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line889"><a name="pos889"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No, I didn't ask him why.</p>
<p class="line" id="line890"><a name="pos890"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> In your conversations with Mr Clark about this matter, did he appear to you to be forthcoming and open, or was he answering your questions quickly and fairly, or did he try to avoid your questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line891"><a name="pos891"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I would say Mr Clark, at that stage, as a result that he was more involved with the right wing, he, in certain aspects he never conveyed to me, I would say more, if I would say important matters, he never conveyed that to me, and I've learnt him to be such a person that if you would ask him a question then he wouldn't tell you.   I respected his viewpoint, and certain aspects I did sometimes ask him and he would say to me, no, it's classified, it's  top secret and he cannot divulge any information to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line892"><a name="pos892"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> In this structure, this right wing structure that you speak of, was there a ranking, and if so, who was, among the three of you, who was the top man, so to speak?</p>
<p class="line" id="line893"><a name="pos893"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I would say from the, regarding ranks, in the AWB, yes there were ranks there, at that stage, in the West Rand, regarding the Freedom Front and the Volksfront, there was not, at that stage, as I can remember, there was not specific structures, but I would say that, regarding seniority and regarding classified information, I would Mr Clark was my senior.</p>
<p class="line" id="line894"><a name="pos894"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And where did Mr Roodt fit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line895"><a name="pos895"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Roodt fitted in, from the AWB side, he was, as I said earlier on, he was the commandant of certain of the cells in the West Rand.   Why the cell structure, is that at that stage the Security Police used to frequently infiltrate into the activities of the AWB, and that was the reason, I can remember back on a meeting with, that we had in Ventersdorp with Mr Eugene Terreblanche, that he advised us that we start a cell structure to prevent any infiltration from the Security Police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line896"><a name="pos896"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Did you ask Mr Clark what was the basis of his friendship between himself, on the one hand, and Mr and Mrs Derby-Lewis on the other?</p>
<p class="line" id="line897"><a name="pos897"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I never asked him, I was aware at that stage that he would visit Mr Clive Derby-Lewis and Mrs Clive Derby-Lewis, he used to often tell me that he was preparing their VC's and he would go and eat there and they would invite him over and that's basically all I knew about their friendship.   I never asked him why was he friends with them.   Obviously at that stage Mr Clive Derby-Lewis was a member of the CP, he was one of the leaders of the CP, so I assumed, due to the structure that Mr Clark was in in the area that he operated that, and due to the background of the political events in that time, that it was important for him to be associated with Mr Clive Derby-Lewis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line898"><a name="pos898"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Was Radio Pretoria or information gathering mentioned in any way in relation to Mr and Mrs Derby-Lewis on the one hand and Mr Clark on the other?</p>
<p class="line" id="line899"><a name="pos899"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, I remember on quite a few occasions that he had to go through to Radio Pretoria to repair, I think at one stage he had written a computer programme for them, and that's what I can remember from that time at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line900"><a name="pos900"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Did Mr Clark ever tell you, after his release from arrest, what was in his computer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line901"><a name="pos901"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No, he only told me that, after his arrest, that they did confiscate his computer and that they tried to, how can I say, the computer language that he brought up, they tried to brought up the information from the hard disks, but they were not successful, I think he told me at that stage that the sergeant in charge of this operation didn't had so much technical knowledge to bring up the information on his computer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line902"><a name="pos902"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Did he tell you what might have been his position if the police did have sufficient knowledge to unlock the information in his computer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line903"><a name="pos903"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Ja, he did tell me that he would have been in quite, he could have been in trouble if they brought it up.  I didn't ask him at that stage what information he had on the computer.   If it was linked to the Hani matter I cannot say, as he didn't tell me at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line904"><a name="pos904"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Thank you, Mr Chairman, I have no further questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line905"><a name="pos905"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR BIZOS</p>
<p class="line" id="line906"><a name="pos906"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> May I put my questions first?</p>
<p class="line" id="line907"><a name="pos907"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Mr Visser, you have said that you were involved with right wing groups.   To which groups are you referring?</p>
<p class="line" id="line908"><a name="pos908"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I am referring to the Freedom Front, the AWB and the Freedom Front.</p>
<p class="line" id="line909"><a name="pos909"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And the period of time when you were involved, when did it begin?</p>
<p class="line" id="line910"><a name="pos910"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I began with them in, or actively, from I would say January 1993, yet passively I would say from about June, July 1992.</p>
<p class="line" id="line911"><a name="pos911"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> The Freedom Front was established in March 1995?</p>
<p class="line" id="line912"><a name="pos912"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line913"><a name="pos913"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And you have said, or you've spoken of "we", I am not clear on who you are referring to, is this the Goldman to whom the cheque was made out, was that one of your people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line914"><a name="pos914"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No.   As far as I could understand, Mr Clark said to me that the cheque, and I only found this out subsequently, after the police had visited me, that allegedly it was pension money which was paid out to this person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line915"><a name="pos915"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> But Mr Roodt, the commander, he used the name of Helgut when he used those cheques.</p>
<p class="line" id="line916"><a name="pos916"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That is the cheque.</p>
<p class="line" id="line917"><a name="pos917"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> So Mr Roodt made, frauded the cheque, he filled in his name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line918"><a name="pos918"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No, as I can recall, Mr Chairman, the cheque was in the name of Calcott, I'm just ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line919"><a name="pos919"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Calcroft?</p>
<p class="line" id="line920"><a name="pos920"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Calcott, that was the correct name.   Earlier on, I did mention another name, I wasn't sure, but it was the cheque of Calcott.   Mr Chairman, Mr Roodt took the cheque with a forged ID document in the name of Calcott, and then the cheque account was, I mean an account was opened at Standard Bank, Rosebank, and the cheque was then deposited into that account.</p>
<p class="line" id="line921"><a name="pos921"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> You referred to a matter where Mr Edwin Clark would have gone to Radio Pretoria?</p>
<p class="line" id="line922"><a name="pos922"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line923"><a name="pos923"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> In which year was this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line924"><a name="pos924"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I cannot say which period of time this took place in, but I knew that he sometimes went there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line925"><a name="pos925"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> So there was nothing strange about the fact that he was going to Radio Pretoria?</p>
<p class="line" id="line926"><a name="pos926"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No, not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line927"><a name="pos927"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> You have said that Mr Edwin Clark worked for the accounts of Mr and Mrs Derby-Lewis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line928"><a name="pos928"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I wouldn't say both, I wouldn't say that he worked with both of their computers, he just said that he was going to work with their computers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line929"><a name="pos929"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Mr Edwin Clark is a computer expert, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line930"><a name="pos930"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line931"><a name="pos931"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> He also presents classes in computers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line932"><a name="pos932"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line933"><a name="pos933"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And the hard disk which you mentioned, where the police could not find all the information, you would not be able to argue that in the case of Mr Derby-Lewis in the supreme court in Johannesburg, police officers testified, who were computer experts, who pointed out all the information on the hard disk, and it was all in the hands of the police, you cannot argue that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line934"><a name="pos934"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Let me put it this way, I think in the case of Mr Clark, he told me clearly that they could not life his information.</p>
<p class="line" id="line935"><a name="pos935"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> But there were experts who could retrieve all the information?</p>
<p class="line" id="line936"><a name="pos936"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I would say so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line937"><a name="pos937"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> No further questions, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line938"><a name="pos938"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS VAN DER WALT</p>
<p class="line" id="line939"><a name="pos939"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR PRINSLOO:</span> Mr Visser, if I</p>
<p class="line" id="line940"><a name="pos940"></a>understand your testimony correctly, you only contacted Mr Roodt after the 10th of April when you had come back from ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line941"><a name="pos941"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No, I phoned him that evening after the news flash on the radio, and I was quite surprised, it was a prominent figure, I also, from the Security Police days, read a lot of information on Mr Hani, I knew who Mr Hani was, and I was quite shocked, I was really shocked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line942"><a name="pos942"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Mr Visser, you know that Mr Derby-Lewis was arrested only on the 17th of April?,</p>
<p class="line" id="line943"><a name="pos943"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> He was arrested on the 17th of April, that's correct, I am aware of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line944"><a name="pos944"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And Mrs Derby-Lewis on the 21st of April?</p>
<p class="line" id="line945"><a name="pos945"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, I am aware of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line946"><a name="pos946"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And at that point, there was no mention of a cheque for the payment of the legal, because they had not been arrested yet?</p>
<p class="line" id="line947"><a name="pos947"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> At that point, I might be confusing my times, I remember, after I was arrested, or at least not arrested, but after I was approached by the police regarding the cheque, it could have been that I may have given my dates and times incorrectly, because Mr Clark, at that point, asked that we use the cheque for Mr Derby-Lewis's legal costs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line948"><a name="pos948"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> But you said that this only came to the fore after Mr Derby-Lewis's arrest?</p>
<p class="line" id="line949"><a name="pos949"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.   At that point he might have spoken to Mr Roodt.</p>
<p class="line" id="line950"><a name="pos950"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That is after his arrest and his release?</p>
<p class="line" id="line951"><a name="pos951"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line952"><a name="pos952"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Mr Clark was arrested only after Mr and Mrs Derby-Lewis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line953"><a name="pos953"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I cannot respond to that, I don't remember specifically.   As I understood it, Mr Clark, I cannot remember whether or not he was arrested before or after them, or at which point, that I cannot remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line954"><a name="pos954"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> So therefore Mr Clark, if he approached you, must have done so in his own capacity?   If Mr Clark had approached you, it would have been in his own capacity, because Mr Derby-Lewis, as well as Mrs Derby-Lewis were detained in terms of section 29?</p>
<p class="line" id="line955"><a name="pos955"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I am aware of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line956"><a name="pos956"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And you know what that means, they had no access to anyone, so Mr Derby-Lewis could not have made the request?</p>
<p class="line" id="line957"><a name="pos957"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line958"><a name="pos958"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Just one moment please?   Just to understand it correctly, on the 30th of March, there was no talk of legal costs for Mr Derby-Lewis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line959"><a name="pos959"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line960"><a name="pos960"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And you are aware that the legal costs of Mr Derby-Lewis and his wife were paid by the Conservative Party, do you know about that? --- Yes, I was aware thereof and that is what I said to Mr Clark at that point, that I was aware that a fund had been established, I don't recall whether it was with Volkskas Bank or with another bank, but there was an account number which was published in the press and donations could be deposited into that account and it's at that point that I said to Mr Clark from my side that I would encourage him not to apply those funds, because of individuals who thought much of Mr Derby-Lewis and I'm sure they would have made a number of donations and facilitated the payment of his legal costs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line961"><a name="pos961"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Just one moment please?   Because of the noise, I would just like to re-establish something, the Freedom Front was established in May 1993, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line962"><a name="pos962"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> I cannot remember exactly when the Freedom Front was established, that I cannot remember, it must have been -General Constand Viljoen's party was established on the evening of the election, that was in 1994.</p>
<p class="line" id="line963"><a name="pos963"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I put it to you that Mrs Derby-Lewis and Mr Derby-Lewis gave no orders to anyone to use this fund that you were speaking of.   Do you have any comment?</p>
<p class="line" id="line964"><a name="pos964"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> All I can say, and I would just like to rectify something, I have never met Mr Derby-Lewis or his wife in person.   There was talk of the application of the funds for Mr Derby-Lewis, I have not knowledge of that and so does Mr Roodt, but as I have said in my testimony, our order was that the funds not be used for that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line965"><a name="pos965"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Personally you did not deposit the cheque, the stolen cheque?</p>
<p class="line" id="line966"><a name="pos966"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> No.   And that is the reason why I have applied for amnesty, not because or for the deposit of the cheque, I was charged with the theft of the cheque, and at that point, I said that, I went to my peers and I said, "I am being charged with this and you need to sort this out, because otherwise I will have no other alternative but to apply for amnesty", in other words I would go to the authorities and tell them, "Look, this is what happened", and I did so, I went to Mr Clark before April 19..., before I submitted my application, I went to all the interested parties and told them what the situation was and what I was going to do, and that is what I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line967"><a name="pos967"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Just a moment please?   Mr Visser, I think that</p>
<p class="line" id="line968"><a name="pos968"></a>you are making a mistake with your dates if you say that you became involved with the Freedom Front in 1993, because this organisation didn't exist then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line969"><a name="pos969"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, I might be making a mistake with the dates, because I submitted my application approximately four years after this incident occurred, and I also put it like this to the amnesty committee in Cape Town, by means of my attorney, that if there would be some lack of clarity or if there would be any kind of queries regarding this aspect, we would rectify it with the greatest willingness, because I might make a mistake with certain aspects, but that I entered the struggle at that stage, was passively in the middle of 1993, and then more actively afterwards.</p>
<p class="line" id="line970"><a name="pos970"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Didn't you say passively in the middle of 1992?</p>
<p class="line" id="line971"><a name="pos971"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes, I did say that, Mr ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line972"><a name="pos972"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> But you just said now 1993?</p>
<p class="line" id="line973"><a name="pos973"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Actively 1993, Mr Chairman.</p>

<p class="line" id="line975"><a name="pos975"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> May I just ask two questions in relation to place the events in time space, two questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line976"><a name="pos976"></a><span class="speaker">RE-EXAMINATION BY MR BIZOS:</span> When did you see Mr Clark about you applying for amnesty and you felt a duty to inform him, when did you do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line977"><a name="pos977"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Mr Chairman, that was, if I can recall back, it was, I would say in about two to three weeks before I lodged my application.</p>

<p class="line" id="line979"><a name="pos979"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line980"><a name="pos980"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> ...I think that's enough.   The other thing is this, the struggle that you became passively involved in and the struggle that you became actively involved in, was your association with what is called...  (tape ends)</p>

<p class="line" id="line982"><a name="pos982"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> It was before that, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line983"><a name="pos983"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> So that before General Viljoen made any statement about the Freedom Front, you had been involved in these activities?</p>
<p class="line" id="line984"><a name="pos984"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.   Yes, I was involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line985"><a name="pos985"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Both actively and passively?</p>
<p class="line" id="line986"><a name="pos986"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> Yes.</p>

<p class="line" id="line989"><a name="pos989"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Just two questions, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line990"><a name="pos990"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MPSHE:</span> Mr Visser, you testified that you collected ammunition to prepare for the struggle?</p>

<p class="line" id="line992"><a name="pos992"></a><span class="speaker">MR MPSHE:</span> Now in what way was this ammunition to be used, did you have particular targets?</p>
<p class="line" id="line993"><a name="pos993"></a><span class="speaker">MR VISSER:</span> The instruction at that stage were that, from General Constand Viljoen, and it's also part of his amnesty application, is that on the evening of the election of April 1994, the instructions were clear that at that stage that the voting locals must be bombed, electrical power lines must be sabotaged, all roads towards the election voting stations must be possible be closed, also the, if the command was given, that the police stations must be attacked, command structures at that stage that were already in place would then operate from those places, and basically the country would have been brought into a state of war.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1005"><a name="pos1005"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Unless there are any other applications for the hearing of evidence in camera, I propose to allow the public in to the hearing.   Before I take an adjournment to enable that to be done, are you calling any further witnesses?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1006"><a name="pos1006"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes, we would ask that Mr Clark be called, Mr Chairman.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1008"><a name="pos1008"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.   To try and save some time, can you send a message to whoever controls the doors that they may open them? CHAIRPERSON:  Penny's going to do that?   Very well, let's proceed with the next witness then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1009"><a name="pos1009"></a><span class="speaker">EDWIN JOHN CLARK:</span> (affirms to speak truth)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1010"><a name="pos1010"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MR BIZOS:</span> Where do you live, Mr Clark?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1011"><a name="pos1011"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> I live in Pretoria, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1012"><a name="pos1012"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Is today the first day on which you've come to a hearing of this committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1013"><a name="pos1013"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> No sir, I have been here on a number of occasions previously.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1014"><a name="pos1014"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> When you knew that the counsel for the commission and the families' attorneys were looking for you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1015"><a name="pos1015"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> That's correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1016"><a name="pos1016"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Why didn't you volunteer to the counsel for the commission that you were at the commission and taking photographs and taking a vital interest in the proceedings, why didn't you do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1017"><a name="pos1017"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> I beg your pardon, would you repeat the question please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1018"><a name="pos1018"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Why didn't you, if you knew that counsel for the commission and the attorneys for the family were looking for you, why did you surreptitiously come to the meetings of the committee and not identify yourself to counsel for the commission?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1019"><a name="pos1019"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> That's not correct, Mr Chairman, from the time I became aware that you were looking for me, I simply stayed away.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1020"><a name="pos1020"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1021"><a name="pos1021"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Because I did not wish to testify, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1022"><a name="pos1022"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1023"><a name="pos1023"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Mr Chairman, I have a moral problem with the functioning of the TRC, that is the truth of the matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1024"><a name="pos1024"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Oh.   And what made you change your mind?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1025"><a name="pos1025"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> I got a request from certain people to appear over here, people whose wishes I respect, and on the basis of that request, I decided to come.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1026"><a name="pos1026"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Who requested you to come and on whose behalf did you change your mind about the commission?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1027"><a name="pos1027"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> The legal counsel for Mr Derby-Lewis sent me a request that I do appear, I got this request yesterday afternoon, and on their request I will do it with pleasure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1028"><a name="pos1028"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Weren't you in constant contact with Mr and Mrs Derby-Lewis ever since these proceedings started in May, I beg your pardon, last year in Benoni?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1029"><a name="pos1029"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Constant contact, no sir, I stay quite far away from them.   There was occasional contact however.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1030"><a name="pos1030"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Didn't Mrs Derby-Lewis tell you right at the beginning of the hearing in Mamelodi that you were required by the family in order to give evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1031"><a name="pos1031"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> A number of people informed me of this, I cannot remember whether Mrs Derby-Lewis specifically told me or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1032"><a name="pos1032"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Did you come to Mamelodi?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1033"><a name="pos1033"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> I did not, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1034"><a name="pos1034"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Did you come to Johannesburg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1035"><a name="pos1035"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Before today, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1036"><a name="pos1036"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> When did you then attend meetings of the committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1037"><a name="pos1037"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> It was in Pretoria Town Hall, which is close to where I live.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1038"><a name="pos1038"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Did you know at that time that your name had been mentioned and that Mrs Derby-Lewis said that she could get through to you with some difficulty on some plot or other?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1039"><a name="pos1039"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> No sir, that was before that time.   In Pretoria, I would sit in the audience and you mentioned my name on occasion.   At that point, you did not require my presence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1040"><a name="pos1040"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> When did you hear that counsel for the commission was leaving messages for you all over the place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1041"><a name="pos1041"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> I got various messages all over the place, Mr Chairman, I cannot remember the exact dates, but when you were looking for me, the odds are that shortly thereafter I received your message.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1042"><a name="pos1042"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr , will you get down to the purpose of the questioning instead of ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1043"><a name="pos1043"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.   Did you ask the previous witness, or rather did the previous witness ask you or tell you that he was applying for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1044"><a name="pos1044"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> You are referring now to Mr Visser?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1045"><a name="pos1045"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1046"><a name="pos1046"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Yes, he did tell me he was going to apply for amnesty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1047"><a name="pos1047"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Did he tell you what for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1048"><a name="pos1048"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Yes he did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1049"><a name="pos1049"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> What did he tell you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1050"><a name="pos1050"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> It's a long time ago.   What I do remember is that he wanted to apply for amnesty.   I do remember him telling me that he'd been found guilty on various charges and that he wanted to apply for amnesty because they were politically motivated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1051"><a name="pos1051"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And why was this a concern of yours?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1052"><a name="pos1052"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> I don't know why he should have made it a concern of mine at the time.   Prior to that, we had dealings with one another, I was doing computer work for him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1053"><a name="pos1053"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Is that all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1054"><a name="pos1054"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> That is all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1055"><a name="pos1055"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> That would not have been any reason for him to come and tell you that he was applying for amnesty?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1056"><a name="pos1056"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> We discussed many things and many things political.   I have been involved in a minor capacity in the political field for many years, I have an interest in this, and he did come and discuss this with me.   He approached me at that time and he wanted me to apply for amnesty as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1057"><a name="pos1057"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> For what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1058"><a name="pos1058"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> He wanted me to try and cover up for him, and I told him I was not interested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1059"><a name="pos1059"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Cover up for what?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1060"><a name="pos1060"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> He wanted me to say that I had done certain acts.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1061"><a name="pos1061"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> What acts?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1062"><a name="pos1062"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Stealing cheques I don't know.   He gave me a, he showed me various things on a paper, and I told him I'm not interested in that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1063"><a name="pos1063"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Mr Clark, the previous witness told us that you, he and Mr Roodt were involved in stealing money and gathering arms in preparation for a state of war that you expected to start.   Is that evidence incorrect?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1064"><a name="pos1064"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Let me answer you this way, you've mentioned a few things in the same breath, that I was in any way doing anything with Mr Visser as regarding any sort of fraudulent activities, that is incorrect.   The same goes for Mr Roodt, whom I do know, I was involved in no way with any fraudulent activities with him.   As regards the two, any dealings with arms is also incorrect.   As regards anything else to do with arms, I'm not prepared to state.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1065"><a name="pos1065"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Let me see if I understand you correctly, that in respect of arms gathering, you do not want to incriminate yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1066"><a name="pos1066"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> You could see it that way, Mr Chairman, I'm not prepared to make any statement as regards arms gathering, except to say that as regards Mr Visser, and as regards Mr Roodt, the statement is 100% incorrect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1067"><a name="pos1067"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well, he told us that you had knowledge of the theft of R369 082,56 from JCI, which was put into an account by Mr Roodt, did you know that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1068"><a name="pos1068"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Mr Chairman, I did not know that, I cannot see how I could possibly have had knowledge about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1069"><a name="pos1069"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And it was further said that you asked him to divert that money from, for the purpose of collecting arms and two-way radios to be used for the then ensuing war, and diverted to the defence of Mr and Mrs Derby-Lewis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1070"><a name="pos1070"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Mr Chairman, I don't know whether my record is wrong, but it's never been mentioned that this money was meant for weapons, it was meant for two-way radios for the Volksfront, but not for weapons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1071"><a name="pos1071"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Your understanding is right, he didn't mention weapons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1072"><a name="pos1072"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Two-way radios for the struggle, yes, for the struggle, for the struggle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1073"><a name="pos1073"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1074"><a name="pos1074"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well, what do you say to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1075"><a name="pos1075"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Mr Chairman, as regards the Volksfront, I was a member in those days, as you correctly state there was an undeclared war ensuing, however I have never collaborated with Mr Visser or Mr Roodt on buying any two-way radios or buying any arms or ammunition, whether from any fraudulently gained money or any other way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1076"><a name="pos1076"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Now, the gravamen of the question was not what the money was going to be used for, the gravamen of the question, Mr Clark, was that you suggested that that money should be used for the defence of Mr and Mr Derby-Lewis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1077"><a name="pos1077"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Mr Chairman, I have seen this accusation, I have also had a look at various dates concerned, and I fail to see how it is possible, because that cheque is supposed to have been stolen even before Mr Hani was shot, that's my understanding.   So how I can ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1078"><a name="pos1078"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think the first question you put to him hasn't even been answered, you see, have you any knowledge in the first place of the fact that money had been stolen and fraudulently deposited into an account by Mr Roodt?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1079"><a name="pos1079"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> No knowledge whatsoever, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1080"><a name="pos1080"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You didn't have any knowledge of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1081"><a name="pos1081"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> None.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1082"><a name="pos1082"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Did you try to persuade Mr Roodt to use any money that had been collected in that structure that you and he were working on ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1083"><a name="pos1083"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1084"><a name="pos1084"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> ...for the purposes of Mr Derby-Lewis's defence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1085"><a name="pos1085"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> No sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1086"><a name="pos1086"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Did you interest yourself at all at any time in relation to the financing of the Derby-Lewis defence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1087"><a name="pos1087"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Not at all.   When Mr Derby-Lewis was arrested, it was a matter of concern for us, but legal expenses were not even an issue at that stage, because he was held under section 29, he was not even allowed access to a lawyer, so for quite a long time the legal issue could not have existed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1088"><a name="pos1088"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well you seem to be familiar with the ways of these matters, Mr Clark, did you expect him to be under section 29 for a long time, or to remain there forever and never to be brought before a Court?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1089"><a name="pos1089"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Mr Chairman, the notorious section 29 Act makes allowance that you can extend it again and again and again.  I have acquaintances who were held for a long time under this Act, in one case three months, and I cannot say what I expected at that time, except that for him to be released after ten days would have been a miracle indeed, I did not expect that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1090"><a name="pos1090"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> You didn't know that the Act had been amended, and that judicial intervention had to come into being after ten days?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1091"><a name="pos1091"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Mr Chairman, I'm not a legal expert.    To my knowledge the Act was amended in some such way that you could extend it after ten days for another ten days, but the minister could refuse at ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1092"><a name="pos1092"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Not the minister, the Court.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1093"><a name="pos1093"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Let me not express an opinion then, sir, I don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1094"><a name="pos1094"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.   But be that as it may, whether it was going to be ten days or 20 days or a month, were you concerned about the defence of the Derby-Lewis's?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1095"><a name="pos1095"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> When finally it became an issue, obviously yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1096"><a name="pos1096"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> When did you join the structure that you call the Freedom Front?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1097"><a name="pos1097"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Mr Chairman, in the newspapers I've been accused of being a member of the Freedom Front quite a number of times, and this has caused me no little amount of distress.  I have in my hands a letter from the Freedom Front, which I would like to read</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1098"><a name="pos1098"></a>"Hereby it is certified that Mr J E Clark and J Visser, residing in Gauteng, are not members of the Freedom Front and had never been members of the Freedom Front.</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1099"><a name="pos1099"></a>		For Colonel P D Uys from the Freedom Front"</p>
<p class="line" id="line1100"><a name="pos1100"></a>Could we have someone please to send these around?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1101"><a name="pos1101"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> I'm glad to see ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1102"><a name="pos1102"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Only if it is relevant, Mr Bizos, is that ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1103"><a name="pos1103"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> I beg your pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1104"><a name="pos1104"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that document relevant from your point of view?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1105"><a name="pos1105"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> No, and I'm going to make it appear quite irrelevant from the next question, Mr..., can we just reserve that for a moment please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1106"><a name="pos1106"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Certainly, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1107"><a name="pos1107"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> When was the Freedom Front formed, sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1108"><a name="pos1108"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> I do not know, sir, I was never a member.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1109"><a name="pos1109"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Because the evidence of Mr Visser is that some time before the Freedom Front was formed, which we were told was formed in 1994 by Mr Visser, if I remember correctly, he and you and Mr Roodt were members of this informal structure that stole money for the purposes of gathering arms, long before the public pronouncement of the formation of the Freedom Front.   What do you say to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1110"><a name="pos1110"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> I say to that, it is untrue, Mr Visser has told an outrageous lie.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1111"><a name="pos1111"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well, did you discuss the contents of your computer with Mr Visser after Mr Derby-Lewis's arrest?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1112"><a name="pos1112"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> I'm not sure of the nature of your question.   I was doing computer work for Mr Visser, and obviously I did discuss that in depth with him, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1113"><a name="pos1113"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> The contents of your hard disks in your computer you discussed with him because you were doing computer work for him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1114"><a name="pos1114"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1115"><a name="pos1115"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Why would you do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1116"><a name="pos1116"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Because he approached me with a project to investigate bank interest rates, a fairly large project, which is an investigation of clients at banks who have overdrawn accounts, where banks make errors in their favour and the client is charged too much.   If you can then process the client's account with a computer, you can then calculate by how much their client overpaid and then reclaim that money from the bank.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1117"><a name="pos1117"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well let's come directly to the point.   You told the committee that there was uncompromising information in your computer hard disks, but fortunately the police did not have a sufficiently competent expert to dig it out, otherwise you would have been trouble?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1118"><a name="pos1118"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> I do not remember telling him this, but as a matter of fact, Mr Chairman, that part is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1119"><a name="pos1119"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well, what was there on your hard disks that would have put you into a compromising position that would get you into trouble?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1120"><a name="pos1120"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Mr Chairman, I'm not prepared to tell you that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1121"><a name="pos1121"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Is that because you feel that if you answer the question truthfully, you may incriminate yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1122"><a name="pos1122"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Possibly, Mr Chairman.   I will state this though, for the record, that whatever I have on my computer, or had on my computer, had nothing, but nothing, to do with fraud or to do with stealing weapons, or to do with selling two-way radios or buying two-way radios.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1123"><a name="pos1123"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Or your relationship with Mr and Mrs Derby-Lewis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1124"><a name="pos1124"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> I cannot say yes or no, I may have had a letter or to so them on the computer, I cannot say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1125"><a name="pos1125"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Or the Hani assassination?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1126"><a name="pos1126"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> That is not true, I have nothing on the computer, or had nothing on the computer related to the Hani assassination.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1127"><a name="pos1127"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> What happened to those compromising hard disks?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1128"><a name="pos1128"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> I still have them, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1129"><a name="pos1129"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well we would only have your word that they were the ones that you spoke to Mr Visser about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1130"><a name="pos1130"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> You have my word for that, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1131"><a name="pos1131"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well, your relationship with Mr and Mrs Derby-Lewis, firstly attention was drawn to the fact that Mrs Derby-Lewis's diary was punctuated with appointments between her and you on a fairly regular basis before Mr Hani's death?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1132"><a name="pos1132"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> That would be correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1133"><a name="pos1133"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> What were all these appointments about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1134"><a name="pos1134"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> I was helping Mr Derby-Lewis and Mrs Derby-Lewis on a regular basis.   At that time we were preparing for a bye-election in Krugersdorp, and I was there on many occasions helping with this, also helping Mr Derby-Lewis with computer work related to that bye-election.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1135"><a name="pos1135"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> It wasn't just friendship that you, if I recall Mrs Derby-Lewis's evidence correctly, you were living alone and you would pop in once in a while for tea and ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1136"><a name="pos1136"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Let me say usually there would be a reason why I would drop in, but I'm not ashamed to say that I'm proud to call Clive Derby-Lewis and Gaye Derby-Lewis my friends.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1137"><a name="pos1137"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Are you proud of the fact that they killed, that he, at least, admits to having killed Mr Hani?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1138"><a name="pos1138"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> It was a time of war.   In a time of war, if someone stands up and does something for his God and for his country, then I applaud that fact, sir.   That it was Mr Hani was incidental.   I have never met the man, I have nothing personal against him, it was an act of war.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1139"><a name="pos1139"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Did you discuss, during these various occasions, on these various occasions when you and Mr Derby-Lewis and Mrs Derby-Lewis spoke, about the local election and the other minutiae about the state of war that the country was in in March/April 1993?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1140"><a name="pos1140"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Sorry, sir, was that a question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1141"><a name="pos1141"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.   Did you discuss with them that there was a state of war during March/April '93?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1142"><a name="pos1142"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> I cannot remember a specific incident, but the topic was very widely discussed at the time, I'm convinced that we must have discussed it, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1143"><a name="pos1143"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And what was the nature of the war that you and Mr and Mrs Derby-Lewis thought that was going on at the time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1144"><a name="pos1144"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> There's no doubt of what the nature of the war was, Mr Chairman.   We have an atheist, communist, terrorist organisation, which was in the process of taking over the country, and the consequences for us would be pretty severe.  Some of the consequences we are seeing today.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1145"><a name="pos1145"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.   Did you regard Mr Chris Hani as the anti-Christ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1146"><a name="pos1146"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> I don't remember actually saying that, but I would not argue with the definition.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1147"><a name="pos1147"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Did not, in your discussions with Mr Derby-Lewis, possibly refer to Mr Hani as the anti-Christ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1148"><a name="pos1148"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Not that I can specifically recall, though it is possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1149"><a name="pos1149"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And if there was this war, and if you regarded him as the anti-Christ, what was your feeling at the time, would his death have served your cause?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1150"><a name="pos1150"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> I was not in a position to make any decisions of that nature, I can only say that in a state of undeclared war such as we were in, the modus operandi of most concerned people was to sit and do nothing.   When someone does something, I'm not prepared to condemn it, even if they make a mistake.   In every war you find occasions where they kill their own soldiers.   It's a matter of someone has to do something.   If it's wrong, that is very sad, try not to repeat your mistakes.   That is in a time of war.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1151"><a name="pos1151"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> You know that your evidence is almost a carbon copy of some of the things, on this issue, a carbon copy of what Mr Derby-Lewis has told this committee, Mr Clark?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1152"><a name="pos1152"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Maybe sir, that is because I look up to Mr Derby-Lewis with great respect and I respect his point of view, and perhaps unconsciously I've adopted some of those points of view and I'm not ashamed of it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1153"><a name="pos1153"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And we understand that Mr Derby-Lewis's home was a place where braaivleis and other entertainments were held by persons sharing his and your view about Mr Hani being the anti-Christ and an enemy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1154"><a name="pos1154"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> That is certainly correct, sir, and there are, yes, a vast number of people who share this view.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1155"><a name="pos1155"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Who were at Mr Derby-Lewis's braaivleises?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1156"><a name="pos1156"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> There were a number of occasions there, and some of them were braaivleises, indeed, as you say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1157"><a name="pos1157"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And one of the persons that attended those braaivleises was Mr Walus, the first applicant in this case?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1158"><a name="pos1158"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> That is correct, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1159"><a name="pos1159"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> On how many occasions did you meet him at the Derby-Lewis home?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1160"><a name="pos1160"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> I could not say how many times, but several times indeed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1161"><a name="pos1161"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Several times.   During what period, would you say from the middle of 1992 up to and including his arrest on the 10th of April 1993?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1162"><a name="pos1162"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> I cannot confirm your first date, sir, I cannot remember, but it may be so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1163"><a name="pos1163"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.   But you met him at Derby-Lewis's home regularly before the 10th of April 1993 where these discussions about the undeclared war and saving Christianity and saving South Africa were loudly and clearly declared?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1164"><a name="pos1164"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Not correct, Mr Chairman, you stated there that I met him regularly, that is not true, I met him on a few occasions and they were not shortly after one another, and at such a nature, it is usually a jolly occasion and to discuss such serious matters there was not usually done.  That may have been done in corners, but that is certainly not the nature or the reason for the braaivleis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1165"><a name="pos1165"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well, did Mr Derby-Lewis ever express to you how he thought the country could be saved?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1166"><a name="pos1166"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> We had several discussions, many of which were not in private, I don't recall exactly what Mr Derby-Lewis told me, perhaps if you ask in more detail, I could confirm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1167"><a name="pos1167"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well, we must rely on you and Mr Derby-Lewis on that for the time being, but did you have private discussions with Mr Derby-Lewis as to how the problems of the country could be solved?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1168"><a name="pos1168"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Let me explain this way, at that time the main focus was still on elections and fighting an election, and that is where most of my efforts went.   If we had other discussions, I cannot remember at this point.   It is possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1169"><a name="pos1169"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well let me see if I understand you correctly, that the overall purpose of your discussions was during 1992 and the first third of '93 was how the country could be saved by elections?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1170"><a name="pos1170"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> That would certainly have been on the agenda, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1171"><a name="pos1171"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And was Mr Derby-Lewis enthusiastic about this, as to how the country could be saved by election?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1172"><a name="pos1172"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Mr Derby-Lewis is a very positive person, I'm sure he was always enthusiastic, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1173"><a name="pos1173"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> About saving the country by participating in elections?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1174"><a name="pos1174"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> You are taking me over a long period of time.  Earlier on, most certainly there was that chance.   Later on, it became obvious to even those who cannot see that an election was no longer an option, and at some point in between, discussions must have taken place, I cannot remember specifically between myself and Mr Derby-Lewis, but discussions of that nature were widely held amongst our entire fraternity.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1175"><a name="pos1175"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Who, give us a few names of your entire fraternity, let's have this fraternity make itself known that so proudly wanted to save the country, give us a few names please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1176"><a name="pos1176"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> That discussed it with me in private?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1177"><a name="pos1177"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> No.   Give us the names of the people that you say were discussing the fact that elections were no longer an option and that anyone who had eyes to see knew that elections were no longer an option, give us a few names of those people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1178"><a name="pos1178"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Certainly.   Let's start with Dr Andries Treurnicht.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1179"><a name="pos1179"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes, in public meetings?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1180"><a name="pos1180"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Yes, at public meetings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1181"><a name="pos1181"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes, we have a record of what Dr Treurnicht said.  Talk to us about the braaivleis talk?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1182"><a name="pos1182"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> The braaivleis talk went about sunny skies and Chevrolet, Mr Chairman, I can't remember discussing other issues there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1183"><a name="pos1183"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Oh.   So you're not, when you spoke about fraternity, did you mean Dr Treurnicht and who else?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1184"><a name="pos1184"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> We can look at other leadership figures who in the public ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1185"><a name="pos1185"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> No, fraternity, fraternity means brothers, the people that you meet regularly.   You use the word fraternity, you use English particularly carefully and well, Mr Clark, who was in this fraternity that thought that elections were no longer an answer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1186"><a name="pos1186"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Friends of mine whom I regularly met with, is that what you're saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1187"><a name="pos1187"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Who are your friends that you regularly met with that thought that elections were no longer an answer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1188"><a name="pos1188"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Do you wish me to list an entire list of all my friends so that they can be victimised as I was victimised after I was arrested, Mr Chairman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1189"><a name="pos1189"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Are you not prepared to give us the names of the people who were saying in March/April 1993, at braaivleises held at Mr Derby-Lewis's home or elsewhere, that election holding is no longer an answer to the country's problems?   Please give us the names of the fraternity that was saying that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1190"><a name="pos1190"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Mr Chairman, does Mr Bizos want to know who went to braaivleises in April 1994?    He mentioned specifically a specific month?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1191"><a name="pos1191"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Mr Chairman, I did specify the period and the intervention is unnecessary.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1192"><a name="pos1192"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The speaker's mike is not on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1193"><a name="pos1193"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sorry.   I was listening to the translation of her remark, so I can't pay attention, I didn't pay attention to what you were saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1194"><a name="pos1194"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.   I'll repeat the question, which I submit there may be (indistinct).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1195"><a name="pos1195"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.   You're not required to answer ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1196"><a name="pos1196"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> In March/April ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1197"><a name="pos1197"></a>(inaudible)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1198"><a name="pos1198"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1199"><a name="pos1199"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> Mike please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1200"><a name="pos1200"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...use the word fraternity, you and - who talked about the fact that elections were no longer an option?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1201"><a name="pos1201"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1202"><a name="pos1202"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Bizos would like to know whether you are prepared to disclose what that fraternity was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1203"><a name="pos1203"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Let me first define my fraternity, as such, was not only the people who attended Mr Derby-Lewis's braaivleis, I have a far wider circle of friends than that.  I do not feel that disclosing the names of every single one of my friend with whom I may have discussed this, and there are a great many, would serve any positive purpose.   I can tell you this, that there's a possibility I discussed it with Mr Derby-Lewis, Mr Walus I do not know well, and I am quite sure I did not discuss it with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1204"><a name="pos1204"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Did you discuss it with Mrs Derby-Lewis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1205"><a name="pos1205"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> It is possible, though I cannot remember a specific instance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1206"><a name="pos1206"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Now, the relationship between you and Mr Derby-Lewis and Mrs Derby-Lewis, politically speaking, was a very close one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1207"><a name="pos1207"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> I would agree to that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1208"><a name="pos1208"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> You also had a common objective, you wanted to save South Africa?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1209"><a name="pos1209"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Naturally, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1210"><a name="pos1210"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> You have already told us that there were too many people that were prepared to do nothing, and that action was called for?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1211"><a name="pos1211"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> That is correct, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1212"><a name="pos1212"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Elections were no longer the way forward?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1213"><a name="pos1213"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Can I put it this way, it's a matter of changing priorities.   Elections were showing less and less chance of promise to redeem the matter, and therefore alternatives had to be looked at, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1214"><a name="pos1214"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Right.   Just let's confine the matter amongst the three of you, Mr Derby-Lewis, Mrs Derby-Lewis and yourself, once there was this consensus amongst the three of you, what alternatives to elections were discussed by the three of you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1215"><a name="pos1215"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Mr Chairman, I have a wide circle of friends.   Mr Derby-Lewis, my help to him went primarily around the elections.   Whatever other businesses I may have, I wouldn't have even considered really involving Mr Derby-Lewis, he's too busy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1216"><a name="pos1216"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Did you hear the question, sir?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1217"><a name="pos1217"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> I discussed, I cannot remember discussing things of that nature with them, though it is possible, but certainly not any sort of planning, though it is possible that it was discussed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1218"><a name="pos1218"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Now, it's possible that the three of you discussed what?   Remember what the question was, there was consensus among you that elections are no good, you want to save the country, other steps have to be taken, whilst the three of you were there at their home, what other options did you discuss?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1219"><a name="pos1219"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> I cannot remember specifically discussing another option with them.   Most of what I discussed there went around the elections, that was why I was there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1220"><a name="pos1220"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> But surely, if you felt so strongly that a by-election in Krugersdorp wouldn't matter tuppence in relation to the future of the country, why would you not have discussed the other options available?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1221"><a name="pos1221"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> That is not correct, Mr Chairman, I did not state that by-elections did not matter tuppence.   If by-elections did not matter at all at that time, I would not have wasted my time walking down streets and knocking on doors and fighting with dogs.   By-elections then were still a possibility.   At any stage, any responsible person would prefer to avoid bloodshed ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1222"><a name="pos1222"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Was that ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1223"><a name="pos1223"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> ...and by-elections is a peaceful means of achieving change, and I support peaceful means of achieving change if possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1224"><a name="pos1224"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Did Mr Derby-Lewis share your view about elections at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1225"><a name="pos1225"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> I believe he did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1226"><a name="pos1226"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Did he say so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1227"><a name="pos1227"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> I cannot remember him specifically saying so, but if he did not believe that, why would he stand in a by-election?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1228"><a name="pos1228"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well, did you discuss how important elections were in order to show the feeling of the people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1229"><a name="pos1229"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Mr Chairman, I think it's important to realise that no responsible person would throw by-elections out as an avenue if it was still available.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1230"><a name="pos1230"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> I merely want to establish as a fact, for the purposes of the committee, that during March/April 1993, Mr Derby-Lewis still believed in the ballot box?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1231"><a name="pos1231"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Mr Derby-Lewis, at that point, I am sure, was well aware of the diminishing chances of the ballot box, but nevertheless, being the upright Christian man that he is, he's prepared to give it a last shot, and in that sense I was prepared to help him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1232"><a name="pos1232"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.   So that if he or anyone else told us by that time he had come to the conclusion that the elections were a waste of time and that the only way to solve the country's problems was to kill the anti-Christ Hani, and we are going to submit, although he does not admit it at this stage, the other leadership of the SACP and the ANC, that he was either not being frank with you or he did not say?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1233"><a name="pos1233"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Mr Chairman, let me put something in perspective, things are not quite as black and white and as simplistic as you are stating.   Even when it regards the by-elections, the by-elections that were being fought were fraudulent on their own.   The National Party, on many occasions, used less than upright and honest means to gain victories, and the diminishing chance in the ballot box was really one that is being pushed for its own sake, but I do not believe that anyone who was active and concerned in those days, would have ignored other options and just pushed for the ballot box.   You hope for a miracle, go for the ballot box, that is fine, but to ignore other options would be very foolish indeed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1234"><a name="pos1234"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> You say that you were discriminated or treated unfairly by the police, do you, Mr Clark?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1235"><a name="pos1235"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Most definitely, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1236"><a name="pos1236"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Your name was found in the diary of the wife of the man that was apparently correctly suspected of having killed Mr Hani?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1237"><a name="pos1237"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> My name was found in the diary of Mrs Derby-Lewis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1238"><a name="pos1238"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1239"><a name="pos1239"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> In regard to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1240"><a name="pos1240"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well to being a regular visitor to that house.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1241"><a name="pos1241"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> That would be correct, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1242"><a name="pos1242"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Were you asked to make a statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1243"><a name="pos1243"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> By the police, yes sir, I was indeed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1244"><a name="pos1244"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Did you resist in the beginning?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1245"><a name="pos1245"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> No, I was quite happy to make a statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1246"><a name="pos1246"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And did you make a statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1247"><a name="pos1247"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1248"><a name="pos1248"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And you were released within what period?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1249"><a name="pos1249"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> I was released before the day was over.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1250"><a name="pos1250"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> What is your complaint against the police?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1251"><a name="pos1251"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> The police deny that I was arrested.   I fail to bring that together with the fact that they knocked me up before five o'clock in the morning, told me I was not allowed to use my telephone, because this was section 29, drove me all over the place, refused me the facility to contact my lawyer, and basically I was incarcerated for a period until roughly the middle of the day, before things started to change.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1252"><a name="pos1252"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And you made a statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1253"><a name="pos1253"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> I made a statement during that morning, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1254"><a name="pos1254"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> No, not at the end of the end of the ordeal.   By mid-afternoon I knew what was going on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1255"><a name="pos1255"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> What was going on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1256"><a name="pos1256"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> My advocate at that time had found out that the police in fact had no warrant for my arrest, had no authority whatsoever to arrest me, to confiscate my computer equipment, my computer disks, to search my premises, they had no authority whatsoever, and he informed me of this, he managed to get a telephone call through to the police station where I was being held.   When he informed me of this, I walked to where they were looking at my computer, I uncoupled the power and I informed them that I objected in the strongest terms to them looking at my computer equipment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1257"><a name="pos1257"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And they succumbed to your request?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1258"><a name="pos1258"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> They did not.   They informed me in very strong terms that I would sit down at a place, the words I remember very clearly, "Sit Edwin, or else", and I had to sit, and I've got these big policemen standing over me, you've got no choice whatsoever but sit, while they switch your computer equipment back on and carry on with their devious deeds.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1259"><a name="pos1259"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.   There may have been information, in their view, in your computer that you may have been involved in the murder of Mr Hani.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1260"><a name="pos1260"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> I cannot tell what they thought, I can only tell that they were operating against the law and I object in the strongest possible terms.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1261"><a name="pos1261"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Now I am going to put to you, Mr Clark, that you, together with a small clique of close friends of the Derby-Lewis's, must of necessity have been in some way involved, or at least had knowledge of the plans to kill Mr Hani?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1262"><a name="pos1262"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> I would not know, sir, because I had no knowledge of such a plan, and I would not have anticipated at that point that Mr Derby-Lewis would have knowledge of such a plan, because he was fighting an election.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1263"><a name="pos1263"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And I'm going to put to you that the evidence of Mr Visser, the whole of it, in relation to you and the other person that he mentioned, Roodt, is true and that your evidence is false?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1264"><a name="pos1264"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> I would deny such an allegation, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1265"><a name="pos1265"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And in this co-operation that you were taking part in with Mr Roodt, who was senior, you or he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1266"><a name="pos1266"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> I do not understand the question, me with Mr Roodt, what were we doing together?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1267"><a name="pos1267"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well, Mr Visser said that there were structures, that there were cells of sorts, and one of them consisted of him, yourself and Mr Roodt, and that money was being stolen for arms and two-way radios ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1268"><a name="pos1268"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The speaker's microphone is not on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1269"><a name="pos1269"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> ...for the war that was coming ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1270"><a name="pos1270"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did he say that was a cell, Mr Bizos?   I understood that the cells were something completely different that Mr Roodt was in charge of in Western Transvaal, they were AWB cells.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1271"><a name="pos1271"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.   No I used the word, I used the word ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1272"><a name="pos1272"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The speaker's microphone is not on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1273"><a name="pos1273"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> ...loosely and not, that it was a small group, that's all, Mr Chairman, not a formalised group, I've made it quite clear that it was not a formalised group in 1992 on the evidence of Mr Visser.   That you, Mr Visser, leave out the question of cell, you, Mr Visser and Mr Roodt were busy stealing money to be used for the purposes of the war that you now say was inevitable?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1274"><a name="pos1274"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Mr Chairman, I never knew Mr Visser was interested enough in politics to do such a thing.   I deny the allegation, I deny that Mr Visser and I did anything of any nature, of any political nature.   Mr Roodt, I am aware was involved with the AWB, as the chairman correctly states, I am not aware that Mr Roodt did anything politically with Mr Visser, though you perhaps have to ask him that.   He certainly had nothing to do with me directly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1275"><a name="pos1275"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well can you advance any reason why Mr Visser should go to the trouble of applying for amnesty, involving you and Mr Roodt in it, when you say that you had nothing else than business dealings with Mr Visser?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1276"><a name="pos1276"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Yes, Mr Chairman, I can.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1277"><a name="pos1277"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes, what do you suggest?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1278"><a name="pos1278"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> I think the situation is fairly transparent, Mr Chairman.    Mr Visser was sentenced to serve a term in jail for a number of fraud charges.   If, however, he can find a loophole and prove that his fraud charges were political, then he doesn't have to go to jail now, does he, and therefore he can involve me, scandalise my name in the newspapers and various other things, in order for him not to go to jail.   It's a very deep self-interest story and I feel very sorry for the man, but I do not excuse lies and his damned lies in that regard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1279"><a name="pos1279"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And what about Mr Roodt?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1280"><a name="pos1280"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> I have no knowledge of Mr Roodt doing anything of that nature.   I do know him, but I really don't know anything else about him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1281"><a name="pos1281"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well we have been informed that he too applied for amnesty for the same thing, as far as I know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1282"><a name="pos1282"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> You would have to ask Mr Roodt, I really have no knowledge of that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1283"><a name="pos1283"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> But there would be other reasons, if Mr Roodt has implicated you in any way, there would have to be other reasons for it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1284"><a name="pos1284"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Yes sir, but in his case I have no idea why.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1285"><a name="pos1285"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> And I'm going to put to you that, having regard to the manner in which you expressed yourself in relation to Mr Hani, there would have been no reason whatsoever for Mrs Derby-Lewis and Mr Derby-Lewis to keep any plan that they may have been involved in a secret from you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1286"><a name="pos1286"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> I cannot agree with that, sir.   First of all, they did keep it a secret from me, and second of all, I was busy with other matters, they were busy fighting a by-election, I was helping them with that, I was helping them walk the streets, I was doing computer work for both Mr Derby-Lewis and for Mrs Derby-Lewis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1287"><a name="pos1287"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> If you were consistent with yourself, all those would have been minutiae in order to save the country by killing the anti-Christ?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1288"><a name="pos1288"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Let me state that Mr Derby-Lewis was the morally correct option which should also be followed, so that at the end of the day I can say I tried every peaceful avenue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1289"><a name="pos1289"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> You wouldn't have, if he had mentioned it to you, you would have thought that the stage had not been reached to kill him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1290"><a name="pos1290"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> No, I did not say that, it's in the hands of God, Mr Chairman, providence places certain events before you and possibly, had someone approached me instead of Mr Walus, then possibly I might have been that person, I don't know.  The point is, I was not approached, and I did not know anything of the matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1291"><a name="pos1291"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Let me see if I understand you correctly.   You say that if Mr Derby-Lewis approached you to do it, you would have done it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1292"><a name="pos1292"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> I looked up very much to Mr Derby-Lewis and I respect him as a person, I respect him as a leadership figure, and ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1293"><a name="pos1293"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> What is the answer to the question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1294"><a name="pos1294"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> The answer is that I would seriously have considered it and quite possibly I would have said yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1295"><a name="pos1295"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well, with that frame of mind, why should - which frame of mind was well known to Mr Derby-Lewis, why should he have kept it a secret from you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1296"><a name="pos1296"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Mr Chairman, I was not then in any position of leadership.   Perhaps that is a question you should rather ask Mr Derby-Lewis, I did not discuss that nature of strategy with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1297"><a name="pos1297"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Yes.   Did you have anything to do with the list?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1298"><a name="pos1298"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> With which list, Mr Chairman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1299"><a name="pos1299"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> A list containing the names of the leadership of the African National Congress, the Communist Party, a few journalists, Mr Justice Goldstone and a few others.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1300"><a name="pos1300"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> You're referring to the infamous list which was reported in the newspapers in those days, no, I was totally unaware of that particular list.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1301"><a name="pos1301"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Did you ever go to Rotunda with anybody?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1302"><a name="pos1302"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Yes I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1303"><a name="pos1303"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> With whom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1304"><a name="pos1304"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> I went there with Mrs Derby-Lewis and with Mr Arthur - I didn't go with Mr Arthur Kemp, he came while we were there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1305"><a name="pos1305"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Now why did you go to the Rotunda with Mrs Derby-Lewis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1306"><a name="pos1306"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> She had to take a bus down, I cannot remember to where, to a far away location, and I was basically her taxi service for the day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1307"><a name="pos1307"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Weren't you too busy to be a mere taxi driver?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1308"><a name="pos1308"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> For Mrs Derby-Lewis, not at all, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1309"><a name="pos1309"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Oh, so great was your affection for the Derby-Lewis's?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1310"><a name="pos1310"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Sir, when people sacrifice everything they have for a greater cause, who am I, who is much smaller and do far less than they, to refuse a small request like that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1311"><a name="pos1311"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> What had they sacrificed then?   Mr Derby-Lewis was earning a fat salary at the Presidents Council, Mrs Derby-Lewis was working as a journalist, what sacrifice had they made then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1312"><a name="pos1312"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Not correct, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1313"><a name="pos1313"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Bizos, I don't know whether all this has anything to do with the present application.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1314"><a name="pos1314"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> As it pleases you, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1315"><a name="pos1315"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> There should be some limit to the kind of questions you put to this witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1316"><a name="pos1316"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well, it was in response to an answer which - now, you see, did Mrs Derby-Lewis on the way tell you that she was giving Mr Kemp a list in order to reconnoitre their houses?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1317"><a name="pos1317"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> No sir, she did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1318"><a name="pos1318"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Or to do, that's a list which she required for the purposes, for journalistic purposes, for Mr Kemp to find out how these people were living?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1319"><a name="pos1319"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> No sir, she did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1320"><a name="pos1320"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Did she speak to Mr Kemp in your presence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1321"><a name="pos1321"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> As far as I can recall, they had a private conversation, I do not remember if they asked me to leave or not, I cannot recall that, but certainly nothing of a confidential nature was discussed in my presence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1322"><a name="pos1322"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> If this was an innocent list, there would have been no need to discuss it in a confidential manner?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1323"><a name="pos1323"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> I cannot remember anything being discussed in a confidential manner, I did not, at the time, think anything strange at all.   I remember Mr Kemp coming, either to collect something or to give something, I cannot remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1324"><a name="pos1324"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Why did you call the list an infamous list?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1325"><a name="pos1325"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Because of the way it was treated by the newspapers, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1326"><a name="pos1326"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well how did they treat it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1327"><a name="pos1327"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> The newspapers treated it as a list which had been drawn up as though it was an assassination list, and from what I gathered about the list, the allegations that that list was for that particular purpose seemed ridiculous to me.   Some of the names on it may have been suitable for</p>
<p class="line" id="line1328"><a name="pos1328"></a>that particular purpose, but some of the other names are patently ridiculous.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1329"><a name="pos1329"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well I'm going to suggest to you that you are well versed with the Derby-Lewis's defence, both in their trial and their story that they told this committee, judging by your last answer, Mr Clark.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1330"><a name="pos1330"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> That's not a question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1331"><a name="pos1331"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Are you well aware of what the nature of their defence was at the trial and what the story is that they are putting up before the committee?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1347"><a name="pos1347"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR PRINSLOO:</span> Mr Clark, during 1993, were you a member of the Conservative Party?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1348"><a name="pos1348"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Yes, I was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1349"><a name="pos1349"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And did you support the Conservative Party?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1350"><a name="pos1350"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Yes, I did, definitely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1351"><a name="pos1351"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> In any way, at that stage, during 1993, as you have already testified, you perceived a state of undeclared war, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1352"><a name="pos1352"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Undeclared, yes.   As Dr Treurnicht appeared under a large banner which stated that the third struggle for freedom had begun.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1353"><a name="pos1353"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> You said that you had a large group of friends and in your society which you experienced, everybody was experiencing the same feelings that you were experiencing.  Did you think in any way that anything noticeable would emerge with the CODESA negotiations, at that stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1354"><a name="pos1354"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Chairperson, there was a small chance, but if one had to think about it realistically, the chances were pretty much zero, one could only have hoped that someone more sensible, or meaningful would come to the fore, but that is not what happened.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1355"><a name="pos1355"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> There was testimony from those who experienced it, that CODESA was ruled by members of the Communist Party?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1365"><a name="pos1365"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Very well, proceed with your question.   Try and make it as relevant as possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1366"><a name="pos1366"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I'll do that, Mr Chairman.   Did you, at that point in time, as you have said there was a state of war and there was testimony from Dr Hartzenberg and others who said that they would have fought for this territory ...(inter-vention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1367"><a name="pos1367"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1368"><a name="pos1368"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> ...at that stage did you think that any election would help to prevent a takeover of the country, to be realistic?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1372"><a name="pos1372"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Mr Hartzenberg's evidence is to the contrary, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1373"><a name="pos1373"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think that we have evidence about Mr Derby-Lewis's and others that there was some kind of a state of war as far as they were concerned.   I don't know whether there's any need to repeat all that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1374"><a name="pos1374"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Mr Chairman, in view of the fact of the questions that was put by Mr Bizos to this witness, and his perceptions, that's what I'm asking him about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1375"><a name="pos1375"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well his perceptions were that there was, as far as he's concerned, a state of war, an undeclared war.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1376"><a name="pos1376"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I'll accept that, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1377"><a name="pos1377"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He's gone to the extent of saying that had he been asked by Mr Derby-Lewis to take part in any assassi-nation, he may have considered joining Mr Derby-Lewis, he's gone to that extent.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1378"><a name="pos1378"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I'll pose another question, Mr Chairman, I'll leave it at that.   Mr Clark, did you see that there would be a definite takeover by a majority government, the ANC/ SACP alliance?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1379"><a name="pos1379"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Just to correct you, not a majority government, the South African Communist Party was a very small minority, they controlled the ANC as a minority within the majority of the ANC party, and in that sense it would be as in all other communist governments worldwide, that a minority would rule and not the majority, and that the majority would remain the victims.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1380"><a name="pos1380"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you see that there would be such a takeover?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1381"><a name="pos1381"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1382"><a name="pos1382"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Did you feel that that kind of takeover would be able to be stopped by an election?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1383"><a name="pos1383"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> One, to the largest degree, should not remove passivism, but in that stage we tried to keep the passive road open, one should never close a door behind one that one cannot open again, and that is why one should proceed along those channels, although it would appear to be futile, and if the Almighty opened another door for you, then one should go through that door.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1384"><a name="pos1384"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No further questions, thank you, Chairperson.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1386"><a name="pos1386"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> On behalf of Mr Walus, do you have any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1387"><a name="pos1387"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS VAN DER WALT:</span> The questions which Mr Bizos asked emphasised that it was not only about the anti-Christ and the struggle, was that all that it was about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1388"><a name="pos1388"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> The anti-Christ probably is quite a large element, because religious freedom does not exist within a communist government, it is, or religion is oppressed, but it was about communism, communism was the major issue in this case.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1409"><a name="pos1409"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> The question I'm going to ask you is solely from the point of view that unfortunately you have experienced some inconveniences due to the non-appearances of some witnesses, including yourself ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1410"><a name="pos1410"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1411"><a name="pos1411"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> ...for therefore various reasons ...(inter-vention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1412"><a name="pos1412"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1413"><a name="pos1413"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> ...and in that context, I recall that you said, notwithstanding the fact that you knew that counsel for the committee wanted to talk to you, or wanted you to testify, you chose to stay away and not to make yourselves available?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1414"><a name="pos1414"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> That is correct, sir, I will give you a truthful reason if you want a reason.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1415"><a name="pos1415"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Yes, I want it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1416"><a name="pos1416"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Mr Chairman, the TRC is not impartial enough in its affairs, in fact it is quite understandable that some people refer to the TRC as a farce.   The TRC was not only wrongly structured since its inception, but is also not representative of the population as the law requires.  I'm quoting, as you may recall, words spoken by Advocate Chris de Jager.   One could reasonably presume that a TRC advocate should know.   I do not recognise the TRC as a properly constructed legal body.   In the public eye the TRC is political biased against opponents of the ANC, and is not part of the solution, but forms a significant part of the problem in our troubled land.   In a nutshell, Mr Chairman, the TRC has no moral credibility.   Nevertheless, I'm prepared, quite prepared, to answer all questions relevant to this inquiry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1417"><a name="pos1417"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> You very nearly didn't have the opportunity to say all those things that you have been saying.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1418"><a name="pos1418"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> I answered the question truthfully, as requested, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1419"><a name="pos1419"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> It seems to me, from what you are reading, you have considerable difficulties with the TRC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1420"><a name="pos1420"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> I do indeed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1421"><a name="pos1421"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> And I assume that includes the amnesty hearing before which you were sought to come and testify by counsel for the committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1422"><a name="pos1422"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Mr Chairman, it's a strange contradiction, because the TRC, yourself, have to look at each case independently, and in most cases I can see that you actually try your level best to give a sound and welcome sort of judgment.   However, to quote Mr Chris de Jager, it is not structured correctly, and he has a particular problem, and I'd like to quote Mr Chris de Jager for exactly the reason why he has a problem, and I support what he says, he says, I'll read it in Afrikaans ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1423"><a name="pos1423"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Sir, are we on the same wave length?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1424"><a name="pos1424"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Yes, I think so.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1427"><a name="pos1427"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> I was talking about the committee.   You don't have to go further in your answer, you don't have to go further in your ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1428"><a name="pos1428"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> I'm then ignorant, I don't know the difference between the two.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1429"><a name="pos1429"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Yes, yes.   Do you persist you want to go further with your answer, or do you want to stop there, because for my part I think you have answered my question, but if you want to go on, you can.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1430"><a name="pos1430"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> I think let me finish this, because it would clarify my attitude and perhaps show why I have a problem with the TRC and not with any particular individual, Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1431"><a name="pos1431"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Well why I stopped you is because you're going to read something which is irrelevant, you're going to read ...(intervention).</p>

<p class="line" id="line1433"><a name="pos1433"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Well you are going to read Mr De Jager's statement with regard to the commission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1434"><a name="pos1434"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> The TRC as a whole, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1435"><a name="pos1435"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Are you aware Mr De Jager is still aware of the Amnesty Committee, are you aware of that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1436"><a name="pos1436"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> He apparently wanted to leave and then I don't know whether he changed his mind or he came back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1437"><a name="pos1437"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> No, not this committee.   So you are in a wrong direction altogether.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1438"><a name="pos1438"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> I'm talking about the TRC as a whole, of which you form a part, sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1439"><a name="pos1439"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> I'm not talking about the TRC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1440"><a name="pos1440"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> I am.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1441"><a name="pos1441"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Let me just clear it up, Mr Chris de Jager is very much a member of the Amnesty Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1442"><a name="pos1442"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1443"><a name="pos1443"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He was a member of the TRC and asked to be excused, he is no longer a member of the TRC, of the commission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1444"><a name="pos1444"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> No, my problem then is not with the Amnesty Committee, as such, my problem is that certain cases are put before you and you yourselves do not apparently have power, or do not exercise the power to unbiasly bring people before this court, as it should be.   For example, we look at the ignored 500 IFP assassinations.   These assassinations will never be discussed here, so is the public perception.   We look at the ANC blanket amnesties.   Now, this may not have appeared in front of your particular group, but the fact is that in the public eye, these things matter, and ...(inter-vention).</p>

<p class="line" id="line1451"><a name="pos1451"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Now I just wanted to accept that you have said that you had some difficulties in coming to offer your evidence at the request of certain people, and I got the impression that once asked by counsel for the applicants, you did not have any difficulties anymore?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1452"><a name="pos1452"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> For them I will do it, for no-one else.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1453"><a name="pos1453"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Why?   Is it as a result of the strong relationship between you and the applicants, or why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1454"><a name="pos1454"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Yes sir.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1455"><a name="pos1455"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> And by the way, what is the source of this strong bond between you and the applicants?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1456"><a name="pos1456"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Mr Derby-Lewis and I go back a long way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1457"><a name="pos1457"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> In which respect?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1458"><a name="pos1458"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> We fight the same fight, we were friends, we visited one another, and in that sense, for me to refuse to come, if his legal counsel would request that I come, I feel I would be letting him down.   If he did not request me to come, then certainly I would not come, because I do have moral problems with appearing here.   The public perception is that I'm co-operating fully with the TRC, and I do not want to really have that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1459"><a name="pos1459"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Yes.   I will try to maintain the course that I was on.   Is this bond between you and the applicants of a political nature?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1460"><a name="pos1460"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> I would say both, primarily political, but I have the highest respect for the persons of Mr Derby-Lewis and Mrs Derby-Lewis.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1462"><a name="pos1462"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> No, I would not, I would not say that, because he didn't confide in me about the Hani assassination.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1463"><a name="pos1463"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Well until then, did you think you were his confidante?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1464"><a name="pos1464"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Not really, sir.   He is a leader in his own field.   I was performing small tasks for him, I was walking streets, I was working on his computer, I could assume he was doing other things that I don't know about, though I would not have guessed exactly what he was involved in, I would more have thought other people were doing those activities, because he was busy with an election.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1465"><a name="pos1465"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE NGOEPE:</span> Thank you.   Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1466"><a name="pos1466"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Mr Clark, speaking about relationships, what is your relationship with Mr Visser?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1467"><a name="pos1467"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Once I thought it was a friendly relationship, then I ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1468"><a name="pos1468"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> When was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1469"><a name="pos1469"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> That was before Mr Visser refused to pay me my money after I wrote the computer programme.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1470"><a name="pos1470"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> When about was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1471"><a name="pos1471"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> It would have been round about, I guess the same time, March '83 (sic) or thereabouts, I'm not too sure, but at the time that Mr Hani was shot, Mr Visser and I were still on talking, speaking terms, and some time after that I didn't get the money that was due to me, and he had various reasons, and I have sympathy for him, he had legal problems, he explained to me that he had these legal problems and that it was all a big misunderstanding, I believed him, and I was reluctant to take him to court for the monies he owed me, because I was on a friendly footing with him and his wife, his children, and I could see the wife and children having very difficult times, so I basically let it be, and it, before that time we were on a friendly footing and I thought everything was fine.   Subsequent to that, customers started paying out money, and I never received my fair share of the money.   I spent months writing a computer programme, for which I received not a cent.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1472"><a name="pos1472"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Can you think of any reason why he is drawing you into this business around the JCI cheque?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1473"><a name="pos1473"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Yes indeed I can, sir.   He was sentenced to go and spend a term in prison.   If he can get amnesty, clearly he doesn't have to spend time in prison, and who is the only political contact he has, because he himself was never involved politically, his only political contact is me, and through me, Mr Clive Derby-Lewis.   One of the fraud cases happens to be slightly before Mr Hani's assassination, and this seems to have been terribly convenient.   I do have proof here in front of me, if I may just bring that into it as well, proof of this particular money that was stolen just before Mr Hani was assassinated ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1474"><a name="pos1474"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> I've heard you said that ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1475"><a name="pos1475"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> ...and this particular ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1476"><a name="pos1476"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> ...it was stolen ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1477"><a name="pos1477"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> ...shows that it was stolen in the post.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1478"><a name="pos1478"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Ja, in the post.   That's why I ...(inter-vention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1479"><a name="pos1479"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Now he mentioned ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1480"><a name="pos1480"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Ja?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1481"><a name="pos1481"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> ...that I got it from a certain person at JCI, and that person's name has been mentioned in newspapers as well ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1482"><a name="pos1482"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1483"><a name="pos1483"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> ...and this offends me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1484"><a name="pos1484"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Yes, that might be so, I just want to try and clarify something else.   What, and Mr Roodt, what is Mr Roodt's situation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1485"><a name="pos1485"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> I was on friendly terms with him.   I'm aware he was a member of the AWB.   We went out on a few AWB things, get-togethers, I was not an AWB member myself, but I am aware Mr Roodt was, but he's quite a lot older than myself, our dealings were polite and cordial, more friendly, but nothing more to it than that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1486"><a name="pos1486"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> But Mr Roodt was also, if I understood the evidence correctly, he seems to also have been involved in politics at that stage, in '93?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1487"><a name="pos1487"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> He was a member of the AWB and he was certainly very concerned at events in the country, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1488"><a name="pos1488"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Would he have been in a position to present Mr Visser with a political cover for his amnesty application?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1489"><a name="pos1489"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> I presume Mr Visser needs witnesses and possibly he can, but really you should call Mr Roodt, I don't really know enough.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1490"><a name="pos1490"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Yes, I'm trying to understand why he pulled you into this thing, I mean you say that he's obviously looking ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1491"><a name="pos1491"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Well, Mr Visser ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1492"><a name="pos1492"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Ja, he's obviously looking for a political cover?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1493"><a name="pos1493"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Why Mr Visser would do it is obvious to me, why Mr Roodt would do it, I don't know, that, to me, is a total mystery.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1494"><a name="pos1494"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Ja.   Well I don't know what Roodt, I believe that, I've heard there was reference to an amnesty application, but I'm more concerned about Visser, because you say that he actually approached you and he wanted you to apply?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1495"><a name="pos1495"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> He wanted me to apply, and he gave me really a cock and bull story, and I just distanced myself from this rubbish, I'm not prepared to go and lie like this for the man, I'm prepared to help him in various ways, but I'm certainly not prepared to do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1496"><a name="pos1496"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> And that was after doing you in with your money ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1497"><a name="pos1497"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Yes, it was after that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1498"><a name="pos1498"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> ...(indistinct)?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1499"><a name="pos1499"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> It was after that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1500"><a name="pos1500"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> So he had the nerve to actually come back to you and say ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1501"><a name="pos1501"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Well he was promising he would pay eventually, it's one of those things, but yes, I regard it as a nerve to ask, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1502"><a name="pos1502"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> To ask, on top of what he had done, to ask you to falsely in fact involve yourself, first of all, in an amnesty application ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1503"><a name="pos1503"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1504"><a name="pos1504"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> ...and to cover him, who has done you in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1505"><a name="pos1505"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1506"><a name="pos1506"></a><span class="speaker">JUDGE WILSON:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1507"><a name="pos1507"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, thank you very much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1508"><a name="pos1508"></a><span class="speaker">RE-EXAMINATION BY MR BIZOS:</span> Mr Chairman, may I say something in the witness' presence, just in case he has an explanation, because we are going to argue that the Vryheidsfront is a different organisation from the Volksfront.   The Vryheidsfront was as a result of a political break-up of the Volksfront, and the Vryheidsfront took part in the election, the Vryheidsfront took part in the election, the Volksfront remained behind, and the Volksfront was in existence during 1992 (indistinct).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1509"><a name="pos1509"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> If that is the case, Mr Chairman, then why did you accuse me of spying for the Freedom Front?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1510"><a name="pos1510"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well I made, I, because I thought that Volksfront and Vryheid ...(intervention).</p>
<p class="line" id="line1511"><a name="pos1511"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> Mike please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1512"><a name="pos1512"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> ...Volksfront and Vryheidsfront were the same thing, but I have good people around me, who advised me that that was a mistake.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1513"><a name="pos1513"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> But not just a mistake, Mr Chairman, because in Mr Visser's amnesty application, where I did see a copy, Vryheidsfront is mentioned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1514"><a name="pos1514"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Well just point that out to us please, because we read Volksfront in his application.   Have a look on the front page, earlier, and if you'd give us the application, we will draw attention to the Volksfront.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1515"><a name="pos1515"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> I know Volksfront was mentioned there, I would like to look for the occurrence of Vryheidsfront.   If I am mistaken, it is possibly, Mr Chairman, because Mr Bizos used the word Vryheidsfront so often, even in Pretoria, when I was sitting there, where I was being accused of being a spy for them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1516"><a name="pos1516"></a><span class="speaker">MR BIZOS:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1517"><a name="pos1517"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> Well, here on page, is that page 1?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1518"><a name="pos1518"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And on page 2.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1519"><a name="pos1519"></a><span class="speaker">MR CLARK:</span> At the bottom of page 1, the very last word on the last line, Vryheidsfront.   Three organisations are mentioned, Volksfront, Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging and Vryheidsfront.   Of which I provided proof that neither he nor I were members.   You say it's on page 2 as well.   Yes, (b), sub-section 2</p>

<p class="line" id="line1521"><a name="pos1521"></a>I deny it.   I did have dealings with the Volksfront.   At no time was Mr Visser under me or did he do anything with me in any way whatsoever.   I regarded him as basically apolitical.</p>

I want to say at this stage that we have received comprehensive argument already in writing from counsel, that covers the early part of the proceedings, except for what has happened in the last two days.   I trust that we will proceed promptly tomorrow morning at 9:30.   The committee adjourns until then.</p>
