<p class="line" id="line1"><a name="pos1"></a>NICO MARTHINUS PRINSLOO:  (s.u.o.) </p>
<p class="line" id="line2"><a name="pos2"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Motlaung, you can proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line3"><a name="pos3"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR MOTLAUNG:</span> Thank you Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line4"><a name="pos4"></a>	Mr Prinsloo, the statement that was earlier on made by Mr Johan Smit, that these bombs were targeted at blacks, you don't seem to agree with that statement do you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line5"><a name="pos5"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> You see I don't agree with that entirely.  I'd like to express myself a little better by saying that at the stage of the attacks when we were waging the war, we felt that the overwhelming majority of the enemy or the supporters of the ANC in that respect as well as the SACP alliance with the ANC were black people.  That is how we saw it and that is how we had been socialised.</p>
<p class="line" id="line6"><a name="pos6"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTLAUNG:</span> No, I understand, but effectively it seems to me what you are saying is that there was never an instruction from the "generale staf" to the effect that black persons have to be attacked.  Was there ever such an instruction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line7"><a name="pos7"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> You must understand that at that stage it was pertinently put to everybody, everybody was aware of it, as well as the generals in staff, and this had been communicated to the various levels of command that it should only be black people who would be attacked because that is where the overwhelming majority of support lay for the government or for the ANC and the SACP alliance.  That is how it had been communicated during public meetings, in the media, in the press.</p>
<p class="line" id="line8"><a name="pos8"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTLAUNG:</span> Mr Prinsloo, I ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line9"><a name="pos9"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Would you agree Mr Prinsloo, that that would have been a very convenient explanation to avoid an allegation of racism against the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line10"><a name="pos10"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I hear what you're saying, but we felt the same way towards white ANC supporters, but because they constituted such a minority they were therefore very difficult to reach.  We wouldn't have had the same creation of a psychology of fear if we had pursued specifically those persons.</p>
<p class="line" id="line11"><a name="pos11"></a>	We had to chose soft targets and more specifically soft targets of another colour and in this case ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line12"><a name="pos12"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTLAUNG:</span> Mr Prinsloo, what I seem to understand and perhaps accept, is that most of the ANC/SACP alliance supporters are black, or were black but my question is actually whether there was a specific instruction that black people as such have to be attacked, by the "generale staf"</p>
<p class="line" id="line13"><a name="pos13"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, it had always been communicated that way.  It was specifically and pertinently stated as such on numerous occasions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line14"><a name="pos14"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That the attacks should be aimed at black people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line15"><a name="pos15"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line16"><a name="pos16"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Despite the fact that the ANC/SACP alliance comprised mostly black people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line17"><a name="pos17"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That's correct, because of the fact that black people constituted the major portion of the support for the ANC.</p>
<p class="line" id="line18"><a name="pos18"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The greatest amount of people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line19"><a name="pos19"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line20"><a name="pos20"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Might I just follow up on that please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line21"><a name="pos21"></a>	We've heard evidence that the AWB was positive towards Inkatha, Mangope and Bophuthatswana and probably other institutions of groups as well.  Weren't their supporters exclusively or even more exclusively black than the ANC/SACP support basis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line22"><a name="pos22"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I understand what you are saying but the fact of the matter remains that it would have been very difficult for us to, for example, determine in Germiston or in Johannesburg who would be which supporters.  We had narrow contact with certain other groups of other colour, we had to create that psychology of fear by hitting on soft targets.</p>
<p class="line" id="line23"><a name="pos23"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...[inaudible]</p>
<p class="line" id="line24"><a name="pos24"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The speaker's microphone is not on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line25"><a name="pos25"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...[inaudible] create this psychology of fear?</p>
<p class="line" id="line26"><a name="pos26"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line27"><a name="pos27"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What did the alliance have to do with it?  Why didn't you set off a bomb on a rugby field during a rugby match for example, or a cricket match or a soccer match?</p>
<p class="line" id="line28"><a name="pos28"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Chairperson, lives had to be taken pertinently.</p>
<p class="line" id="line29"><a name="pos29"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, well I'm speaking of a supposed incident that could take place during a sports match.</p>
<p class="line" id="line30"><a name="pos30"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well at that stage we had to be very cautious because we couldn't afford to be caught out.  At least the people who were to commit the acts were not to be caught out and this public gathering or any public gathering would have been very closely guarded.</p>
<p class="line" id="line31"><a name="pos31"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTLAUNG:</span> Mr Prinsloo, at some stage you were asked the question regarding the supporters of, for example, the Democratic Party that were in the election or participating in the election, and you gave the answer that they were rather too safe in the suburbs there, like Lower Houghton it seems.  Were you in fact giving the impression that were they not so safe you would have attacked them, despite the fact that they were white?</p>
<p class="line" id="line32"><a name="pos32"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I don't understand, could you just rephrase that please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line33"><a name="pos33"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTLAUNG:</span> I'm saying, at some stage when you were answering a question regarding the Democratic Party, and apparently within the context that one of your big aims was to stop the elections from proceeding.</p>
<p class="line" id="line34"><a name="pos34"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line35"><a name="pos35"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTLAUNG:</span> You were then asked a question: "What about the Democratic Party supporters because they had declared that they were going to participate in the elections, why didn't direct your bombs at them"?  And it seems to me your answer was: "They were too safe.  The police concentration in their area was so high that they were too safe there".  I'm then asking you, are you then intending to create the impression that if they were not safe because there were too many police there, you would still have attacked them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line36"><a name="pos36"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> If they weren't safe?</p>
<p class="line" id="line37"><a name="pos37"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTLAUNG:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line38"><a name="pos38"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I can't answer that question because I don't know what the circumstances would have been and the circumstances would have determined the modus operandi at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line39"><a name="pos39"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, I think that the aim of the question was to ask, had it not been for the protection which they would have had during the incidents, would you have considered planting bombs among them as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line40"><a name="pos40"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I believe that it would have been a consideration.</p>
<p class="line" id="line41"><a name="pos41"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTLAUNG:</span> You say that you believe it would have been considered, but it seems to me the "generale staf" was very clear in its instruction that black people were to be attacked and therefore the DP supporters wouldn't be involved, do you agree with me?  Inasfar as the attacks went.</p>
<p class="line" id="line42"><a name="pos42"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That's correct, because at that stage the necessary information which was available to us had been tabled and it would have been senseless or futile to us to move into such a well protected area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line43"><a name="pos43"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTLAUNG:</span> And one of the big aims too of this whole bomb trend was to twist the arm of the government isn't it, to stop the elections from proceeding?</p>
<p class="line" id="line44"><a name="pos44"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line45"><a name="pos45"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTLAUNG:</span> And by the government you mean the government of the National Party which was essentially white, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line46"><a name="pos46"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line47"><a name="pos47"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTLAUNG:</span> Would you agree with me that it would have made more impact on the government - and maybe if I pose this question, did you believe that the government of the day could stop the elections if it wanted to?  Assuming somehow you persuaded it to stop the elections from proceeding.</p>
<p class="line" id="line48"><a name="pos48"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, it could have.</p>
<p class="line" id="line49"><a name="pos49"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTLAUNG:</span> Would you then agree with me that if you had to bomb white suburbs for example, that would necessarily have had more impact on the government, in terms of persuading them from not proceeding with their actions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line50"><a name="pos50"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Right-wing groupings had a number of national offices in the Western Transvaal and elsewhere.</p>
<p class="line" id="line51"><a name="pos51"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTLAUNG:</span> Yes, but it seems to me you had learnt from history that by attacking things like offices or strictly military targets, the impact was not as efficient as on civilians?  Hadn't you learnt that lesson?</p>
<p class="line" id="line52"><a name="pos52"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> In order to create the psychology of fear and the anxiety around the election, in order to force people, not only the government but also the broader public, to stay away from the ballot boxes soft targets had to be attacked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line53"><a name="pos53"></a>	This had been proven to us by history that this type of modus operandi was very successful in the past.  The only MK's proved it, it worked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line54"><a name="pos54"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When you decided to use black people as targets, did you not think that black people at the first democratic elections would be afraid to go and vote?  Why did you have the impression that black people would be afraid of the right-wingers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line55"><a name="pos55"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> It's not as much the fact that they would be afraid of the right-wingers but we had to create the psychology of fear and the government had to take notice of it.  Whether we were successful in our purpose is something that I'm not very sure of, however the anxiety had been created at a certain stage by attacking soft targets.  We believed at a certain point during these bombings that it would be successful.</p>
<p class="line" id="line56"><a name="pos56"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That the black people would stay away from the ballot boxes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line57"><a name="pos57"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line58"><a name="pos58"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why, why did you think that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line59"><a name="pos59"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> We had hoped that somebody else would also stand up from other ranks and say: "Listen to these people, these people have to be accommodated somewhere within this new dispensation".  Well that was our hope.</p>
<p class="line" id="line60"><a name="pos60"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTLAUNG:</span> Mr Prinsloo, would you agree with me that there were certain innocent civilians that were killed or maimed during your explosions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line61"><a name="pos61"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line62"><a name="pos62"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTLAUNG:</span> I want to submit to you that you would sleep better if you have killed, through these explosives, innocent black civilians than if you were to kill innocent white civilians.  What do you say to that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line63"><a name="pos63"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> We were in a process of warfare, whites were killed indeed.  As it has been put, by means of attacks on soft targets we aimed to create the psychology of fear whether or not whites were involved, but the fact ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line64"><a name="pos64"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The speaker's microphone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line65"><a name="pos65"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> The fact that I would slept easier or not was not the major idea behind this for me, and I don't believe that that's the same with fellow members and accused.  I don't think that that is what it was about.</p>
<p class="line" id="line66"><a name="pos66"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You had the hope that somebody would stand up and say:  "We must listen to the right-wingers"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line67"><a name="pos67"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That's correct.  At that point we had hoped that it would be a prominent figure from within the current government who would stand up and say: "Okay, let's sit down and discuss it".</p>
<p class="line" id="line68"><a name="pos68"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...[inaudible]</p>
<p class="line" id="line69"><a name="pos69"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The speaker's microphone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line70"><a name="pos70"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> There has been evidence before us that at that stage there was an undertaking by the leader of the ANC at that time, he was also the leader of the alliance, he is the current State President, there was an undertaking that was given at that stage that he would appoint a committee to investigate this matter.  Do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line71"><a name="pos71"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I remember that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line72"><a name="pos72"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Wasn't it enough?</p>
<p class="line" id="line73"><a name="pos73"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Chairperson, that was after the Johannesburg bomb if I remember correctly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line74"><a name="pos74"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, I'm talking about the undertaking.  After the elections he passed the law and the committee was appointed.  I don't know about the level of progress that they had reached, but before the election an undertaking was given.</p>
<p class="line" id="line75"><a name="pos75"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Chairperson, whether or not the undertaking was given I would believe what you say, I accept that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line76"><a name="pos76"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well that has been the evidence of some of your fellow applicants.</p>
<p class="line" id="line77"><a name="pos77"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Chairperson, you must realise that at that stage the right-wingers, and specifically the AWB, in its alliance with the CP and other parties was not or at least I don't believe that they would have accepted something like that permanently from the committee.  Somebody would have had to do something effectively with immediacy, especially because of the fact that CODESA didn't work.  They had very little confident at that stage in any committee or in any group which had been compiled in order to deal with such an issue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line78"><a name="pos78"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> I'm sorry Mr Motlaung, because there's a bit of a delay on this I'd just like to follow up on that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line79"><a name="pos79"></a>	As a member of the generals staff, are you saying that you did not discuss a possible undertaking or the possibility of further talks just before the election, and I'm talking about your group as the general staff?</p>
<p class="line" id="line80"><a name="pos80"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No, not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line81"><a name="pos81"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> So you are saying, in all the strategic planning forums you had as the general staff and knowing that you wanted your Volkstaat, and from what you are saying you wanted to disrupt the elections, you did not consider the overtures or the approaches from the other side at all, however weak they may have been?</p>
<p class="line" id="line82"><a name="pos82"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well that would only have been a decision of the generals in staff and it would have been up to the political participants at that stage, Mr Terreblanche and his fellow political speakers.  They would have had to sit down and discuss it, which at that stage according to my information was never done.  Whether they did it or not would be impossible for me to answer, but my specific instructions were from the staff and I was to proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line83"><a name="pos83"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Just in terms of the structure I would just like to achieve some more clarity.  With regard to your final answer it would appear to me that the generals in staff didn't discuss politics but that Mr Terreblanche and others were responsible for politics, is that what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line84"><a name="pos84"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No, that's not what I'm saying at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line85"><a name="pos85"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Then why do you say: "I mean that Mr Terreblanche was the political stage persona"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line86"><a name="pos86"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> He was the person who held political discussions with other groups or other interested parties.  It wasn't the generals in staff who, for example, would enter the stage in order to make political statements.  It was discussed with the generals in staff beforehand in certain cases.</p>
<p class="line" id="line87"><a name="pos87"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But the entire issue of the Volkstaat Council, do you know whether or not that was discussed at generals and staff level?</p>
<p class="line" id="line88"><a name="pos88"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, it was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line89"><a name="pos89"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And were any decisions made?</p>
<p class="line" id="line90"><a name="pos90"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line91"><a name="pos91"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> What were the decisions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line92"><a name="pos92"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> With respect to the Volkstaat?</p>
<p class="line" id="line93"><a name="pos93"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> No, the Volkstaat Council.  The Chairperson has just said to you that overtures were made by Mr Mandela and at that stage the Volkstaat Council had already been written into law, and that is why General Viljoen moved over in order to participate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line94"><a name="pos94"></a>	The idea of the Volkstaat Council, which would be a committee which would have meetings in order to investigate the possibilities of establishing a Volkstaat.  Do you remember anything about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line95"><a name="pos95"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No, not at all because that was after the elections.</p>
<p class="line" id="line96"><a name="pos96"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Yes, it was compiled after the election but before then it had been written into law.</p>
<p class="line" id="line97"><a name="pos97"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> At the time of the bomb explosions and approximately one to two weeks before the time there had been absolutely no mention that we might be accommodated on a Volkstaat Council, it was only mentioned after the election.  We were invited to participate after the elections.</p>
<p class="line" id="line98"><a name="pos98"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> That's entirely correct that the invitation came after the elections but Mr Viljoen's participation in this was on the basis that part of the constitution would include the establishment of a Volkstaat Council which would begin to operate in terms of the constitution after the election.  Can't you remember anything about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line99"><a name="pos99"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I can't remember that specifically.</p>
<p class="line" id="line100"><a name="pos100"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Why did you think General Viljoen participated in the elections then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line101"><a name="pos101"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Power.</p>
<p class="line" id="line102"><a name="pos102"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Could you just repeat that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line103"><a name="pos103"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> In order to occupy a position of power, that is why he participated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line104"><a name="pos104"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did you still regard him as someone who was on your side or someone who was now against you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line105"><a name="pos105"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well at least a day or two before the elections or the evening before the elections we would determine that he was definitely going to participate and at that stage we hoped that this was only political talk but I personally - unfortunately I cannot speak on behalf of the applicants, but I personally viewed this as strictly some sort of trick which he was playing in order to occupy a position of power within the new dispensation which was to follow.</p>
<p class="line" id="line106"><a name="pos106"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you agree with that tactic?</p>
<p class="line" id="line107"><a name="pos107"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> General Viljoen's tactic?</p>
<p class="line" id="line108"><a name="pos108"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line109"><a name="pos109"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No, not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line110"><a name="pos110"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> As they saw it, that it was simply a ploy in order to occupy a position of power within the new dispensation, however he didn't really sell the right-wingers out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line111"><a name="pos111"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I don't really understand what you mean.</p>
<p class="line" id="line112"><a name="pos112"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> As I understand your evidence, you thought that he was still right-wing oriented, however he participated in the elections simply to occupy a position of power in the new dispensation so that he could continue with his right-wing politics.</p>
<p class="line" id="line113"><a name="pos113"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line114"><a name="pos114"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you believe him, did you think that that was the right thing to do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line115"><a name="pos115"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well it was too late by them.  There were those who believed, those who worked narrowly with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line116"><a name="pos116"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But when you realised that this was a possibility - let me put it to you this way, did you accept this as a tactic which was something that you could live with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line117"><a name="pos117"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> At that stage nobody who I knew trusted him.  The right-wingers on ground level at that stage didn't trust any right-wing leader anymore.</p>
<p class="line" id="line118"><a name="pos118"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So could he have been killed during the elections and if he had, would that have affected you at all?</p>
<p class="line" id="line119"><a name="pos119"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> He still enjoyed quite a bit of support and popularity amongst his army command members and large areas in the rural areas.  I don't know what the consequences of such an occurrence would have been.</p>
<p class="line" id="line120"><a name="pos120"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I beg your pardon, I just want to follow this up.</p>
<p class="line" id="line121"><a name="pos121"></a>	At that stage you said, if I heard you correctly, that the right-wingers on grassroots level didn't trust any right-wing leader anymore, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line122"><a name="pos122"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, on that evening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line123"><a name="pos123"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Before the election?</p>
<p class="line" id="line124"><a name="pos124"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That evening.  Well that is my personal view and that is what I picked from within the field.</p>
<p class="line" id="line125"><a name="pos125"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Was Mr Terreblanche one of those right-wing leaders who the right-wingers on grassroots level couldn't trust anymore?</p>
<p class="line" id="line126"><a name="pos126"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, to a certain extent.</p>
<p class="line" id="line127"><a name="pos127"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Were the generals in staff part of the right-wingers on grassroots level?</p>
<p class="line" id="line128"><a name="pos128"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> The generals in staff were definitely members of the right-wing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line129"><a name="pos129"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> On grassroots level?</p>
<p class="line" id="line130"><a name="pos130"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line131"><a name="pos131"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Are you trying to tell me or am I inferring that there was a split between the generals in staff and Mr Terreblanche, that there were tensions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line132"><a name="pos132"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> There was tension indeed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line133"><a name="pos133"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did the generals in staff determine the police of the AWB or attempt to determine the policy of the AWB from time to time, against Mr Terreblanche or what was the nature of the tension?</p>
<p class="line" id="line134"><a name="pos134"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Not in all cases.  Regarding the military it remained external.  What I mean by tensions is that there were political tensions, should attempts be made to negotiate or shouldn't there be attempts to negotiate, should we contact other groups or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line135"><a name="pos135"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Let's just take the issue of negotiation or not, you said that that was part of the political tensions between the generals in staff and Mr Terreblanche, who took up which opinion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line136"><a name="pos136"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Specifically with regard to negotiation, Constand Viljoen and Ferdie Hartzenberg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line137"><a name="pos137"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> No, I'm speaking about the generals in staff and Mr Terreblanche.  You said that there were tensions between the generals in staff and Mr Terreblanche and you said that these were political tensions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line138"><a name="pos138"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line139"><a name="pos139"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And then I asked you about the nature thereof and you said that one of the issues was to negotiate or not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line140"><a name="pos140"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line141"><a name="pos141"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did the generals in staff have a different position to Mr Terreblanche regarding this issue?</p>
<p class="line" id="line142"><a name="pos142"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> When I mentioned negotiation I meant that at that stage we were reassured by General Viljoen that large numbers of his army command or former army command supporters in the rural areas, and more specifically in Western Transvaal, would have wholeheartedly supported us and the other means which were promised to us, it was assured to us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line143"><a name="pos143"></a>	At that stage during the elections or the day before that or the evening before that, it was no longer certain, the certainty wasn't there anymore, whether we could still rely on his promises.  That is where the tension was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line144"><a name="pos144"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Were you angry at Mr Terreblanche because he wasn't sure?  What was the nature of the tension between the generals in staff and Mr Terreblanche?  Did you blame him because you were not certain about the support of Viljoen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line145"><a name="pos145"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No, ...[end of tape]</p>
<p class="line" id="line146"><a name="pos146"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> ...[inaudible] the tensions between the generals in staff, leave Viljoen out of this, what was the differences between the generals in staff and the leader, Mr Terreblanche that created this tension?</p>
<p class="line" id="line147"><a name="pos147"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> You must realise that at that stage I just moved in and out between the game farm, the members, ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line148"><a name="pos148"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> No, no, Mr Prinsloo, you are talking about tension between the generals in staff and Mr Terreblanche and you had knowledge of this otherwise you would not have mentioned this.  What was the reason for this tension?</p>
<p class="line" id="line149"><a name="pos149"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Sometimes there were small things, for example, if a person would co-operate with a leader of another group or the availability of logistics and equipment, then he would deny it or disapprove, then it had to be discussed by the generals in staff, and that is where the tension was created at certain times.</p>
<p class="line" id="line150"><a name="pos150"></a>	The right-wing was also afraid because they knew that some of the members and the applicants, the people were scared.  They knew that there were arrests to come ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line151"><a name="pos151"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> At that stage did the generals in staff not trust Mr Terreblanche anymore?  Were they not satisfies with his judgement, is that what you're saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line152"><a name="pos152"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No, not at all, it's not that.  I believe that in any para-military movement there would always be tension in a war situation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line153"><a name="pos153"></a><span class="speaker">MR NEL:</span> Between the head of the military unit and its soldiers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line154"><a name="pos154"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line155"><a name="pos155"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Do you honestly believe it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line156"><a name="pos156"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, I was in the Defence Force.</p>
<p class="line" id="line157"><a name="pos157"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Was there tension between you and General Viljoen or General Meiring or whoever?</p>
<p class="line" id="line158"><a name="pos158"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> One cannot always agree with a general or commander or brigadier's viewpoint, with regards to an instruction or an operation that had to be executed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line159"><a name="pos159"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> i'm going to ask the last question concerning this and then I'm going to leave it there.  What you are talking about now, about men that do not agree is not, you cannot compare this, we are talking about the top structure in this para-military unit, the AWB.   Where there was tension between the leader and this top-level structure.  That is what you've told us.  In other words the tension is amongst the generals in staff as a body and the leader.</p>
<p class="line" id="line160"><a name="pos160"></a>	For the last time, would you like to try and explain to us what the nature of this tension was?  It means that the generals in staff had a view of something and where the leader had a different view.  This is how I read you, otherwise I'm reading you completely incorrectly.</p>
<p class="line" id="line161"><a name="pos161"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> It was just that - let us state an example, if we wanted Mr Terreblanche to make contact with Mr Hartzenberg or Viljoen and he said no, he is not interested in it, then some people in the generals in staff would then have said: "But why, what is the reason, let us discuss this".  I am talking about that tension that sometimes appeared.</p>
<p class="line" id="line162"><a name="pos162"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I would like to make a last statement and then ask for your comment.  The three, four days before the elections the generals in staff decided to create this psychosis of fear, Mr Terreblanche was not part of that decision, he did not know about it.  Your comment on that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line163"><a name="pos163"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That is not the truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line164"><a name="pos164"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTLAUNG:</span> Mr Prinsloo, it is your evidence that you were a generals in staff member of equal standing as any other member thereof, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line165"><a name="pos165"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Another member of the generals in staff?  I was in the same rank structure as the other members of the generals in staff.  Was that a question?</p>
<p class="line" id="line166"><a name="pos166"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTLAUNG:</span> Yes, that is correct.  There was no-one above you in the "generale staf"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line167"><a name="pos167"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No, there was kommandant general.</p>
<p class="line" id="line168"><a name="pos168"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTLAUNG:</span> Yes, but the kommandant general was not a member of the, he was a member of the general's staff but he actually acquired that title from the wen kommando, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line169"><a name="pos169"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, he comes from the ranks of the wen kommando.</p>
<p class="line" id="line170"><a name="pos170"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTLAUNG:</span> So as far as the generale staf itself was concerned, he didn't assume any higher position than all the other members of the generale staf, correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line171"><a name="pos171"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line172"><a name="pos172"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTLAUNG:</span> So in terms of your para-military structuring, why would you have to take instructions, not from the general "generale staf" but from a member, only one member of the generale staf, like General Ackerman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line173"><a name="pos173"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> He's already testified because Ackerman was a kommandant general.</p>
<p class="line" id="line174"><a name="pos174"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That is correct Mr Chairman, but it seems to me what Mr Nico Prinsloo is saying is that despite the fact that he had this better title in respect of the wen kommando, that was not necessarily the case that he had a better title in the generale staf, correct?  In the generale staf he was one of the generals, that's the bottom line.</p>
<p class="line" id="line175"><a name="pos175"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Me myself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line176"><a name="pos176"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTLAUNG:</span> Pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line177"><a name="pos177"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Mr Ackerman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line178"><a name="pos178"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTLAUNG:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line179"><a name="pos179"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line180"><a name="pos180"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTLAUNG:</span> Let me put it this way, would you take instructions from the wen kommando, you as a member of the ystergarde?</p>
<p class="line" id="line181"><a name="pos181"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No, I was from the wen kommando, I was a member of the wen kommando.</p>
<p class="line" id="line182"><a name="pos182"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTLAUNG:</span> Were you a member of the wen kommando?</p>
<p class="line" id="line183"><a name="pos183"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line184"><a name="pos184"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTLAUNG:</span> And the instructions relating to the bombings, did they come from the wen kommando or from the ystergarde?</p>
<p class="line" id="line185"><a name="pos185"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> From the generals in staff of the wen kommando on which members of the ystergarde also served.</p>
<p class="line" id="line186"><a name="pos186"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTLAUNG:</span> So the generale staf was actually a level within the wen kommando and not within the ystergarde?</p>
<p class="line" id="line187"><a name="pos187"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> They were in charge of the ystergarde, that is now the generals in staff as well as the wen kommando and all other sections or sub-sections of the AWB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line188"><a name="pos188"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> The generale staf is the overarching authority of the whole movement under which the two legs moved out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line189"><a name="pos189"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTLAUNG:</span> I see, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line190"><a name="pos190"></a>	Now tell me, did the generale staf at any stage take a decision that there will be trailer bombs used?</p>
<p class="line" id="line191"><a name="pos191"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line192"><a name="pos192"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTLAUNG:</span> Did it ever agree that the pipe bombs will be used?</p>
<p class="line" id="line193"><a name="pos193"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, they did have knowledge about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line194"><a name="pos194"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTLAUNG:</span> But they never knew that anybody intended to plant trailer bombs, that's what you are saying?</p>
<p class="line" id="line195"><a name="pos195"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, but then I would like to correct it.  In the construction and the building of what the bomb would look like, that was left to the discretion of the person who actually built it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line196"><a name="pos196"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTLAUNG:</span> Let's talk about the Germiston bomb.  Do you still stand by what you said yesterday, that you can't remember where it was discussed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line197"><a name="pos197"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I never said that I could not remember where it was specifically.  Can you just take me back to that piece of evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line198"><a name="pos198"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTLAUNG:</span> Yes.  You were asked where was this discussed, was in the "geslote vergadering of in die openbare vergadering", and you then you said you could not remember.  Can you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line199"><a name="pos199"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> The closed meeting was in the cubicles, the open or public meeting that you are talking about, where was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line200"><a name="pos200"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTLAUNG:</span> I don't know but I understood that there was two types of meetings, the closed one and the open one, is it not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line201"><a name="pos201"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, I spoke or took it up with Mr Barnard, the fact concerning the trailer.  I then asked Mr de Wet if he would be willing to make his vehicle available with the towbar because it will be able to tow this trailer.  I sent him on a mission that he at that stage did not know what it was about.  I sent him to Koesterfontein.</p>
<p class="line" id="line202"><a name="pos202"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTLAUNG:</span> But you can't say whether this was one of those closed meetings or not, where the discussion about the Germiston bomb took place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line203"><a name="pos203"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, I discussed it with Mr Barnard.</p>
<p class="line" id="line204"><a name="pos204"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTLAUNG:</span> It was only the two of you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line205"><a name="pos205"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> There were other members present as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line206"><a name="pos206"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTLAUNG:</span> Was it a closed meeting this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line207"><a name="pos207"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line208"><a name="pos208"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTLAUNG:</span> How many people ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line209"><a name="pos209"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, if you call it that it was a close meeting because it wasn't discussed with everybody, that is why it was a closed meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line210"><a name="pos210"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who was present when this was discussed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line211"><a name="pos211"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> If I remember correctly it was myself, Mr Barnard, I speak under correction but I think, Mr van der Merwe, Leon van der Merwe, Mr Myburgh, I think that was it but I speak under correction, I'm not quite sure.</p>
<p class="line" id="line212"><a name="pos212"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTLAUNG:</span> Was there a specific commander for that mission, or were you the commander?</p>
<p class="line" id="line213"><a name="pos213"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> What mission?</p>
<p class="line" id="line214"><a name="pos214"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTLAUNG:</span> The Germiston trailer mission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line215"><a name="pos215"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line216"><a name="pos216"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTLAUNG:</span> There was no commander for that mission?</p>
<p class="line" id="line217"><a name="pos217"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well, Mr Barnard was in charge of the building of the bomb and Mr Koekemoer and Mr Myburgh, the Koesterfontein people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line218"><a name="pos218"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTLAUNG:</span> Yes, for the construction of the bomb.  I'm talking about the implementation, the execution of the mission.  Was there a commander for that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line219"><a name="pos219"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That would have been Mr de Wet.</p>
<p class="line" id="line220"><a name="pos220"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTLAUNG:</span> Did you tell him exactly where to go and plant the bomb, yourself?</p>
<p class="line" id="line221"><a name="pos221"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> It was up to the discretion of the person who was sent to a certain area.  The person would have been chosen to go and plant a bomb in a town.  He had to know the area, the town, he had to know all the exit and entrance routes or then familiarise himself with them.  A person would never go to a place, to a town, which he or she doesn't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line222"><a name="pos222"></a>	I gave Mr de Wet the instruction to go to Koesterfontein where he then further would be informed about what the next steps would be in the execution of this instruction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line223"><a name="pos223"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTLAUNG:</span> And who was to give him further instructions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line224"><a name="pos224"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line225"><a name="pos225"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTLAUNG:</span> Who was to give him further instructions at Koesterfontein?</p>
<p class="line" id="line226"><a name="pos226"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> He would then be schooled there in what to do further.</p>
<p class="line" id="line227"><a name="pos227"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTLAUNG:</span> By whom?</p>
<p class="line" id="line228"><a name="pos228"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I wasn't at Koesterfontein, I do not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line229"><a name="pos229"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTLAUNG:</span> According to your expectations.</p>
<p class="line" id="line230"><a name="pos230"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> It might have been Mr Myburgh or Mr Barnard or Mr Koekemoer.  You must realise it had to be detonated by the occupants of the vehicle and he had to be informed as to how to do this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line231"><a name="pos231"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who was the person who sat a map table and organised this whole war?  Without planting a bomb, to look on a map and say this is what happened, this is the next step, who was that person?</p>
<p class="line" id="line232"><a name="pos232"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Mr Chairperson, there wasn't such a specific person, the whole generals in staff had to give the instructions that there would be a countrywide attack.  They would never allow one person to run this war or to give all the instructions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line233"><a name="pos233"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You see, history shows us that in any war many things do not go according to plan.</p>
<p class="line" id="line234"><a name="pos234"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line235"><a name="pos235"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> There are things that people do not foresee and then certain decisions had to be taken to rectify this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line236"><a name="pos236"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line237"><a name="pos237"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> As far as I know history there is always a general or someone who was in contact with grassroots level to see that everything was going according to plan or a change of plan or whatever, and you say that as far as your knowledge goes in this war there was not such a person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line238"><a name="pos238"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No, what I meant by that was that the general who was in charge of his area had to, in consultation with his commanders, ensure that the instructions of the generals in staff are executed.  For example, in Koesterfontein, according to my discretion, Mr Barnard, Cliff Barnard would have been in control.  A that specific moment or the period when Mr de Wet arrived there, I say that I assume that Mr Barnard would take the lead or command or then inform him or school him into as to what he must do.</p>
<p class="line" id="line239"><a name="pos239"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTLAUNG:</span> Tell me, these bomb explosions, were they planned for execution only from the Western Transvaal or countrywide?</p>
<p class="line" id="line240"><a name="pos240"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Countrywide.</p>
<p class="line" id="line241"><a name="pos241"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTLAUNG:</span> Did any take place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line242"><a name="pos242"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, there were explosions in the Free State, in Natal and members were arrested who were on a mission to plant a bomb in the Eastern Cape.</p>
<p class="line" id="line243"><a name="pos243"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTLAUNG:</span> And as far as the generale staf members who visited you after the Germiston, not the Germiston, the Johannesburg bomb went off, why were they specifically there, why did they visit?</p>
<p class="line" id="line244"><a name="pos244"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Because I did not have communication with the other areas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line245"><a name="pos245"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTLAUNG:</span> Didn't they visit you so that they could say whether they support what happened in Johannesburg or they don't?</p>
<p class="line" id="line246"><a name="pos246"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, amongst others but I sent a message through that I do not receive any communication and my communication was cut down with the other areas.  At that stage I realised that they had communication with each other and that is why I had to drive to and fro in order to get messages and I left a message telling them that they must come and see me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line247"><a name="pos247"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTLAUNG:</span> You see because it's a bit strange for me.  If it was part of the plan to the knowledge of the general staf, that bomb would go off like the one in Johannesburg, why would they have to say whether they agree with what happened or they don't?</p>
<p class="line" id="line248"><a name="pos248"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well the generals in staff operated in that fashion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line249"><a name="pos249"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTLAUNG:</span> Okay. And as far as the Johannesburg bomb, you were specifically told by General Ackerman to go and plant that one?</p>
<p class="line" id="line250"><a name="pos250"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line251"><a name="pos251"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTLAUNG:</span> The Germiston one, were you specifically told by anyone to do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line252"><a name="pos252"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No, it was explained in our briefings with our different commanders that a bomb had to go out but not specifically a trailer bomb.</p>
<p class="line" id="line253"><a name="pos253"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did they say where that bomb had to be planted?</p>
<p class="line" id="line254"><a name="pos254"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, it was in Germiston but it was not specifically said but they said it had to be a soft target.</p>
<p class="line" id="line255"><a name="pos255"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who made the decision that the bomb had to be planted in Germiston close to or in a taxi rank?</p>
<p class="line" id="line256"><a name="pos256"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> It was done, the decisions were made by the generals in staff.</p>
<p class="line" id="line257"><a name="pos257"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, the generals in staff did not say that it had to go to a taxi rank, who decided that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line258"><a name="pos258"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> It was explained that soft targets had to be targeted, amongst others, taxi ranks, restaurants, everywhere where large groups of people would be gathered.</p>
<p class="line" id="line259"><a name="pos259"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was there a restaurant that was blown up?</p>
<p class="line" id="line260"><a name="pos260"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line261"><a name="pos261"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Where?</p>
<p class="line" id="line262"><a name="pos262"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That was in Pretoria.</p>
<p class="line" id="line263"><a name="pos263"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTLAUNG:</span> And lastly, tell me ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line264"><a name="pos264"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Sorry, Mr Motlaung, just to follow up on that point.</p>
<p class="line" id="line265"><a name="pos265"></a>	I understood the question to relate to orders or discussions at general staff level about all the other bombs, not the first bomb, the Johannesburg bomb.  And this is probably where I have a difficulty because I don't quite understand your answer.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line266"><a name="pos266"></a>	Your answer says you discussed the Germiston bomb with your commanders, now am I correct to think that your commanders were your chaps who were on the farm with you, is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line267"><a name="pos267"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That's correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line268"><a name="pos268"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Right.  Now let's go back above those commanders, yourself and those commanders, to the general staff.  My difficulty remains, the discussion on all the other bombs that went off, because I understood you to say in your evidence in chief, that  you were instructed by Ackerman to prepare one bomb that was going to go off in Johannesburg, where the instruction or the discussion on all the other bombs fits into the general staff's general ideas to what was going to happen, I'm not too sure.  Can you help me there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line269"><a name="pos269"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line270"><a name="pos270"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> You seem to have operated on your own, this is why I'd like clarity, viz-a-viz all the other bombs barr the Bree Street bomb, am I wrong?</p>
<p class="line" id="line271"><a name="pos271"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, you are wrong.</p>
<p class="line" id="line272"><a name="pos272"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Thank you.  Help me with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line273"><a name="pos273"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> The specific area for which we were responsible was indicated to us as well as to all the other generals in staff.  My area of operation would be the PWV area.  We had to create chaos and a psychosis of fear in this area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line274"><a name="pos274"></a>	Concerning the Germiston bomb, we had to get one person from the members or a volunteer who knew the area and who would then go and plant this bomb and detonate it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line275"><a name="pos275"></a>	There was not specifically discussed in generals in staff meetings that it had to go to Germiston in this street at the taxi rank.  I was just said that it had to be in the East Rand/West Rand areas.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line276"><a name="pos276"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> When did they say this, the generals in staff?</p>
<p class="line" id="line277"><a name="pos277"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That was before I left for the game farm, in that period, that week or so, it could have been a week or two weeks.  We always had long discussions, we always discussed this at the staff meetings, in this period that went before the elections.</p>
<p class="line" id="line278"><a name="pos278"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Why then did Ackerman have to specifically talk to you about the Johannesburg bomb if nobody else specifically talked to you about all the other bombings and these were decisions that had been taken at that general staff level?  Just help me on that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line279"><a name="pos279"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That had to be the trigger to everything else, this one big bomb that had to go off first.  That is how I see it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line280"><a name="pos280"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> But that doesn't answer my question about the distinction between that one bomb and all the others, because you were given a specific instruction on one particular bomb, why not with all the others?  Why didn't you then wait for somebody to come and say: "Right, let's go with the rest"?  I don't quite understand why they singled out the Johannesburg bomb and gave you a specific instruction and didn't single out all the other incidents with similar specific instructions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line281"><a name="pos281"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> You see like I said earlier on, we had our area.  This Johannesburg bomb had to be the trigger which started everything off.  The people who were sent out - I had my instructions that the West Rand and East Rand areas had to be attacked, what towns had to be chosen we discussed, myself and the commanders and we agreed that a person had to be sent to, for example Germiston or Pretoria.</p>
<p class="line" id="line282"><a name="pos282"></a>	During the visits of the generals in staff, it always had their approval as well as my reports at Ventersdorp.</p>
<p class="line" id="line283"><a name="pos283"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTLAUNG:</span> Mr Prinsloo, the last point.  Can you tell me, did you want the citizens of this country and the international community to know that it was you people, particularly from the AWB, who were busy with these bombs and why you were busy with these bombs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line284"><a name="pos284"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, at that stage we felt that we are acting on behalf of all other right-wing whites in South Africa because we also had the support of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line285"><a name="pos285"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why did you never after the bombs make public statements, taking responsibility for them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line286"><a name="pos286"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Mr Chairperson, at that stage, or history taught us that not even the Boere Kommandos could stand together.  We thought that history would never repeat itself but it was then proved that it will repeat because whites cannot stand together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line287"><a name="pos287"></a>	It was proved again, these people never had the support of any right-wing group, right-wing leaders only did this later on in order to create a perfect platform for themselves.</p>
<p class="line" id="line288"><a name="pos288"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Let us continue then.  How would Mandela have known or FW de Klerk have known that they had to do something about the Volkstaat of no-one told him that these bombs were detonated for this reason?</p>
<p class="line" id="line289"><a name="pos289"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Mr Mandela told him that he must establish such a council.</p>
<p class="line" id="line290"><a name="pos290"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But the government who had to announce this Volkstaat for the right-wing, who would have told the government that: "We are detonating these bombs because we are looking for a Volkstaat"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line291"><a name="pos291"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well it had to be our right-wing leaders who had to do this, it was their responsibility.</p>
<p class="line" id="line292"><a name="pos292"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can you not say why it was never done?</p>
<p class="line" id="line293"><a name="pos293"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> They were scared that they would then  ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line294"><a name="pos294"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But Mr Prinsloo, then it doesn't make sense to me.  The end of this plan was to create this fear and to plant these bombs and to take the lives of people, the goal had to be that someone must tell the government that this is the reason otherwise it is useless in taking people's lives.</p>
<p class="line" id="line295"><a name="pos295"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line296"><a name="pos296"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now who according to the plan had to go and tell the government that this is the reason and: "Give us a Volkstaat, otherwise something else would happen"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line297"><a name="pos297"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That would be Mr Terreblanche.</p>
<p class="line" id="line298"><a name="pos298"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was that according to plan?</p>
<p class="line" id="line299"><a name="pos299"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes and Dr Ferdie Hartzenberg had to make the announcements nationally and internationally according to secession.</p>
<p class="line" id="line300"><a name="pos300"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Therefore I assume that both leaders whom you've just mentioned knew what was going on, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line301"><a name="pos301"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, with General Constand Viljoen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line302"><a name="pos302"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line303"><a name="pos303"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Together with General Constand Viljoen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line304"><a name="pos304"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And Constand Viljoen knew on the day of the elections, who it was and what was going on?</p>
<p class="line" id="line305"><a name="pos305"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> He knew who it was, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line306"><a name="pos306"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why did the generals in staff not go to Mr Terreblanch and tell him: "Make your public announcement that we did it and this is our reason"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line307"><a name="pos307"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Mr Chairperson, according to my perception and my co-commanders, they were too scared to do it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line308"><a name="pos308"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I'm now talking of the generals in staff.</p>
<p class="line" id="line309"><a name="pos309"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Then they would ...[end of tape]</p>
<p class="line" id="line310"><a name="pos310"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> ...[inaudible] or did the planning. You knew that this was a risk.</p>
<p class="line" id="line311"><a name="pos311"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes. That is what we could not understand, why he did not do it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line312"><a name="pos312"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you knew that you were going to plant and that lives may be lost and that there will be a lot of noise.  "Because we are looking for a Volkstaat and at the end of the day the leader certainly had to, whoever it was, make a public statement and say; This is the reason and give us a Volkstaat."  And that is the most important, the goal of the whole operation was the most important aspect. Is that not true?</p>
<p class="line" id="line313"><a name="pos313"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, that is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line314"><a name="pos314"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now can you then tell us why the most important point of this whole operation, people sold their houses, left their jobs for this Volkstaat and the most important item of the whole agenda was not executed. Why not? All those things that the people did taking their families with them, selling their stuff, took the lives of other people it was all useless. How so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line315"><a name="pos315"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That is how we saw it as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line316"><a name="pos316"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I ask again. The Generals in staff according to the evidence that we have heard were a very powerful body.</p>
<p class="line" id="line317"><a name="pos317"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line318"><a name="pos318"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why didn't they go to Terreblanch and say: "Look now the goal of this plan go and execute it" Or why wasn't it executed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line319"><a name="pos319"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I believe that requests were directed at him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line320"><a name="pos320"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But Mr Prinsloo you were the secretary, you have to know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line321"><a name="pos321"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Mr Chairperson I was then in Protea prison in Soweto. At that stage we did not have any contact with the outside world.</p>
<p class="line" id="line322"><a name="pos322"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You were arrested on the day after the elections. That was the 28th.</p>
<p class="line" id="line323"><a name="pos323"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes that is correct. On the day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line324"><a name="pos324"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> On the day. The first bomb in Bree Street was on the 25th or the 24th.</p>
<p class="line" id="line325"><a name="pos325"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> The Sunday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line326"><a name="pos326"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why on that day didn't you go to Terreblanch or the on the 26th and say: "Go and tell the people that is part of our plan. They must know why we are detonating these bombs. Why people lost their lives. Go and talk to them."</p>
<p class="line" id="line327"><a name="pos327"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> They had to do that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line328"><a name="pos328"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, I know that they had to do this and that they didn't do it. Why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line329"><a name="pos329"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well it is my view that they were afraid prosecutions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line330"><a name="pos330"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But they were aware before the first bomb that this was a possibility and part of the plan was that a public statement was supposed to be made. That was before the first bomb.</p>
<p class="line" id="line331"><a name="pos331"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line332"><a name="pos332"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And lives were taken, buildings were blown up. So isn't there any reason that we can determine as to why this wasn't done?</p>
<p class="line" id="line333"><a name="pos333"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well I can't say why Mr Terreblanche didn't do it. He was supposed to have done it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line334"><a name="pos334"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Look I can understand that you can't say but could you perhaps tell us why the Generals in staff didn't go and tell him: "Look go and talk to the people"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line335"><a name="pos335"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Mr Chairman, sorry, I don't want to interpose. Mr Chairman, Exhibit F was handed in to the Committee and that certainly possibly the Chairman would like to just to refresh your memory.</p>
<p class="line" id="line336"><a name="pos336"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No I am aware of that. I want to find out what the inner workings of this Generale staf was and what their reasons were for not asking at least why it hadn't been done.</p>
<p class="line" id="line337"><a name="pos337"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Chairperson it could be possible that members of the staff approached Mr Terreblanche and directed such a request at him. I think that it is highly possible. I don't know about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line338"><a name="pos338"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But how could you not know? You were his secretary. You were very close to him. Why didn't you yourself ask him: "Mr Terreblanche why don't you speak out so that the whole world can hear if bombs are going off and claiming the lives of people, blowing up cars and buildings?"</p>
<p class="line" id="line339"><a name="pos339"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I can understand what you are saying but at that stage I was no longer involved with the secretariat or administration component. It was a very difficult time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line340"><a name="pos340"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well let's just forget about the position of secretary. You were next to Terreblanche. In other words you could have gone to him. Isn't that true? It was during your career and the construction of the entire operation that you were the secretary.</p>
<p class="line" id="line341"><a name="pos341"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line342"><a name="pos342"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you could have gone to him at least on a friendly basis and said to him. So that last point is the most important point and it is your duty to carry out your tasks. Why didn't you do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line343"><a name="pos343"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> He was supposed to have done it out of his own.</p>
<p class="line" id="line344"><a name="pos344"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But he didn't and why didn't you go and ask him: "Why not? " Or "When are you going to do it?" Or "Are you going to do it?"</p>
<p class="line" id="line345"><a name="pos345"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> We assumed that he would. We have always believed that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line346"><a name="pos346"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> After the first bomb he didn't do it. After the second, after the pipe bombs he didn't do it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line347"><a name="pos347"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line348"><a name="pos348"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> After a trailer bomb in Germiston he didn't do it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line349"><a name="pos349"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line350"><a name="pos350"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well at that stage a lot of bombs had gone off, peoples' lives had been lost, buildings had been affected, why not then? Most of the operations had been completed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line351"><a name="pos351"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> In my opinion Mr Terreblanche wanted to prove that the right-wingers and specifically the AWB could achieve precisely the same as for example the ANC soldiers of that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line352"><a name="pos352"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Prinsloo I am not asking why Terreblanche didn't do it or why he didn't perform his duties. He can come and tell us that himself if he wanted to and I am not expecting of you to give evidence regarding that. I am asking why the Generals in staff or you yourself who was close to him didn't ask him or remind him that he was supposed to do this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line353"><a name="pos353"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I can't say with certainty whether or not I discussed it with him. If I had to say that I indeed did discuss something like this with him such as going to the press and specifically mentioning that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line354"><a name="pos354"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But that would have been the most important aspect  of the entire operation. Why are you saying that you can't remember whether or not you discussed it with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line355"><a name="pos355"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> There were hundreds of people from the press on a daily basis in Ventersdorp and perhaps he did do this to a certain extent but I can't remember anything.</p>
<p class="line" id="line356"><a name="pos356"></a><span class="speaker">MR MOTLAUNG:</span> Look in conclusion I put it to you that particularly because as you say there were hundreds of press people there - I put it to you that it was never done because what happened about these bombs was a frolic by a small grouping apparently including yourself which knew that these were pure acts of criminality which you didn't have the blessing of the AWB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line357"><a name="pos357"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> You are entirely incorrect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line358"><a name="pos358"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR MOTLAUNG</p>
<p class="line" id="line359"><a name="pos359"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Chairperson I would just like to follow this up. I find it difficult and I will be direct with you regarding this. I know that you are aware of what you need to convince me in order for me to believe your evidence that Mr Terreblanche has to accept responsibility on behalf of the AWB, the entire history and all the exhibits also points to a different pattern. It points to a series of bomb explosions - whether these be explosions during which people are killed, injured or maimed or at industrial places, offices and other such buildings and then we have the political speeches of Mr Terreblanche in which he makes direct or indirect threats and he says: "If there is no Volkstaat (and I am referring specifically to exhibit c) then this pattern will continue." Exhibit f, sorry. In the last paragraph of that exhibit there is a short article and in that he says: "All hell will break  loose," and not he or Dr Hartenzenberg will be able to prevent it. In other words the policy was to achieve actual distance from that which was happening while the entire perception was that the right-wingers were actually the ones who were busy with it and your evidence now that you want the AWB to stand up like a man and be counted - if you will excuse my archaic language, is evidence which I cannot believe. The AWB did not want to stand up like a man and directly accept the responsibility for their actions. They did not even want to in an anonymous or indirect fashion tell the media that the AWB was responsible for these actions. It just wasn't their style.  Actually the AWB was a bunch of sissies who could not accept responsibility for their deeds and their policy. What is your commentary regarding that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line360"><a name="pos360"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> The perception had been created I believe after the Bophutatswana incident that the media would have alleged that the right-wingers had fled.</p>
<p class="line" id="line361"><a name="pos361"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> No, I am not talking of that. I am talking about responsibility for actions. Taking responsibility in public for deeds which is what according to you was expected and history has proven exactly the opposite.</p>
<p class="line" id="line362"><a name="pos362"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> They definitely should have taken responsibility for the actions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line363"><a name="pos363"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Yes, but "they" is you. This is ambivalent. Couldn't you have stood up and said: "I, Prinsloo, accept responsibility for all these actions on behalf of the AWB. I am on the second level of command."</p>
<p class="line" id="line364"><a name="pos364"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Those were not my duties Mr Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line365"><a name="pos365"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr Bracher have you got any questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line366"><a name="pos366"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR BRACHER:</span> Mr Prinsloo what is your present occupation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line367"><a name="pos367"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I work for myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line368"><a name="pos368"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Are you a farmer?</p>
<p class="line" id="line369"><a name="pos369"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes I also farm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line370"><a name="pos370"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Where do you work?</p>
<p class="line" id="line371"><a name="pos371"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I beg your pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line372"><a name="pos372"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Where do you work?</p>
<p class="line" id="line373"><a name="pos373"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I worked for the AWB and I work for myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line374"><a name="pos374"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> What do you do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line375"><a name="pos375"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I sell insurance.</p>
<p class="line" id="line376"><a name="pos376"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> In what town?</p>
<p class="line" id="line377"><a name="pos377"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> And I farm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line378"><a name="pos378"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Yesterday you were asked by the Chairman whether you would be prepared to participate in the reconciliation process and try and do something for the victims and you indicated that you would. Do you remember that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line379"><a name="pos379"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line380"><a name="pos380"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Would you be prepared in civil proceedings to give evidence on their behalf to the effect that these bombs were under the command of the leaders of the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line381"><a name="pos381"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I was consulted by my legal counsel to accept no sentences or participate in that. It should be taken up with them. I can't respond to that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line382"><a name="pos382"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Okay. Now I want to go to the structures in the General staff. We watched yesterday a video which had something if I recall the spirit of Majuba where it was proudly said you were going to fight battles over the barrel of a gun in the spirit of Majuba. Now when did the principles of the AWB or the policy of the AWB change from that to soft targets and killing innocent civilians?</p>
<p class="line" id="line383"><a name="pos383"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That was the order that went out to attack soft targets. As I have previously given evidence history taught us that it was sufficient to create a psychology of fear and angst amongst the public.</p>
<p class="line" id="line384"><a name="pos384"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Yes I understand that but I want to know when. You see the 2nd of April you have got marching soldiers, barrel of a gun, Majuba, Israelites fighting wars and in between that and the election there is a change of policy. You are now soft targets, innocent civilians, hiding away behind denials. At what meeting did the AWB General staff decide to change their policy?</p>
<p class="line" id="line385"><a name="pos385"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> It had always been the objective or the modus operandi of the various instructors to establish special units which could wage war because we knew that at a certain point in time the ANC/SACP alliance would lodge an attempt to take over the country and to become the new government.</p>
<p class="line" id="line386"><a name="pos386"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But the question is aimed at asking you when the policy of the AWB changed into terrorism?</p>
<p class="line" id="line387"><a name="pos387"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Chairperson I can't say with certainty on which day or during which month this specific event took place but I believe that it has always been that way. The fact that they mentioned the barrel of a gun was more by means of speech, metaphorically speaking. That idea had always been there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line388"><a name="pos388"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well, at least it sounds like bravery.</p>
<p class="line" id="line389"><a name="pos389"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line390"><a name="pos390"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Let me put it more specifically. When was the meeting at which it was decided that you would plant bombs at taxi ranks and restaurants and other targets where there would be a majority of black people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line391"><a name="pos391"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Do you want to know when this took place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line392"><a name="pos392"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line393"><a name="pos393"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well that was quite some time before the election and this was discussed at certain occasions. I can't tell you that this took place during a specific meeting. All I know is that it took place over a period of time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line394"><a name="pos394"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> When was it decided that generals will go out to their regions and tell people to actually plant bombs at taxi ranks at restaurants? Decided by the General staff?</p>
<p class="line" id="line395"><a name="pos395"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line396"><a name="pos396"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> When was that decision made?</p>
<p class="line" id="line397"><a name="pos397"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> It was in the period of time preceding the elections. I can't say specifically during which meeting this took place. What was done at the Trimpark meeting and before that - this was the final stage, we were in the final stage of preparation and the medical corps, the logistic corps and the air wing, all of them had to be in place at the time of the Trimpark conference and at that stage the Generals in staff as well as their 2 IV's pertinently knew what was expected of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line398"><a name="pos398"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> You see I am not talking about preparation, I am not talking about planning. I am talking about implementation. Presumably when you got an order to go and plant bombs in taxi ranks and restaurants and other black targets you would have gone out and done it immediately. Was it within the week before the election that, that decision was made by the General staff at head-office?</p>
<p class="line" id="line399"><a name="pos399"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> The person on the ground level who would have received such an order would have received that order from the Generals in staff via his commanders on a specific and given point in time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line400"><a name="pos400"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How old was that decision before it was carried out?</p>
<p class="line" id="line401"><a name="pos401"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I beg your pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line402"><a name="pos402"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How old was the decision to plant bombs at restaurants and taxi ranks before it was actually executed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line403"><a name="pos403"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Approximately a week or two.</p>
<p class="line" id="line404"><a name="pos404"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> So it is during April of the election?</p>
<p class="line" id="line405"><a name="pos405"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line406"><a name="pos406"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Now at that stage you were in battle mode if I can put it that way?</p>
<p class="line" id="line407"><a name="pos407"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line408"><a name="pos408"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> You had been promoted from secretary general to general in the fighting corps.</p>
<p class="line" id="line409"><a name="pos409"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No, I was not promoted. It was just another term for it. Well in our system or hierarchy it worked that way. Your duties simply shifted from secretary of the AWB to operational and combat general of the AWB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line410"><a name="pos410"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> When were you appointed a general in the AWB then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line411"><a name="pos411"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> November 1992.</p>
<p class="line" id="line412"><a name="pos412"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> And when your functions were changed was that at the same meeting in April about two weeks before the elections?</p>
<p class="line" id="line413"><a name="pos413"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No it could have been at least a week or two before that still.</p>
<p class="line" id="line414"><a name="pos414"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Now the meeting where it was decided to plant bombs, about two weeks before the election, who was the chairperson of that meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line415"><a name="pos415"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well, there wasn't a specific chairperson of such a staff meeting. The chair would be occupied in some instances by Mr Terreblanche or General Ackerman or the person with the greatest length of service.</p>
<p class="line" id="line416"><a name="pos416"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Don't give me "some instances". I am talking about that actual meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line417"><a name="pos417"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I can't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line418"><a name="pos418"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Who was at that actual meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line419"><a name="pos419"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Who was the chairperson?</p>
<p class="line" id="line420"><a name="pos420"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> No, just tell me who was at the meeting? Is that the names you gave us yesterday?</p>
<p class="line" id="line421"><a name="pos421"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Is that the Trimpark meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line422"><a name="pos422"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> The General staff meeting about two weeks before the election at which the General staff decided to plant bombs at taxi ranks, restaurants and other black targets. That meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line423"><a name="pos423"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That was at Fyndoorings, outside Ventersdorp.</p>
<p class="line" id="line424"><a name="pos424"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Am I correct? I have got Kiewiet Roodt, Cruywagen, Eugene Terreblanche, Jaco Oelofse, Dirk Ackerman, his brother Ackerman, the other Terreblanche and yourself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line425"><a name="pos425"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line426"><a name="pos426"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Are those the people who decided to bomb soft targets?</p>
<p class="line" id="line427"><a name="pos427"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line428"><a name="pos428"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Who when you were in the war mode was the commander in chief of the war that you were now going to fight?</p>
<p class="line" id="line429"><a name="pos429"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well every general had his own region in which he was supposed to act.</p>
<p class="line" id="line430"><a name="pos430"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well who was the overall chief commander of the entire war effort?</p>
<p class="line" id="line431"><a name="pos431"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> At the end of the day that would have been Eugene Terreblanche.</p>
<p class="line" id="line432"><a name="pos432"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was he in control?</p>
<p class="line" id="line433"><a name="pos433"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line434"><a name="pos434"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Now you have been asked this morning about why you didn't claim the success of the Johannesburg bomb. You said after the Johannesburg bomb someone said: "Well it looks good," you considered it to be a success and then two things happened that I find surprising. First of all Mr Rundel who is said to be AWB spokesman. Rundel said: "The recent bombings ( I am reading from a report of the 25th of April, Business Day). Rundel said: "Recent bombings could have been carried out by any number of right-wing groups operating outside usual right-wing structures and denied the AWB was involved in any of the incidents." It is not just that you had said nothing. Your structure actually denied that you set the bombs. Now why would that be?</p>
<p class="line" id="line435"><a name="pos435"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I can only tell you that Mr Rundel was not at all and never has been a military official or part of a Wencommando of the AWB. If he had made any statements at that stage that he himself would then expose himself to prosecution.</p>
<p class="line" id="line436"><a name="pos436"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Because he gave the same evidence in mitigation at the criminal proceedings. He said: "that it wasn't upon the instructions of the AWB," or something to that effect. That is not correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line437"><a name="pos437"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I don't know about that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line438"><a name="pos438"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> The other thing that is very surprising to me, forget about public announcements, but all the people who were at the wildsplaas and none of them knew about it, nobody said: "We have had our first success in our war." Nobody told them that it was an AWB bomb. Why would that be?</p>
<p class="line" id="line439"><a name="pos439"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Why didn't anybody know about it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line440"><a name="pos440"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Well, you knew about it and you were there. Couldn't you call a meeting and say: "We have had a - things look good," as you put it. "We have killed 7 innocent people, we have injured 13 innocent people and we have blown up the shops and cars of other innocent people"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line441"><a name="pos441"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No, I didn't communicate the successes which had been achieved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line442"><a name="pos442"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> You see the impression that we got the last time is that by that stage the ordinary members were becoming demoralised. They were happy to go back to their families by then. Wouldn't the proper thing to do would be to announce a successful mission, if that is what you thought it was?</p>
<p class="line" id="line443"><a name="pos443"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No, I think that the morale of everybody at any stage was very high. The fact that members would return to their homes was not because the fact that they had low morale, it was simply to visit their family members or their families. It was not because they had to boost their morale.</p>
<p class="line" id="line444"><a name="pos444"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> But you asking other people to go out and plant bombs, wouldn't you expect the leadership to say: "We have already had a success. You are one of a great team here"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line445"><a name="pos445"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No, I think that at all times by various commanders it was communicated to their subordinates that success had been achieved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line446"><a name="pos446"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> But you didn't do it with your region?</p>
<p class="line" id="line447"><a name="pos447"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well I am speaking about my region.</p>
<p class="line" id="line448"><a name="pos448"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Why didn't you do it in your region if it was an AWB event?</p>
<p class="line" id="line449"><a name="pos449"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That is correct. Perhaps through the commanders it was communicated that certain successes had been achieved but I personally at a certain stage did not call the people together and say: "You have done well."</p>
<p class="line" id="line450"><a name="pos450"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> But you had a meeting there to talk about pipe bombs by which time the Jo'burg bomb had already gone off, not so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line451"><a name="pos451"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line452"><a name="pos452"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> You didn't have to call a meeting. You just had to say: "This is an AWB bomb. We have done it, we are going to do some more."</p>
<p class="line" id="line453"><a name="pos453"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Where was this meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line454"><a name="pos454"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Wildsplaas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line455"><a name="pos455"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No, I didn't address any public gathering.</p>
<p class="line" id="line456"><a name="pos456"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> The question is not that. The question is that everybody was busy with the execution of their duties as you had determined it and others in terms of their own discretion and they would implement the plans and achieve success. They would know about the Germiston, Randfontein, Jo'burg and other bombs but you don't tell anybody: "Look at how successful we are." Why not? Just answer me regarding that. Why didn't you announce your successes?</p>
<p class="line" id="line457"><a name="pos457"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well I simply didn't do it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line458"><a name="pos458"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> You asked de Wet to make his vehicle with the towbar available. He receives his orders from Myburg and Barnard, he goes out, they carry out their orders, a terrible bomb, he returns and he is on the same terrain where you are -you don't even thank him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line459"><a name="pos459"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes I would have done that but I wouldn't have called everybody together.</p>
<p class="line" id="line460"><a name="pos460"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But that wasn't the question. The question was why you didn't inform your people. You said you would have done it but the question is did you do it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line461"><a name="pos461"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I did tell certain people such as among others Mr de Wet that it had been successful. But what I mean is that I didn't call everybody together and announce to them: "Well, well done."</p>
<p class="line" id="line462"><a name="pos462"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Well why not because that is Mr Bracher's question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line463"><a name="pos463"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That simply wasn't my style of operation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line464"><a name="pos464"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> The next question is this;  ...(indistinct) step is not taken to announce it publicly and to claim responsibility that it is part of your strategy to get a Volkstaat, why then do you proceed with the Germiston bomb when the plan is simply not being put into operation by Mr Terreblanche?</p>
<p class="line" id="line465"><a name="pos465"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> It was not my duty at that stage to make such a statement.</p>
<p class="line" id="line466"><a name="pos466"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> But couldn't you get into the car as you seem to have done on a few occasions and gone to head-office and say: "What has gone wrong with our plan? We have killed 7 people and nobody has claimed responsibility." Why do you bomb more innocent people when the plan is not working?</p>
<p class="line" id="line467"><a name="pos467"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That was the instructions from the Generals in staff that we must continue. At that stage I believed that they will still do it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line468"><a name="pos468"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Then I think you did not understand the question. The question was why didn't you accept responsibility?</p>
<p class="line" id="line469"><a name="pos469"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> They were supposed to accept responsibility.</p>
<p class="line" id="line470"><a name="pos470"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why didn't you do it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line471"><a name="pos471"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> It was not my duty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line472"><a name="pos472"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was it discussed at the Generals in staff who must take responsibility?</p>
<p class="line" id="line473"><a name="pos473"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes. The AWB had to take responsibility but as I testified earlier on at that stage they had to know that there would be problems later on. There would be arrests and so on. At least a possibility of it. It seemed to me that they decided to take another direction.</p>
<p class="line" id="line474"><a name="pos474"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> In this whole operation did you at least or you had at least three generals visiting you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line475"><a name="pos475"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line476"><a name="pos476"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you not discuss this with them and tell them or say to them: "When will the AWB make this announcement? This is part of a plan. How else must the government know why this bomb was detonated?"</p>
<p class="line" id="line477"><a name="pos477"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> We did discuss this at one stage. Somebody will have to make a press release. That was during the visit of the three generals at the game farm. They would have discussed this with Mr Terreblanche and other commanders. I did not receive any feedback from them again concerning this. They did not pertinently tell me who will do this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line478"><a name="pos478"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Let me ask another question. The purpose of the whole operation was to prevent people from voting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line479"><a name="pos479"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line480"><a name="pos480"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How would the ordinary person on grassroots level know this? That they must get away from the voting polls.</p>
<p class="line" id="line481"><a name="pos481"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Through the media.</p>
<p class="line" id="line482"><a name="pos482"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is that true? Why weren't the people then told? This is fair play, give them a warning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line483"><a name="pos483"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Those bombings had to serve as a warning for the rest of the country.</p>
<p class="line" id="line484"><a name="pos484"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How must they know then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line485"><a name="pos485"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Through the media. Everybody knew it was the right-wing who did it. Or we assumed that everybody knew that it was the right-wing who planted this bomb.</p>
<p class="line" id="line486"><a name="pos486"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The first thing that was written about the bombs and the right-wing the AWB denied it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line487"><a name="pos487"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I understand now that it was Mr Rundel who denied this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line488"><a name="pos488"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Where was Mr Terreblanche when this meeting was held at Fyndoorings where they talked about the bombs? Mr Eugene Terreblanche, where was he?</p>
<p class="line" id="line489"><a name="pos489"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> He was also there at Fyndoorings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line490"><a name="pos490"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> You did not mention his name on the question on who was there. If I can remember it correctly. I may make a mistake. You said now for the first time that he was there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line491"><a name="pos491"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> But he was not part of the Generals of staff, he was not a general.</p>
<p class="line" id="line492"><a name="pos492"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Did he not attend this meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line493"><a name="pos493"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, he did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line494"><a name="pos494"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> But at this stage when you decided or you said I am confused, you said that you could not remember who took the chair but you said that Mr Terreblanche as leader sometimes would take the chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line495"><a name="pos495"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> In some circumstances yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line496"><a name="pos496"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Can you remember if he was present when the decision was made concerning the bombs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line497"><a name="pos497"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> He was always present if a decision had to be made concerning the bombs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line498"><a name="pos498"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Could you therefore say that he was present when the bombings were discussed at Fyndoorings and he knew about it, he was well informed about this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line499"><a name="pos499"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line500"><a name="pos500"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Another thing that confuses me while we are there. This Generals in staff they came from all over the country. Is this impression right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line501"><a name="pos501"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, that is.</p>
<p class="line" id="line502"><a name="pos502"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> So where did General Roodt come from?</p>
<p class="line" id="line503"><a name="pos503"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Roodt was from the Free State.</p>
<p class="line" id="line504"><a name="pos504"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Cruywagen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line505"><a name="pos505"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Eastern Transvaal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line506"><a name="pos506"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> And Prinsloo?</p>
<p class="line" id="line507"><a name="pos507"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That is myself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line508"><a name="pos508"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> I am sorry. Oelofse?</p>
<p class="line" id="line509"><a name="pos509"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Witwatersrand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line510"><a name="pos510"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Dirk Ackerman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line511"><a name="pos511"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> He was from the Free State.</p>
<p class="line" id="line512"><a name="pos512"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> And the other Ackerman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line513"><a name="pos513"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Also from the Free State.</p>
<p class="line" id="line514"><a name="pos514"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> And Terreblanche, Andries Terreblanche?</p>
<p class="line" id="line515"><a name="pos515"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> He was from the Western Transvaal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line516"><a name="pos516"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> How often did you come together?</p>
<p class="line" id="line517"><a name="pos517"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Sometimes once a week but on a regular basis.</p>
<p class="line" id="line518"><a name="pos518"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> And at that stage when you sent a message that you communication lines were down and the Generals in staff must come and see you, where were all these generals? Were they in Ventersdorp? Because only 4 came to see you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line519"><a name="pos519"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, at that stage - I was not in Ventersdorp myself when I met the people.</p>
<p class="line" id="line520"><a name="pos520"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> But you sent the message. Where did you think they were?</p>
<p class="line" id="line521"><a name="pos521"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> The map that was compiled of Western Transvaal or of this area that would be announced, every general received an area on this map that he had to protect.</p>
<p class="line" id="line522"><a name="pos522"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> In the Western Transvaal?</p>
<p class="line" id="line523"><a name="pos523"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes. So all these people were gathered together in the Western Transvaal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line524"><a name="pos524"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> So at that stage no incidents occurred then in the Free State, Natal and the other areas?</p>
<p class="line" id="line525"><a name="pos525"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, they did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line526"><a name="pos526"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Under whose command did this happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line527"><a name="pos527"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> It was under the commander who fell under the general.</p>
<p class="line" id="line528"><a name="pos528"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> But who did the coordination then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line529"><a name="pos529"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> It was through communication.</p>
<p class="line" id="line530"><a name="pos530"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Certainly there had to or General Ackerman was the Free State's general, he certainly commanded what was going on there or was in charge of what was going on there but now he is in the Western Transvaal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line531"><a name="pos531"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, that is correct but his commandos would serve there and then there were also members under his command from the Free State who for example Welkom who would serve here in the Western Transvaal.</p>
<p class="line" id="line532"><a name="pos532"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> According to you in expectation all the generals were in the Western Transvaal when you asked them to come and see you. What exactly did you want to discuss with them, because you now received your instructions and your discretion in to work out the finer details yourself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line533"><a name="pos533"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Amongst others the communication. They had to provide me with a system in which I could communicate.</p>
<p class="line" id="line534"><a name="pos534"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> So you didn't want to discuss the matter of the bombs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line535"><a name="pos535"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, amongst others I would definitely have discussed it with them. But I just notified Ventersdorp that I wanted to see them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line536"><a name="pos536"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> What was your primary problem? The communication?</p>
<p class="line" id="line537"><a name="pos537"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, the communication was my primary problem.</p>
<p class="line" id="line538"><a name="pos538"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Did you at that stage identify any specific problems concerning the bombs that you wanted to discuss with them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line539"><a name="pos539"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line540"><a name="pos540"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> So the bombs was an extra matter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line541"><a name="pos541"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No I did not have any problems with them. I did not think that there would be any problems in sending out the bombs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line542"><a name="pos542"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> But no, my question is that when you told the generals that they must come and see you, your primary purpose was to discuss the communication problems with them. You were actually there to discuss the bomb planting with your men. Was this a problem that you wanted to discuss with them or would you just discuss the communication and then the bombs?</p>
<p class="line" id="line543"><a name="pos543"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> We would have discussed it, yes. It is logically.</p>
<p class="line" id="line544"><a name="pos544"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Was this on the agenda? You wanted to talk to them about the communication and the bombing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line545"><a name="pos545"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well everything that I would convey to them if I had a radio system concerning the logistics and the workings of the camp. Everything I would have communicated for them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line546"><a name="pos546"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Thank you</p>
<p class="line" id="line547"><a name="pos547"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Yes now I am interested in that. That communication, you know you use the word communication. You didn't want to talk to them about a radio that wouldn't work. That is not why you wanted to talk to them. You would deal with your technician on that aspect. You wanted to talk to them about the substance of what you were doing there. That is what you wanted to communicate with them over the radio. So they came across physically so that you could communicate whatever that was to them and get their feedback. You had a long meeting. What is it that you were communicating to them? What were those discussions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line548"><a name="pos548"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> It was about everything that happened in the camp. The actions that were executed at that stage. It was about communication and various other aspects, logistics.</p>
<p class="line" id="line549"><a name="pos549"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Mr Prinsloo in this hearing we are talking about 4 bombs, the Johannesburg bomb, the Germiston bomb, the Jan Smuts bomb and I want to group them together - the pipe bombs.  Now in order to decided to those bombings how many General staff decisions and meetings were held?</p>
<p class="line" id="line550"><a name="pos550"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well I cannot remember. There were various meetings.</p>
<p class="line" id="line551"><a name="pos551"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Did you have a special meeting at which it was decided you now want an international incident and you must bomb Jan Smuts airport?</p>
<p class="line" id="line552"><a name="pos552"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No, there was not a specific meeting for that. It was conveyed to us that we had to make international news.</p>
<p class="line" id="line553"><a name="pos553"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> How was that decision taken by the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line554"><a name="pos554"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> It had the approval of the Generals in staff because they visited me and during their visit I conveyed this to them and we discussed this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line555"><a name="pos555"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Now that is the point I am getting to. We have now got two meetings. One two weeks before and one with that visit. Now who was on that visit? Just give me the names of the people who came on that visit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line556"><a name="pos556"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> The people who came to visit me at the game farm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line557"><a name="pos557"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line558"><a name="pos558"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> It was General Roodt, Cruywagen, General Ackerman, Dirk Ackerman. Under correction now General Ackerman. There were at least three members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line559"><a name="pos559"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> You said to us now that when decisions are taken Mr Eugene Terreblanche was always present. Was he there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line560"><a name="pos560"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> At the game farm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line561"><a name="pos561"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line562"><a name="pos562"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line563"><a name="pos563"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Were they conveying to you a decision taken by the General staff or did you have a meeting there which decided you wanted an international incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line564"><a name="pos564"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well I accepted that it was generally discussed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line565"><a name="pos565"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> If it was discussed in general would you have been part of that meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line566"><a name="pos566"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No, they wouldn't have called me in.</p>
<p class="line" id="line567"><a name="pos567"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you not part of the Generals in staff?</p>
<p class="line" id="line568"><a name="pos568"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes I was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line569"><a name="pos569"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So in other words where would this have been discussed then before it came to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line570"><a name="pos570"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> In Ventersdorp at a certain stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line571"><a name="pos571"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But who would have attended this meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line572"><a name="pos572"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Mr Chairperson it would have been members who was in Ventersdorp who was close to Ventersdorp. It could have been at a member or two or three did not attend this meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line573"><a name="pos573"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you not make those decisions there at that stage, the 4 of you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line574"><a name="pos574"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, at the game farm but with approval.</p>
<p class="line" id="line575"><a name="pos575"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Whose approval?</p>
<p class="line" id="line576"><a name="pos576"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> It would have received approval of the whole Generals in staff and Terreblanche.</p>
<p class="line" id="line577"><a name="pos577"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You said that you thought, you are not sure?</p>
<p class="line" id="line578"><a name="pos578"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well I can with certainty say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line579"><a name="pos579"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now you as a member of the Generals in staff, were you present at a meeting where it was decided that it is necessary that an international incident must take place at possibly the airport?</p>
<p class="line" id="line580"><a name="pos580"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I was at such a meeting, yes at the game farm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line581"><a name="pos581"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And who was present there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line582"><a name="pos582"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> The generals that came to visit me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line583"><a name="pos583"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you do not know if there was another meeting where that decision was made?</p>
<p class="line" id="line584"><a name="pos584"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> We would never have come up with a proposal if it did not carry the approval of the rest of the Generals in staff.</p>
<p class="line" id="line585"><a name="pos585"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But if it was discussed before and you had to be at that meeting or at least being invited to that meeting because you are a member of the Generals in staff.</p>
<p class="line" id="line586"><a name="pos586"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> They would have notified me, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line587"><a name="pos587"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So, they did not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line588"><a name="pos588"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well these people did come and give me a message, answers</p>
<p class="line" id="line589"><a name="pos589"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You accepted it was a message. You did not know it was a message.</p>
<p class="line" id="line590"><a name="pos590"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I cannot with certainty say, no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line591"><a name="pos591"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> The visit that you are referring to am I right when I say that you said it was a Generals in staff meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line592"><a name="pos592"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> You can call it that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line593"><a name="pos593"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> No, that is what you said. Were you present at such a meeting where the question regarding the international incident was discussed? You answered - it is not me who said it, you answered: "Yes I was at such a meeting during that visit they again asked who was present. You said Roodt, Cruywagen and under correction you think Ackerman and yourself.</p>
<p class="line" id="line594"><a name="pos594"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line595"><a name="pos595"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> That is your definition of a Generals in staff meeting.</p>
<p class="line" id="line596"><a name="pos596"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line597"><a name="pos597"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> So the Generals in staff did not have a quorum - not at that stage, at any stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line598"><a name="pos598"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> At previous meetings there was or there had to be a quorum but at that stage we were in a process of warfare and we just saw that it was not necessary to have a quorum.</p>
<p class="line" id="line599"><a name="pos599"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can you say that the leader of the AWB was aware of that decision when it was taken?</p>
<p class="line" id="line600"><a name="pos600"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> It would definitely be conveyed to him after the decision was made but I cannot say that at that specific moment knew about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line601"><a name="pos601"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> How can you say that it definitely be conveyed to him? Were you not even then or didn't you even convey information to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line602"><a name="pos602"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> What didn't I convey to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line603"><a name="pos603"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> The pipe bombs, the Johannesburg bomb you did not report back to him. Why do you expect others to do it then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line604"><a name="pos604"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> When did I not report back?</p>
<p class="line" id="line605"><a name="pos605"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did you go and tell the leader that: "We implemented the Johannesburg bomb"?</p>
<p class="line" id="line606"><a name="pos606"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> At various opportunities I drove through and I reported back to the Generals in staff and Eugene Terreblanche.</p>
<p class="line" id="line607"><a name="pos607"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And did you do this between the Sunday and the Wednesday?</p>
<p class="line" id="line608"><a name="pos608"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes at various opportunities. That is why I needed these people to rectify my communication because General Cruywagen was in charge or put in charge by the Generals in staff.</p>
<p class="line" id="line609"><a name="pos609"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When was the first time that you went through to Mr Terreblanche and spoke to him after the Bree Street bomb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line610"><a name="pos610"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> It was the Sunday and then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line611"><a name="pos611"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was the first time the Sunday after the Bree Street bomb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line612"><a name="pos612"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> The Sunday was the 24th it had to be after the Bree Street bombs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line613"><a name="pos613"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Now I am asking when was the first time after the Bree Street bomb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line614"><a name="pos614"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That was the Sunday when I went through.</p>
<p class="line" id="line615"><a name="pos615"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And what time did that bomb go off?</p>
<p class="line" id="line616"><a name="pos616"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> It was early the morning.</p>
<p class="line" id="line617"><a name="pos617"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So on that day you went back to Terreblanche?</p>
<p class="line" id="line618"><a name="pos618"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line619"><a name="pos619"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line620"><a name="pos620"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Under correction, it was not too late.</p>
<p class="line" id="line621"><a name="pos621"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And what did you say to him or why did you go to him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line622"><a name="pos622"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I especially went to Ventersdorp because I wanted the people on the farm to work out my communication system and General Cruywagen was in charge or placed in charge of amongst others the communication network throughout the whole area as well as the other areas.</p>
<p class="line" id="line623"><a name="pos623"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you see Terreblanche on that day?</p>
<p class="line" id="line624"><a name="pos624"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line625"><a name="pos625"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And what did you discuss with him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line626"><a name="pos626"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I discussed the bomb.</p>
<p class="line" id="line627"><a name="pos627"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The Bree Street bomb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line628"><a name="pos628"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line629"><a name="pos629"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> What did you tell him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line630"><a name="pos630"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I just said or I asked him did he know what happened or what time it happened. At that stage I did not specifically know when it happened. I did not have the details.</p>
<p class="line" id="line631"><a name="pos631"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So you went to Mr Terreblanche to get information?</p>
<p class="line" id="line632"><a name="pos632"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That is what was on the television.</p>
<p class="line" id="line633"><a name="pos633"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Not to report back to him but to get information from him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line634"><a name="pos634"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Also to get information and to report back.</p>
<p class="line" id="line635"><a name="pos635"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> About what did you want to report back?</p>
<p class="line" id="line636"><a name="pos636"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That the bomb was sent out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line637"><a name="pos637"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But if you go and ask Terreblanche when did this go off then what could you have told him then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line638"><a name="pos638"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes but there were specific times and groups. I did not see Mr Barnard them during the rest of that day.</p>
<p class="line" id="line639"><a name="pos639"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Prinsloo we have to accept that if you went to go and ask Terreblanche what time the bomb went off how could you then assume that he did not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line640"><a name="pos640"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> He definitely knew about it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line641"><a name="pos641"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Then why did you then go through to Ventersdorp to go and tell him that there was a bomb attack and that we did it in Bree Street if he knew about it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line642"><a name="pos642"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line643"><a name="pos643"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you realised that he knew about it you were going to ask him when the bomb went off.</p>
<p class="line" id="line644"><a name="pos644"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, that is correct. We would have discussed this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line645"><a name="pos645"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And you said that you saw General Cruywagen there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line646"><a name="pos646"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line647"><a name="pos647"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Why did Cruywagen and Roodt go back to the game farm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line648"><a name="pos648"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I did not see them in Ventersdorp.</p>
<p class="line" id="line649"><a name="pos649"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> No you were asked if I heard you correctly but I will look at my notes but if I heard you correctly you said the Sunday that you went in to Ventersdorp you amongst others saw General Cruywagen and then it was also asked did you see Mr Terreblanche and you said - I would just like you to remind me but I would just like to construct what I have got in mind and what I heard you say. You said amongst others on the Sunday you wanted to go and speak with Cruywagen because he was in charge of communication for the area as well as a larger area and you had a problem and you went to go and discuss this with him and then you were asked if you saw the leader and then you said yes. Did you see him or did you not see him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line650"><a name="pos650"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No, I didn't see him. They came to visit me on the game farm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line651"><a name="pos651"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Who else did you see there? The leader and?</p>
<p class="line" id="line652"><a name="pos652"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> There were various other leaders or members in Ventersdorp.</p>
<p class="line" id="line653"><a name="pos653"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Was this of the Generals in staff?</p>
<p class="line" id="line654"><a name="pos654"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No I cannot remember if I saw any one of the Generals in staff.</p>
<p class="line" id="line655"><a name="pos655"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Then why did you go there then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line656"><a name="pos656"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> To get the people who could establish a communication system for me so in order for us to communicate with the other areas. I am sorry?</p>
<p class="line" id="line657"><a name="pos657"></a>PROBLEMS WITH MICROPHONES</p>
<p class="line" id="line658"><a name="pos658"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> With the people who would come to visit me on the farm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line659"><a name="pos659"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So did you discuss it with them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line660"><a name="pos660"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> With the people who came to visit me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line661"><a name="pos661"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No that morning when you went to Ventersdorp.</p>
<p class="line" id="line662"><a name="pos662"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well that was in the afternoon.</p>
<p class="line" id="line663"><a name="pos663"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well then the afternoon in Ventersdorp.</p>
<p class="line" id="line664"><a name="pos664"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I did convey the message to the people in Ventersdorp. To specifically send a communication person to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line665"><a name="pos665"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you also tell this to the leader?</p>
<p class="line" id="line666"><a name="pos666"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I could have mentioned it to him, I am not sure that I did. It is possible that I could have done it. I cannot specifically say I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line667"><a name="pos667"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> The evidence of the previous witness and I think your evidence is that over those few days when the bombings were taking place you drove backwards and forwards to and from Ventersdorp and you said just now that was two or three occasions. Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line668"><a name="pos668"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes it could be so, two or three times. I cannot specifically remember how many times.</p>
<p class="line" id="line669"><a name="pos669"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Well a few occasions. It was two or three a fair guess?</p>
<p class="line" id="line670"><a name="pos670"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, I would say approximately.</p>
<p class="line" id="line671"><a name="pos671"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> When you went back to head-office who did you phone there on those occasions? Who was in charge of the head-office?</p>
<p class="line" id="line672"><a name="pos672"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Sometimes it would be Generals in staff, members of the Generals in staff. Terreblanche was always present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line673"><a name="pos673"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Mr Eugene Terreblanche was always present?</p>
<p class="line" id="line674"><a name="pos674"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line675"><a name="pos675"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Can you remember who else was present when you went back?</p>
<p class="line" id="line676"><a name="pos676"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> A person or if someone or if Mr Terreblanche was not in his office I would find him on his farm or somewhere in town. Ventersdorp is not a big place and at that stage there were hundreds of members in Ventersdorp.</p>
<p class="line" id="line677"><a name="pos677"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Now we are not talking about members. I am talking about leadership.</p>
<p class="line" id="line678"><a name="pos678"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> There were various commanders there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line679"><a name="pos679"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Except to go back to sort out your communication problems what else did you go back to do at head-office?</p>
<p class="line" id="line680"><a name="pos680"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well I went to go and visit my farm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line681"><a name="pos681"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> No, no, no at head-office. You see you were the go-between between Wildsplaas and head-office conveying orders backwards and forwards.</p>
<p class="line" id="line682"><a name="pos682"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line683"><a name="pos683"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> What were those orders.</p>
<p class="line" id="line684"><a name="pos684"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> My orders? I went to go and report back at Ventersdorp and at one opportunity I went to go and try and find a person who would be responsible for communication between the game farm and the other areas in the district.</p>
<p class="line" id="line685"><a name="pos685"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Did you go back to head-office to report about the Germiston bomb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line686"><a name="pos686"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Amongst others yes because at that stage there were various bombs that went off at different places as well as people who were arrested with explosives.</p>
<p class="line" id="line687"><a name="pos687"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Did you go and report those events to head-office?</p>
<p class="line" id="line688"><a name="pos688"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well I had to do it at some stage. The times and dates I cannot specifically say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line689"><a name="pos689"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who did you report to?</p>
<p class="line" id="line690"><a name="pos690"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I did to co-members of the Generals in staff.</p>
<p class="line" id="line691"><a name="pos691"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Do you remember who those were though, which members of the General staff?</p>
<p class="line" id="line692"><a name="pos692"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well at one stage or at stages it could have been General Oelofse, General Ackerman, General Terreblanche.</p>
<p class="line" id="line693"><a name="pos693"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Eugene Terreblanche?</p>
<p class="line" id="line694"><a name="pos694"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No, General Terreblanche.</p>
<p class="line" id="line695"><a name="pos695"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> What is his first name?</p>
<p class="line" id="line696"><a name="pos696"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Andries.</p>
<p class="line" id="line697"><a name="pos697"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Ackerman, is that Dirk Ackerman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line698"><a name="pos698"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That is correct they are also two brothers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line699"><a name="pos699"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> What is the brother's name.</p>
<p class="line" id="line700"><a name="pos700"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well I cannot remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line701"><a name="pos701"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> You don't remember who you reported about the bombings then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line702"><a name="pos702"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well it was a members of the Generals in staff but I cannot specifically say that Pretoria was reported back to 4 of these members or 5 of these Generals in staff. I cannot remember their names or cannot say.</p>
<p class="line" id="line703"><a name="pos703"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why did you not report back to the leader because he is at head of the war?</p>
<p class="line" id="line704"><a name="pos704"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> We always reported back to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line705"><a name="pos705"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> By you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line706"><a name="pos706"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes and by Brigadier Leon van der Merwe.</p>
<p class="line" id="line707"><a name="pos707"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No I am not talking about other people. I am talking about you. Every time that you went to Ventersdorp and you reported back did you report back to the leader? Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line708"><a name="pos708"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes that is correct. At one stage during that visit to Ventersdorp I would see him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line709"><a name="pos709"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well you certainly with the Germiston bomb and the pipe bombs reported back to the leader and that is after the meeting with the three other generals or it had to be after the meeting with the other generals?</p>
<p class="line" id="line710"><a name="pos710"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line711"><a name="pos711"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you never discuss with the leader when you reported back about Germiston that you understand that there also must be an international incident?</p>
<p class="line" id="line712"><a name="pos712"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I cannot remember that, no -if he mentioned it to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line713"><a name="pos713"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why didn't you discuss this with him because you were not present at a meeting where it according to you had to be discussed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line714"><a name="pos714"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That afternoon after the people left to the shooting range I left the shooting range and went back to Ventersdorp. If I mentioned it there to him I do not know. I definitely saw him and members of the Generals in staff. There was members of the Generals in staff who visited the shooting range when I left. I cannot remember who it was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line715"><a name="pos715"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Prinsloo let us keep to the international incident. You were now informed, according to your evidence, that you must execute or begin an international incident. You receive an opportunity after you were informed about this to go and talk to the leader. An international incident during the elections in South Africa at that stage would have been a big thing. Is that not true?</p>
<p class="line" id="line716"><a name="pos716"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, that is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line717"><a name="pos717"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And part of the planning was that the leader would then announce who would be responsible for it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line718"><a name="pos718"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line719"><a name="pos719"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> How can you not remember if you discussed this with him or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line720"><a name="pos720"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well I would have had to have discussed it with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line721"><a name="pos721"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Can you remember or not? It is an exception. It is important. It is not something out of the ordinary.</p>
<p class="line" id="line722"><a name="pos722"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well at that stage all explosions were important to us. I can't remember that I would specifically only have mentioned that to him. It is logical that I would have mentioned it to him but I can't say with certainty whether or not I did so at that stage.</p>
<p class="line" id="line723"><a name="pos723"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Mr Prinsloo there is another mystery that I want you to clear up. You told us that the Bree Street, Johannesburg bomb was a sneller, it was one of the important bombs in the whole campaign, it was the start of everything. You also told us that you had set up all your structures and your supply lines. Why did you not supply to Koesterfontein from the AWB the things that they needed to make the bomb? We have heard that they had to scratch around in the grass the get an old grass roller and bits of metal and this and that, borrow a trailer without telling the owner in advance they were borrowing it. That doesn't show any kind of organisation at all. Now why is that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line724"><a name="pos724"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well I can assure you that everything was very well organised and planned within the organisation. The fact that they scratched around looking for explosives [intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line725"><a name="pos725"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Bits of metal to put on top of it to make it worse.</p>
<p class="line" id="line726"><a name="pos726"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Could I just intervene at this point. I don't wish to make an objection. I know that during other amnesty applications this sort of thing was never allowed. I don't wish to object but the idea which is being created here by Mr Bracher is that there was an unorganised manufacturing of bombs taking place and that in essence people scratched around for the parts for bombs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line727"><a name="pos727"></a>	With all respect it was a bomb that was being manufactured. They were looking for scraps of metal in order to have shrapnel. They had the equipment. We heard evidence from Mr Venter who went to fetch the explosives in Welkom and it was a very powerful bomb that went off as a result of the shrapnel. It is not that it was an unorganised scratching around on the farm. It was just that they went to go and look for the metal to put onto the bomb. It is such an unnecessary patronage of this person's evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line728"><a name="pos728"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Mr Prinsloo what did you supply for the bomb? You told us at the beginning of your evidence in chief that you were in charge of supplies I think.</p>
<p class="line" id="line729"><a name="pos729"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I beg your pardon? I was in command of supplies?</p>
<p class="line" id="line730"><a name="pos730"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Supplies.</p>
<p class="line" id="line731"><a name="pos731"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well that is the logistics. Supplies don't have anything to do with the explosives.</p>
<p class="line" id="line732"><a name="pos732"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Who organised that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line733"><a name="pos733"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That would have been the various commanders or the special officers who were involved with that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line734"><a name="pos734"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Who would be the person supplying equipment or explosives for that bomb to Koesterfontein?</p>
<p class="line" id="line735"><a name="pos735"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Which bomb would that be?</p>
<p class="line" id="line736"><a name="pos736"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Any one of the Koesterfontein bombs.</p>
<p class="line" id="line737"><a name="pos737"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> From all over as I understood it explosives were collected. Who specifically did this is unknown to me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line738"><a name="pos738"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Was none of this organised from headquarters?</p>
<p class="line" id="line739"><a name="pos739"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well there were explosives which were stored in head-office. Whether that specific store of explosives were used in Koesterfontein or on the game farm is not possible for me to say with certainty. It is possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line740"><a name="pos740"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Can I put it differently. Is the short answer that you simply don't know who supplied anything to Koesterfontein? You personally don't know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line741"><a name="pos741"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Personally I don't know but what I can tell you is that I know that explosives were taken from head-office as well as parachutes and these were transported to Koesterfontein, explosives. However, whether it was that specific charge of explosives from head-office is unknown to me. I don't know if it was that explosives which was used in the Pretoria bomb or the Germiston bomb or the Bree Street bomb.</p>
<p class="line" id="line742"><a name="pos742"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> The other mystery is this. You are the General staff commander of that area in which the bombs are being made, why did you never go to Koesterfontein?</p>
<p class="line" id="line743"><a name="pos743"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Because I did not regard that as my duty.</p>
<p class="line" id="line744"><a name="pos744"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> But it was your duty. You were the commander of that region where the great sneller of your whole campaign was going to begin.</p>
<p class="line" id="line745"><a name="pos745"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes there were other members under my command who were in charge of such tasks.</p>
<p class="line" id="line746"><a name="pos746"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Who were they?</p>
<p class="line" id="line747"><a name="pos747"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> There were various persons; Mr Johan Smit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line748"><a name="pos748"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> I am talking about General staff members.</p>
<p class="line" id="line749"><a name="pos749"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No, Generals in staff wouldn't have reached that. Except for Leon van der Merwe who was also a member of Generals in staff. He might have been there. But I never specifically inspected Koesterfontein the farm.</p>
<p class="line" id="line750"><a name="pos750"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Why do you say it isn't your duty? Why do you say that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line751"><a name="pos751"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Because I delegated some of my tasks and duties to members under my command.</p>
<p class="line" id="line752"><a name="pos752"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Okay now who did you delegate that function to, to go and check up on the happenings in Koesterfontein?</p>
<p class="line" id="line753"><a name="pos753"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well I can't remember that I delegated that task to anyone specific but Mr Cliff Barnard at a certain point reported to me. I think it was approximately two or three occasions. He reported to me regarding what they were busy with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line754"><a name="pos754"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was it not your task to go and inspect what was going on there? Is that how you saw it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line755"><a name="pos755"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well I believe if there had been time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line756"><a name="pos756"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, this is the big bomb. This is the beginning of the great war. It was manufactured in your jurisdiction and you say that it wasn't your duty because it wouldn't have been your duty because you would have delegated it to someone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line757"><a name="pos757"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line758"><a name="pos758"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was it your duty before you delegated it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line759"><a name="pos759"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well I should be believe that it was my duty and the fact that Mr Barnard was entrusted with that order was enough reason for me to believe that he was the right person for the job. Specifically with regard to the Johannesburg bomb then.</p>
<p class="line" id="line760"><a name="pos760"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> What was Mr Barnard's rank?</p>
<p class="line" id="line761"><a name="pos761"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> He was a captain in the Ystergarde but he was also a specialist in his own field. He didn't wear a uniform in order to make it more specific. He didn't serve in any specific group or group of members of the Ystergarde or the Wencommando. He was the confidante of Mr Terreblanche. He was a specialist in his field and he was a very well highly trained person.</p>
<p class="line" id="line762"><a name="pos762"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> After the Johannesburg, Bree Street bomb who reported back to you about the events?</p>
<p class="line" id="line763"><a name="pos763"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Mr Barnard and Myburg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line764"><a name="pos764"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Did they come to you on the game farm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line765"><a name="pos765"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes I must have seen them there at a certain point but I can't remember exactly what time. It must have been on the Sunday.</p>
<p class="line" id="line766"><a name="pos766"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> It must have been after the bomb and before you went to head-office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line767"><a name="pos767"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line768"><a name="pos768"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> What is your evidence about whether the radio on the farm was working or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line769"><a name="pos769"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> On the game farm? Whether or not I had a radio?</p>
<p class="line" id="line770"><a name="pos770"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Some witnesses have said there was a radio masted up and there was a radio communication with the outside world.</p>
<p class="line" id="line771"><a name="pos771"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line772"><a name="pos772"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Mr Smit said yesterday the radio wasn't working.</p>
<p class="line" id="line773"><a name="pos773"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line774"><a name="pos774"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Which is correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line775"><a name="pos775"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> There was communication between the mast and vehicles who were moving around in the area, in the immediate area. There was also communication between the sleeping quarters or the barracks and the main entrance and then there was also communication between the mast, the ops and patrolling guards in the area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line776"><a name="pos776"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> And between the mast and head-office?</p>
<p class="line" id="line777"><a name="pos777"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> There was no communication. Well at least when I requested communication we had no communication. It could be that at a certain point we had communication at an earlier stage but I myself didn't have any communication.</p>
<p class="line" id="line778"><a name="pos778"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Now when the bombers were sent out to go and bomb targets it seemed to me that the decision where to place those bombs was entirely left to the prejudices of the individual bomber. That there was no order from above as to where to place a bomb.</p>
<p class="line" id="line779"><a name="pos779"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Do you mean specifically in which street or in which premises if that is what you are trying to determine? Because there was no such order.</p>
<p class="line" id="line780"><a name="pos780"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> What was the order for the Johannesburg bomb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line781"><a name="pos781"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Bracher I am sure you are referring to above in a political sense, not in the accurate sense.</p>
<p class="line" id="line782"><a name="pos782"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Yes. What was the order for the Johannesburg bomb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line783"><a name="pos783"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> With regard to what? Which premises it should be?</p>
<p class="line" id="line784"><a name="pos784"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Where did they have to plant that bomb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line785"><a name="pos785"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> There was no specific premises or name of premises, street address.</p>
<p class="line" id="line786"><a name="pos786"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Which bomb are you talking about?</p>
<p class="line" id="line787"><a name="pos787"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> The Johannesburg, Bree Street bomb.</p>
<p class="line" id="line788"><a name="pos788"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The general thing was that it was supposed to be in an area where the most victims would be black. Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line789"><a name="pos789"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line790"><a name="pos790"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Was the order to go to Johannesburg or go to the CBD in Johannesburg or to go to a main street in Johannesburg or what was the order from the General staff?</p>
<p class="line" id="line791"><a name="pos791"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> The city centre of Johannesburg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line792"><a name="pos792"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Did you give that order?</p>
<p class="line" id="line793"><a name="pos793"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, I gave that order.</p>
<p class="line" id="line794"><a name="pos794"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Was that an order that came from a decision of the General staff meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line795"><a name="pos795"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line796"><a name="pos796"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> And the Germiston bomb.</p>
<p class="line" id="line797"><a name="pos797"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> What about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line798"><a name="pos798"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Was the order to bomb the central area of Germiston?</p>
<p class="line" id="line799"><a name="pos799"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well that would have been the logical place to do it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line800"><a name="pos800"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Pardon?</p>
<p class="line" id="line801"><a name="pos801"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line802"><a name="pos802"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> And would that have come from the General staff decision?</p>
<p class="line" id="line803"><a name="pos803"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Naturally that is correct because as I have testified earlier an area was assigned to me which incorporated different towns and everybody in Staff knew Germiston, Boksburg, Springs, Benoni.</p>
<p class="line" id="line804"><a name="pos804"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Let's go back to the Johannesburg, Bree Street bomb. Is it correct then that the General staff didn't care where the individual bomber placed that bomb as long as it was somewhere in the CBD?</p>
<p class="line" id="line805"><a name="pos805"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Johannesburg specifically had to be somewhere in the inner city. That was the discretion of the person who would be driving the vehicle.</p>
<p class="line" id="line806"><a name="pos806"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> And if he put that bomb outside an Inkatha hostel that was just too bad. Were there no ANC people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line807"><a name="pos807"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No these people knew what they were doing. They did their homework.</p>
<p class="line" id="line808"><a name="pos808"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Well you see it was a very funny thing. They didn't do any homework. They found one man that knew Johannesburg and it seems all he knew was where the massage parlours were.</p>
<p class="line" id="line809"><a name="pos809"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line810"><a name="pos810"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> That is not fair. It wasn't the only thing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line811"><a name="pos811"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That is not fair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line812"><a name="pos812"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Can you go back. I want to know about that map. I couldn't see it on the TV screen. What was on that map at the beginning of the TV programme?</p>
<p class="line" id="line813"><a name="pos813"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> The area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line814"><a name="pos814"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> What area? What were the boundaries of that area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line815"><a name="pos815"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well the area which we had cordoned off. Earlier in my evidence I stated to you that this was the area of which the borders had been determined by the granting of the freedom of the towns to the various right-wing groups amongst others the BKA, the CP and the AWB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line816"><a name="pos816"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Mr Prinsloo don't make it difficult for me. Just give me the east, west, north and south boundaries.</p>
<p class="line" id="line817"><a name="pos817"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I am explaining so that you can understand precisely how it operated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line818"><a name="pos818"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> What is the southern (...indistinct)</p>
<p class="line" id="line819"><a name="pos819"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Where the southernmost tip of such a freedom of a town would be granted and the northernmost point and the easternmost point and westernmost point, that area which incorporated these towns or that region or those borders, the borders of these towns would determine the borders of the area and it has been indicated as such on the map.</p>
<p class="line" id="line820"><a name="pos820"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> What were the boundaries? Just tell me what was the southern boundary?</p>
<p class="line" id="line821"><a name="pos821"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well I can't answer you regarding that right now.</p>
<p class="line" id="line822"><a name="pos822"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> If I might just interrupt. Which town was at each point? I understand that you say it was the border of that town. Which town therefore was at each point?</p>
<p class="line" id="line823"><a name="pos823"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well the southernmost point I would assume would be Koster.</p>
<p class="line" id="line824"><a name="pos824"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> And the westernmost point?</p>
<p class="line" id="line825"><a name="pos825"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I would estimate that this would be the Brandvlei environment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line826"><a name="pos826"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> The easternmost point?</p>
<p class="line" id="line827"><a name="pos827"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Rustenburg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line828"><a name="pos828"></a><span class="speaker">MR BRACHER:</span> Northernmost point?</p>
<p class="line" id="line829"><a name="pos829"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Schweizer-Reneke and Hoopstad.</p>
<p class="line" id="line830"><a name="pos830"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Sir, have you got any questions left?</p>
<p class="line" id="line831"><a name="pos831"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR BRACHER</p>
<p class="line" id="line832"><a name="pos832"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I would just like to ask you something about this because I can't understand it. On my map Hoopstad is definitely much more south from Koster and from Rustenburg and you have given that as the northernmost point. I think that you should draw a map for us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line833"><a name="pos833"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No, the southernmost point - well let me put it this way, the southernmost point was Schweizer-Reneke.</p>
<p class="line" id="line834"><a name="pos834"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> I beg your pardon but the video which we showed yesterday, the one about the Trimpark meeting upon which the map is clearly indicated perhaps we could watch that video if we could just have a short adjournment to prepare and then we could all have clarity on this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line835"><a name="pos835"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But why can't the witness tell us?</p>
<p class="line" id="line836"><a name="pos836"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Well it appears that he has some problems with his directions. I beg your pardon Chairperson but this is with regard to what Mr Malan said that he should draw a map and I simply feel that in order to save time we could use the video.</p>
<p class="line" id="line837"><a name="pos837"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well let's ask him. What would you say is the southernmost point?</p>
<p class="line" id="line838"><a name="pos838"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well I would say that the southernmost tip would be more east from Ventersdorp. Let's say the Koster area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line839"><a name="pos839"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And the westernmost point?</p>
<p class="line" id="line840"><a name="pos840"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Rustenburg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line841"><a name="pos841"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> East?</p>
<p class="line" id="line842"><a name="pos842"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> The Brandvlei environment.</p>
<p class="line" id="line843"><a name="pos843"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And northernmost point?</p>
<p class="line" id="line844"><a name="pos844"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I am speaking under correction but I can't remember which towns were in that specific area but I would say that it would be approximately in the vicinity of Schweizer-Reneke. The map would stipulate it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line845"><a name="pos845"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Just for clarity. You drew that map. That is what you said to us yesterday. Am I right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line846"><a name="pos846"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, in cooperation with members and information which we received.</p>
<p class="line" id="line847"><a name="pos847"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line848"><a name="pos848"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Chairperson I would just like to ask one more question. I don't know if this witness will be of any more assistance to us. You had orders for operations in PWV area. In other words the Witwatersrand incorporating Pretoria and the Vaal Triangle. In Generals in staff you had a colleague who was your senior in years and experience and in military training and his name was General Japie Oelofse. Other evidence which has been placed before us indicates that he is by nature a military person. So why didn't he receive the orders to carry out these important tasks?</p>
<p class="line" id="line849"><a name="pos849"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Because I was at head-office and I had to do it. I am older than General Japie Oelofse.</p>
<p class="line" id="line850"><a name="pos850"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I am not asking whether or not you are older. I am speaking about his seniority with regard to military expertise and his involvement in operations as well because you were acting as a secretary, as an administrative person and in two weeks all of a sudden your duties are redefined and you receive different tasks. In a short matter of two weeks and it was because of an important issue of preventing the elections and sowing the psychology of fear. Well in terms of experience Japie Oelofse had, had much more experience with this. So why didn't he receive the tasks?</p>
<p class="line" id="line851"><a name="pos851"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Because he had his own region and therefore his own tasks and duties which he had to carry out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line852"><a name="pos852"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> I would also like to ask you, according to other evidence which was placed before us Japie Oelofse was arrested in the beginning of 1994 after a number of bomb explosions. Do you remember that? Do you know anything about that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line853"><a name="pos853"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line854"><a name="pos854"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> When was he released from prison?</p>
<p class="line" id="line855"><a name="pos855"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I think in December 1994 or 1993 he was arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line856"><a name="pos856"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And for how long was he in detention?</p>
<p class="line" id="line857"><a name="pos857"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I can't remember.</p>
<p class="line" id="line858"><a name="pos858"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Was he still in detention when this matter took place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line859"><a name="pos859"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> He spent quite some time in detention and at that point in time he was in detention. I don't know whether or not he was released during that period.</p>
<p class="line" id="line860"><a name="pos860"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But he has given evidence of his being present during this period of time. Are you sure that he was present at Fynbos?</p>
<p class="line" id="line861"><a name="pos861"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I have said that I am speaking under correction. That these members who were present there, whether or not they were definitely there such as amongst others Japie Oelofse would be uncertain for me to give a definite answer about. I know that he spent time in detention with regard to bomb explosions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line862"><a name="pos862"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Why do you say that he had his own region that he was responsible for if he was in detention?</p>
<p class="line" id="line863"><a name="pos863"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> He was in command of Witwatersrand area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line864"><a name="pos864"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But that is my question exactly. Because your area of task was the Witwatersrand area. You would place all your bombs in the Witwatersrand area apart from the one in Pretoria.</p>
<p class="line" id="line865"><a name="pos865"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> We had to operate in the Witwatersrand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line866"><a name="pos866"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> In Japie Oelofse's area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line867"><a name="pos867"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line868"><a name="pos868"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But you were in command in his area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line869"><a name="pos869"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No, I was in command in my area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line870"><a name="pos870"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> To go and operate in his area?</p>
<p class="line" id="line871"><a name="pos871"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That is correct. Those were the orders to operate on the East and West Rand.</p>
<p class="line" id="line872"><a name="pos872"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS CAMBANIS:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  So let us assume for purpose of this question that this was an AWB operation and that the decision to go on indiscriminate killing was taken a couple of weeks before the election. Could you please inform this Committee the decision to go to that form of warfare, when was that decision retracted or has it been retracted by the AWB?</p>
<p class="line" id="line873"><a name="pos873"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well that has always been the viewpoint or the discussion point among others at the staff meetings that members and supporters of the ANC/SACP alliance would be attacked.</p>
<p class="line" id="line874"><a name="pos874"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> Yes, does that decision to carry on this form of warfare to attain this Volkstaat still exist?</p>
<p class="line" id="line875"><a name="pos875"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> At this stage?</p>
<p class="line" id="line876"><a name="pos876"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line877"><a name="pos877"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No, not at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line878"><a name="pos878"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> When was that decision - when was it decided to cease hostility so to speak?</p>
<p class="line" id="line879"><a name="pos879"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> On the day of the election.</p>
<p class="line" id="line880"><a name="pos880"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> When on the day of the election?</p>
<p class="line" id="line881"><a name="pos881"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well I can't remember exactly at what time this took place.</p>
<p class="line" id="line882"><a name="pos882"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Were you part of that decision?</p>
<p class="line" id="line883"><a name="pos883"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> To cease everything?</p>
<p class="line" id="line884"><a name="pos884"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, to cease the policy.</p>
<p class="line" id="line885"><a name="pos885"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> To cessation of the policy of attacking the ANC?</p>
<p class="line" id="line886"><a name="pos886"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes, well that as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line887"><a name="pos887"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> The policy of attacking black people? Well that all formed part of the same thing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line888"><a name="pos888"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well let us call it the terrorism then. Were you part of a meeting during which this decision was made on that day, that day of the election?</p>
<p class="line" id="line889"><a name="pos889"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well this kind of meeting was never held, at least where I was present.</p>
<p class="line" id="line890"><a name="pos890"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Then how do you know that it was ceased?</p>
<p class="line" id="line891"><a name="pos891"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I am speaking under correction but the night before we received communication from a person who was working at head-office. I can't remember exactly what time on the day before the election.</p>
<p class="line" id="line892"><a name="pos892"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was that person credible?</p>
<p class="line" id="line893"><a name="pos893"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well he was a member of the administrative staff.</p>
<p class="line" id="line894"><a name="pos894"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Was he reliable?</p>
<p class="line" id="line895"><a name="pos895"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I believe so, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line896"><a name="pos896"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you believe him?</p>
<p class="line" id="line897"><a name="pos897"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> At that stage I received a report or information that members at the shooting range were arrested or some of them had been arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line898"><a name="pos898"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> When was that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line899"><a name="pos899"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> On the day of the election.</p>
<p class="line" id="line900"><a name="pos900"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I understood you that you received the message the night before the elections that everything is going to be stopped.</p>
<p class="line" id="line901"><a name="pos901"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well on the day of the election, the last bomb that went out, that was the Johannesburg.</p>
<p class="line" id="line902"><a name="pos902"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, when did you receive the message?</p>
<p class="line" id="line903"><a name="pos903"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That evening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line904"><a name="pos904"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The night before the election? Are we talking about that night?</p>
<p class="line" id="line905"><a name="pos905"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No, it was the Monday, the Tuesday we heard about what happened at the shooting range. If you could just help me there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line906"><a name="pos906"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No, let us talk in relation to the elections. As I understood your evidence the evening before the elections a message was sent and it was brought by a person who you trusted.</p>
<p class="line" id="line907"><a name="pos907"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I was in Ventersdorp when I received this message.</p>
<p class="line" id="line908"><a name="pos908"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you believed it and everything was stopped officially. But why the bomb at the airport then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line909"><a name="pos909"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> The persons still went out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line910"><a name="pos910"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why, if everything was stopped under your charge or command?</p>
<p class="line" id="line911"><a name="pos911"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I had not arrived at the shooting range yet ... to the shooting range and that was where Mr Smit them were already arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line912"><a name="pos912"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> From where did the men go when they planted the bomb at the airport?</p>
<p class="line" id="line913"><a name="pos913"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> It had to be from the shooting range in the Rustenburg area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line914"><a name="pos914"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The bomb at the airport was planted the day of the elections.</p>
<p class="line" id="line915"><a name="pos915"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line916"><a name="pos916"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Then why weren't those people stopped then? Because everything was stopped.</p>
<p class="line" id="line917"><a name="pos917"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Because they left early that morning to the airport.</p>
<p class="line" id="line918"><a name="pos918"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But you knew it the previous night and you are in charge of the whole operation. You certainly know where these people are or the men are. Why didn't you tell them to stop and wait?</p>
<p class="line" id="line919"><a name="pos919"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> There was a stage or time as with the members at Koesterfontein that we did not exactly know 24 hours a day where all the members were. The same with the people who would be responsible for the airport.</p>
<p class="line" id="line920"><a name="pos920"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you try and get hold of them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line921"><a name="pos921"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No I cannot remember that, that I tried to get hold of them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line922"><a name="pos922"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Is your answer no?</p>
<p class="line" id="line923"><a name="pos923"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> My answer is no.</p>
<p class="line" id="line924"><a name="pos924"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Can I ask you. Is this the first time the applicants hear of this decision or have they heard about that decision prior to today? It is the first time this Committee hears of that decision.</p>
<p class="line" id="line925"><a name="pos925"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> What decision?</p>
<p class="line" id="line926"><a name="pos926"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> That everything must be stopped. Well at least the evening before the elections.</p>
<p class="line" id="line927"><a name="pos927"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> The evening before the Johannesburg airport incident there was talk that everything must be stopped because there will be arrests.</p>
<p class="line" id="line928"><a name="pos928"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> No it wasn't just talk. Everything was stopped. You knew about this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line929"><a name="pos929"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That was the order yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line930"><a name="pos930"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The question that my colleague asked was the applicants did they know about this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line931"><a name="pos931"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I believe that a very few of them knew.</p>
<p class="line" id="line932"><a name="pos932"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> They fall under your command. Why didn't they know?</p>
<p class="line" id="line933"><a name="pos933"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That is correct, yes. Brigadier Leon van der Merwe and co-commanders would have done this task and then convey it to the different groups. Amongst others the Ystergaarde at the game farm or shooting range.</p>
<p class="line" id="line934"><a name="pos934"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Prinsloo we are not playing rugby now. This is important. Peoples' lives are at stake here. Including the applicants' lives. You are the boss of a certain area, applicants fall under your command in your area. Why wasn't any attempts made to inform them about the fact that you are going to stop fighting this war?</p>
<p class="line" id="line935"><a name="pos935"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I personally did not do it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line936"><a name="pos936"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I know but why?</p>
<p class="line" id="line937"><a name="pos937"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> It was [intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line938"><a name="pos938"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Or did you want them to continue with this war irrespective of this decision.</p>
<p class="line" id="line939"><a name="pos939"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line940"><a name="pos940"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Can I just come in here. I heard the witness said that they must stop everything because they will be arrested because the reason why he stopped everything it was not to prevent any further loss of life but not to be caught or arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line941"><a name="pos941"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> It could be.</p>
<p class="line" id="line942"><a name="pos942"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> No I am asking you. You must decide. You said that the message came through; "Stop everything, people will be arrested." In other words: "Do not continue with the operations, we are in dangerous grounds now." Is that true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line943"><a name="pos943"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line944"><a name="pos944"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> But you must decide stop everything as the chairman understand what you said. "Do not go further and kill people, it is not the right thing any more. The elections will continue, we can do nothing about it." Or was the decision; "Stop everything, get away, the police will arrest us, look after yourself." What was the message that you received that evening?</p>
<p class="line" id="line945"><a name="pos945"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well it was not that clear or pertinent. "Stop everything because you will be locked up." The main reason was obviously that there will be arrests but that the people must break up and go and hide in that area.</p>
<p class="line" id="line946"><a name="pos946"></a><span class="speaker">MALAN:</span> That was now the end of the operation in the</p>
<p class="line" id="line947"><a name="pos947"></a>interests of the people who took part in this operation.</p>
<p class="line" id="line948"><a name="pos948"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line949"><a name="pos949"></a><span class="speaker">MALAN:</span> It wasn't a humane decision. "We must now stop killing innocent people."</p>
<p class="line" id="line950"><a name="pos950"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line951"><a name="pos951"></a><span class="speaker">MALAN:</span> So much more then the Chairperson asked you and the way he understand it and I still do not know what is the truth. If the instruction was to stop everything in order not to take further lives why didn't you convey this message: "Tell these people that we must not continue killing innocent people"? But I will put it to you differently. If you understood it in that it would be in the interests of the men who will be arrested why didn't you immediately drive from the farm and tell them? I do not know what this afrikaans term means but why didn't you tell them: "Get away from here, the police are onto you."</p>
<p class="line" id="line952"><a name="pos952"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Most of the members were then already - they weren't at the shooting range any more. There were some members there and I am talking under correction. Mr van der Merwe made contact to us by phone in the Rustenburg area. I know some of the people phoned us during that night and said people were already arrested in the Rustenburg area and Koster area but specifically on the farm I cannot say. I know that it was at least four or five 'o clock in the morning when the people were or would have been arrested and that was from the previous evening.</p>
<p class="line" id="line953"><a name="pos953"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mr Prinsloo I will undertake not to ask further questions to you but the picture in my head is that you suddenly became a combat general with responsibilities in this position. You have never done this before in your whole life. You get an area, certain things had to be done. You say that you delegate some of your powers. Myburg and Barnard clearly takes initiative for which you did not give them instructions but they started it and you are satisfied. You said Barnard is an expert, he will do the work and you are satisfied that the work is in good hands. I would put it to you that you were only in charge in name and you had no control of what was going on. I would like to hear your comment then I will stop asking questions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line954"><a name="pos954"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I did have definite control and command over these people amongst others a person Koper Myburg and Cliff Barnard, the members at Koesterfontein who was also present there would under no circumstances make use of their own agenda without myself, Brigadier Leon van der Merwe and the other co-commanders and the Generals in Staff and Eugene Terreblanche's permission.</p>
<p class="line" id="line955"><a name="pos955"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Mr Prinsloo what is the military background of these generals? What military training did you receive?</p>
<p class="line" id="line956"><a name="pos956"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I was in South West. I acted operationally.</p>
<p class="line" id="line957"><a name="pos957"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> What was your rank in the defence force?</p>
<p class="line" id="line958"><a name="pos958"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I was a KO.</p>
<p class="line" id="line959"><a name="pos959"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> What is a KO?</p>
<p class="line" id="line960"><a name="pos960"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Warrant officer. I was Katima Malibu based, stationed or stationed there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line961"><a name="pos961"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> And what was General Roodt's rank when he was involved?</p>
<p class="line" id="line962"><a name="pos962"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I can't answer that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line963"><a name="pos963"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Cruywagen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line964"><a name="pos964"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I do not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line965"><a name="pos965"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Oelofse?</p>
<p class="line" id="line966"><a name="pos966"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I do not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line967"><a name="pos967"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Ackerman, Dirk Ackerman?</p>
<p class="line" id="line968"><a name="pos968"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line969"><a name="pos969"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> You see what worries me is that if these generals were not really generals but you said that you cannot help us with this. How well trained were they? Military trained.</p>
<p class="line" id="line970"><a name="pos970"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> The generals were well trained. They were also warrant officers or one of them was also a warrant officer in the police. They were well trained. If there was a shortage the generals would make use of specialised people in the South African Police or then South African Defence Force.</p>
<p class="line" id="line971"><a name="pos971"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Just one more question then I will stop. On what basis were generals appointed?</p>
<p class="line" id="line972"><a name="pos972"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well according to the members he had under his command. He had to move through specific structures in the AWB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line973"><a name="pos973"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> In other words not for his military background and expertise?</p>
<p class="line" id="line974"><a name="pos974"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No, not in all cases but we did have generals who was in charge of the culture and recreation and these type of things.</p>
<p class="line" id="line975"><a name="pos975"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> Can you please assist us with details. It is 4 years down the line, who and when did they decide to cease hostilities in this form of indiscriminate killing of civilians? You have had 4 years to find this out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line976"><a name="pos976"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No, it was definitely not 4 years for me to find this out. The day we stopped all action with warfare was when we saw that it served no purpose. No financial gain but we remained where we were and where we did not want to be. When we realised that the ANC did or will win the elections and it can be proven we stopped all actions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line977"><a name="pos977"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But you knew months before that the ANC will win. You even said so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line978"><a name="pos978"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line979"><a name="pos979"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But why do you say now that just when you found out that the ANC will win you stopped?</p>
<p class="line" id="line980"><a name="pos980"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> We always hoped that somewhere we would be accommodated.</p>
<p class="line" id="line981"><a name="pos981"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> But Sir as you know Mr Barnard and Mr Myburg did not cease any hostilities.</p>
<p class="line" id="line982"><a name="pos982"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well these two people were driven by circumstances. The fact that they just like the other applicants they did not do it for their own personal gain but they did it for something that they believed in. These people escaped from detention. They sent an urgent message to the Minister of Justice where they requested or asked him that amnesty will be given as well as not these specific applicants but other applicants across the country. That amnesty will be given to them and at that stage there was no talk of amnesty and they acted out of anger against the system and then acted again in the Worcester area. Not that I am agreeing with what they did or then the AWB but they were forced into those circumstances.</p>
<p class="line" id="line983"><a name="pos983"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> They were forced to detonate a bomb in a shopping centre?</p>
<p class="line" id="line984"><a name="pos984"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line985"><a name="pos985"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Didn't they do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line986"><a name="pos986"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, they did it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line987"><a name="pos987"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And you say the circumstances forced them to do it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line988"><a name="pos988"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well I am not saying or when I give evidence that it wasn't the right thing to do. We already lost the war.</p>
<p class="line" id="line989"><a name="pos989"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> And when they carried out with exactly the same modus operandi at Worcester that was not in the name of the AWB. Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line990"><a name="pos990"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That is correct, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line991"><a name="pos991"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> And in fact there is nothing, they have not appeared before this Committee, there is nothing to suggest to this Committee that when they acted at Koesterfontein it also was not in the name of the AWB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line992"><a name="pos992"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS CAMBANIS</p>
<p class="line" id="line993"><a name="pos993"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> It was in the name of the AWB.</p>
<p class="line" id="line994"><a name="pos994"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR LANDMAN:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman, just a few questions. Mr Prinsloo wouldn't you say that Mr Barnard was the best trained person in the AWB what do you mean? What training did he have?</p>
<p class="line" id="line995"><a name="pos995"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> What was given to me or the information I received was that he indicated that he was a highly trained person. Whether it was in the defence force and South African Police.</p>
<p class="line" id="line996"><a name="pos996"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> What training did he have? What sort of training did he have?</p>
<p class="line" id="line997"><a name="pos997"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> It was specialised training that he received in explosives amongst others sniper work, self-defence and so forth. I cannot specifically say what courses he completed during his training.</p>
<p class="line" id="line998"><a name="pos998"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> So as far as you were concerned he was able to assemble a bomb. Is that right?</p>
<p class="line" id="line999"><a name="pos999"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I believe so. I believe he could do it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1000"><a name="pos1000"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> As far as you were concerned could he assemble a car bomb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1001"><a name="pos1001"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, that is possible.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1002"><a name="pos1002"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Well did he ever say that he couldn't do that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1003"><a name="pos1003"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No, he never said that he cannot do it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1004"><a name="pos1004"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Can you explain why he had to get Mr Koekermoer to come assist him in assembling the car bomb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1005"><a name="pos1005"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> There are finer details that went before this because after the building of such a bomb there are certain details that have to be adhered to for example the placing of the fuses, what type of fuses to use, delaying fuses or whatever mechanisms had to be used and if Mr Barnard knew about the latest technology I do not know.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1006"><a name="pos1006"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Mr Prinsloo where were you when you gave Mr Barnard the instruction to explode the first bomb on the Saturday in Johannesburg, sorry on the Sunday in Johannesburg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1007"><a name="pos1007"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I was in the Ventersdorp district.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1008"><a name="pos1008"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Were you at headquarters or where were you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1009"><a name="pos1009"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well we were in the town area. I cannot say specifically that I was at head-office. It was in that area, in that immediate area of the head-office.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1010"><a name="pos1010"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Was your instructions to him that he should plant a car bomb or merely a bomb of some sort?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1011"><a name="pos1011"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well I can remember that we discussed that the bomb should be placed. It was also a proposal from his side that it should be a vehicle bomb. But as I have said we discussed it. General Ackerman also suggested that it should not be easy for the security police to detect it. If not anything else other than specifically a vehicle bomb.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1012"><a name="pos1012"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> What I want to know from you, your instruction to Barnard was it to place a car bomb in Johannesburg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1013"><a name="pos1013"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> As I have said to you I received the order that it should be a motor bomb. However, if it should not be realistically feasible for Mr Barnard we would have to devise another plan. As I have said we did discuss it and he then acquired a vehicle with which or wherein which he built a car bomb.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1014"><a name="pos1014"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Did he tell that he had found a car?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1015"><a name="pos1015"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1016"><a name="pos1016"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> When did he tell you that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1017"><a name="pos1017"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I can't remember specifically. I am trying but I can't recall specifically.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1018"><a name="pos1018"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Did he tell you who was going to be part of his group who would carry out this car bomb attack?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1019"><a name="pos1019"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> He mentioned that a person by the name of Myburg would be with him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1020"><a name="pos1020"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Do you remember when that discussion took place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1021"><a name="pos1021"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No. I can't.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1022"><a name="pos1022"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Can I just very quickly take you back to the vehicle. Now you were supposed to supply those vehicles, yes? For the bombs, for bombs to be made in?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1023"><a name="pos1023"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No, negative.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1024"><a name="pos1024"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Unless I don't understand this very well. You know page 60 of Volume 1, Mr Le Roux again if I am not wrong, says that he assumes that you would make sure that cars would be provided so that bombs could be built in it but this was not realised. It is page 60. I am just paraphrasing it. It is a very short sentence. So he was part of the Johannesburg bomb group. You know nothing about that paragraph 21? Just read it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1025"><a name="pos1025"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No I have read it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1026"><a name="pos1026"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> So you saying you knew nothing about it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1027"><a name="pos1027"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No, it could be that he intended that the patrols be carried out in four by four vehicles. Is that not what he could have been referring to.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1028"><a name="pos1028"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So what he heard was wrong then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1029"><a name="pos1029"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Definitely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1030"><a name="pos1030"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1031"><a name="pos1031"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Thank you and apart from planting a bomb in Johannesburg on the Sunday did you give him any other instructions at the same time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1032"><a name="pos1032"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> At that stage I don't believe that I received any other instructions.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1033"><a name="pos1033"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> As far as he was concerned he had only one task and that was to plant the bomb in Johannesburg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1034"><a name="pos1034"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> At that stage, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1035"><a name="pos1035"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Did you give him [intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1036"><a name="pos1036"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Naturally I did inform him that more things had to happen but I don't recall that we specifically discussed that there in terms of who had to go where and what still had to be carried out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1037"><a name="pos1037"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> When you say further things what - did you tell him what sort of things had to happen?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1038"><a name="pos1038"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No. As I have just said to you I can't remember specifically what I would have said to him with regard to specific things which still had to take place. I definitely told him or informed him about the fact that he had to plant a car bomb in Johannesburg. We discussed that. If he had said: "Yes but a car bomb isn't going to work let's rather use a limpet mine." We would have discussed it and I would have taken this up with the Generals in Staff.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1039"><a name="pos1039"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Now when did you tell him or give him instructions to plant the bomb in Germiston?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1040"><a name="pos1040"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well, he didn't plant the bomb in Germiston.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1041"><a name="pos1041"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Did you not ask him to prepare that bomb?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1042"><a name="pos1042"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, he was informed that he should  or that he was responsible for the checking of the bomb and that would include the pipe bombs as well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1043"><a name="pos1043"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Did you give him instructions that after the bomb exploded in Johannesburg that he was to ensure that bombs exploded on a regular basis thereafter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1044"><a name="pos1044"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, we discussed it at a certain stage but when I said this to him I informed him that this must continue. The Staff had said it was good, we should just continue like that. I didn't specifically say: "Okay now you are going on that specific day and you are going to do something similar."</p>
<p class="line" id="line1045"><a name="pos1045"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> I want to put it to you that the bomb in Bree Street was not planted in an attempt to stop the elections and that is apparent from the fact that the AWB never demanded that the elections be stopped after that bomb took place, after that explosion occurred.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1046"><a name="pos1046"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1047"><a name="pos1047"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> It wasn't connected with a demand that: "You have now seen what we can do. You must now stop these elections." You never made that demand and I want to put it to you it is clear from that that, that bomb wasn't planted in order to stop the elections.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1048"><a name="pos1048"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Then why would we have done it? For which reason? I don't understand what you are getting at.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1049"><a name="pos1049"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Isn't it so that for months before that you were planning a war and you were planning to succeed from the rest of South Africa and form your Volkstaat in the Western Transvaal. Isn't that so?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1050"><a name="pos1050"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1051"><a name="pos1051"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> So you were planning for a war. Not to stop the election. Weren't you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1052"><a name="pos1052"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> But then why would we want to wage a war? What would we want to achieve then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1053"><a name="pos1053"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> The speaker's microphone is not on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1054"><a name="pos1054"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1055"><a name="pos1055"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Not to stop the elections?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1056"><a name="pos1056"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No, that is not entirely correct. We wanted to thwart the elections. We wanted them to accommodate us in a certain way and we would commit succession in the Volkstaat if Dr Ferdie Hartzenberg were to announce it.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1057"><a name="pos1057"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> Mr Prinsloo surely you realised by the middle of April 1994 that these elections were going to take place no matter what.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1058"><a name="pos1058"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No we had not yet realised that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1059"><a name="pos1059"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why? I mean you are all grown men.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1060"><a name="pos1060"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> We still believed Chairperson that a compromise could be arrived at.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1061"><a name="pos1061"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you believe that you could win a war in this country?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1062"><a name="pos1062"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Definitely yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1063"><a name="pos1063"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But how?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1064"><a name="pos1064"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Because we had the means to do so.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1065"><a name="pos1065"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And when you discovered that Viljoen had left and that things wouldn't be as easy as what you thought they would be, what then?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1066"><a name="pos1066"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well Chairperson his soldiers were still extremely positive about everything. The army and its staff personally invited me, Mr Terreblanche and a large group of right-wingers to the Cape where we visited the air force base at Ysterplaat where we visited the Naval Bases. We visited Oudtshoorn. I was lead through the Western Transvaal with Mr Terreblanche to investigate stockpiling locations which had been established.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1067"><a name="pos1067"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And this never realised?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1068"><a name="pos1068"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1069"><a name="pos1069"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And we can say it now, I think you could have said it then a few days before the election you could have seen that this was not going to work out.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1070"><a name="pos1070"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> We still believed that it would.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1071"><a name="pos1071"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> All of you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1072"><a name="pos1072"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> All of us.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1073"><a name="pos1073"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> How long before the election did these visits to the bases take place?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1074"><a name="pos1074"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I am speaking under correction but probably within a period of 5 to 6 months or 4 months.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1075"><a name="pos1075"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> That was before Viljoen left?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1076"><a name="pos1076"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Long before he left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1077"><a name="pos1077"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> I would like to ask a question. If you believed you could win this war why did you give up so quickly as soon as the first two or three people were arrested? Just put those two things together for me?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1078"><a name="pos1078"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Everyone was arrested without - well many of the men's rights were not read to them and people were arrested without really having had anything to do with the bomb explosion.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1079"><a name="pos1079"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Prinsloo apart from the fact that judges rules were not read to those who were arrested what did that have to do with the fact that you withdrew from a war which you believed in after two or three arrests? If you commit war or if you make war then the possibility exists of ...[inaudible]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1080"><a name="pos1080"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Chairperson, that day at the shooting range all members who were present were arrested in a question of half an hour or let's say 50 people were arrested.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1081"><a name="pos1081"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why would you withdraw if only 50 people had been arrested?  You were busy with a big war with which you would take over the country?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1082"><a name="pos1082"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> It was then that we saw that no demands had been put forward by our leaders.  General Constand Viljoen had participated in the election, Dr Ferdie Hartzenberg said that he should be accommodated within the new dispensation and there was nothing left for us to continue with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1083"><a name="pos1083"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> But then, Mr Prinsloo, I'm rather confused or one of us is confused because earlier you testified that the reason why the withdrawal took place was the arrests and you wanted to assist most of the men.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1084"><a name="pos1084"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1085"><a name="pos1085"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> It had nothing to do with the leadership or what they did or what they didn't do?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1086"><a name="pos1086"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1087"><a name="pos1087"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> So what's the truth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1088"><a name="pos1088"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> The fact that people were locked up, men were anxious, there was chaos everywhere throughout the entire country.  People began to flee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1089"><a name="pos1089"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Who told you that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1090"><a name="pos1090"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> It was that way.  Many right-wingers fled, some of them are still gone.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1091"><a name="pos1091"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Right-wingers?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1092"><a name="pos1092"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, right-wingers.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1093"><a name="pos1093"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Very well.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1094"><a name="pos1094"></a><span class="speaker">MR LANDMAN:</span> You see, Mr Prinsloo, I want to put it to you that at the end of your evidence, it's still unclear as to why the bomb was planted in Bree Street.  You still haven't given a satisfactory explanation.  Mr Chairman, in the light of the need for full disclosure, I would have hoped but I've lost hope.  Yes that was to be my last question.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1095"><a name="pos1095"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR LANDMAN</p>
<p class="line" id="line1096"><a name="pos1096"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR KRIEL:</span> Mr Prinsloo, there is one aspect and I promised you this morning in chambers that there would be one aspect.  Fyndooring - there was Generals in Staff meeting at Fyndooring.  If I understand it correctly it was decided at Fyndooring that these bombs would be planted.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1097"><a name="pos1097"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That is correct, more specifically the Johannesburg bombing.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1098"><a name="pos1098"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> Mr Terreblanche the leader was present at that Generals in Staff meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1099"><a name="pos1099"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1100"><a name="pos1100"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> During which it was decided to plant bombs and he expressed his approval for this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1101"><a name="pos1101"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1102"><a name="pos1102"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> And you also gave your approval?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1103"><a name="pos1103"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1104"><a name="pos1104"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> Therefore I accept that you would be prepared to accept responsibility for the bombs which exploded thereafter?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1105"><a name="pos1105"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> What do you mean?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1106"><a name="pos1106"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> Sir, you were part of a decision making mechanism and it was decided to plant bombs and I'm asking you whether or not you accept responsibility for those bombs which you did explode afterwards?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1107"><a name="pos1107"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1108"><a name="pos1108"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> And Mr Terreblanche was directly involved in that and he also expressed his approval for those bombs which were to go off?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1109"><a name="pos1109"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1110"><a name="pos1110"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> And therefore he was directly responsible for the bombs which exploded?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1111"><a name="pos1111"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1112"><a name="pos1112"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> Then finally, I would like to read something to you and ask for your commentary regarding Mr Terreblanche's affidavit, it's the last paragraph</p>
<blockquote class="line" id="line1113"><a name="pos1113"></a>"As political head of the AWB I accept political and moral responsibility for deeds which were committed.  I accept that during a stormy period before the elections I made many public speeches and the content of my speeches was interpreted by the AWB and it could have been interpreted as orders."</blockquote>
<p class="line" id="line1114"><a name="pos1114"></a>Now I'm asking for your commentary regarding this paragraph from Mr Terreblanche's affidavit and you have just testified that there was a specific meeting which took place, a meeting of the Generals in Staff, during which he gave his specific approval.  Your commentary please?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1115"><a name="pos1115"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well what can you say?  It was a great pity to us that all commanders could not have stood up and accepted responsibility including Mr Terreblanche.  The fact that he would have said that it could have been interpreted as an order from him in his public speeches is in my opinion merely an attempt ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1116"><a name="pos1116"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> I'm sorry for interrupting you but do you agree that what Mr Terreblanche has written here is not the truth?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1117"><a name="pos1117"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1118"><a name="pos1118"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1119"><a name="pos1119"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Why would we not argue that that is also the truth, not relating to this incident but I mean generally?   Could be?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1120"><a name="pos1120"></a><span class="speaker">MR KRIEL:</span> Thank you Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1121"><a name="pos1121"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MR KRIEL</p>

<p class="line" id="line1123"><a name="pos1123"></a>	Mr Prinsloo, the trailer which was used during the Germiston bomb incident, was the trailer fetched from your home?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1124"><a name="pos1124"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1125"><a name="pos1125"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And do you know whether Mr Terreblanche at any stage was informed that his trailer was used?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1126"><a name="pos1126"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes he was.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1127"><a name="pos1127"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> What was his reaction?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1128"><a name="pos1128"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I can't say definitely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1129"><a name="pos1129"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Well was he angry?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1130"><a name="pos1130"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes he was angry.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1131"><a name="pos1131"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Did he scold those who were involved?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1132"><a name="pos1132"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes he would definitely have scolded them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1133"><a name="pos1133"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Just a final aspect.  Yesterday you gave evidence that the AWB from time to time at various groups provided advice?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1134"><a name="pos1134"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1135"><a name="pos1135"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Specifically in the Cape you went to see a number of people and explained the AWB structures to them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1136"><a name="pos1136"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1137"><a name="pos1137"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Who were those people?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1138"><a name="pos1138"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Those were members of the Coloured Corps.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1139"><a name="pos1139"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> In the army?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1140"><a name="pos1140"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No, they were civilians.  Members of the former District Six, these were coloured people, people like you and me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1141"><a name="pos1141"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> You refer to the Coloured Corps.  Was that an organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1142"><a name="pos1142"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Well that's what they called themselves.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1143"><a name="pos1143"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Does it still exist as an organisation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1144"><a name="pos1144"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1156"><a name="pos1156"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1157"><a name="pos1157"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And you yourself, when on the day of the election were you arrested?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1158"><a name="pos1158"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> It was during the morning hours.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1159"><a name="pos1159"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Was that during the early morning hours?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1163"><a name="pos1163"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And according to the evidence which was delivered in the court case with regard to the bomb which went out to Jan Smuts, you were present when that evidence was delivered?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1167"><a name="pos1167"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> According to the evidence it was during the early morning hours, approximately just after two o'clock.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1168"><a name="pos1168"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I'll accept that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1169"><a name="pos1169"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> You also said that discussions were held with regards to a report which you gave to Ventersdorp regarding members who had been arrested in possession of explosives.  Are you referring to those who went to Benoni?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1170"><a name="pos1170"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1171"><a name="pos1171"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> It was also put to you whether or not you know about the agreement which would have been embodied in the constitution.

<p class="line" id="line1173"><a name="pos1173"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And it was not complied with?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1174"><a name="pos1174"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1175"><a name="pos1175"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> No further questions, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1176"><a name="pos1176"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS VAN DER WALT</p>
<p class="line" id="line1177"><a name="pos1177"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Just one or two questions.  If you go to page 134 of Volume 1, Mr Abie Fourie's statement and I'm looking here at paragraph 24.  Paragraph 24 page 134 and he talks about a meeting that you attended along with some of your other colleagues.  Was this meeting before the generals - the visiting generals arrived or after they had left?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1178"><a name="pos1178"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> The meeting in the cubicle?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1179"><a name="pos1179"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Well I was hoping you could tell me, I don't know whether it was a cubicle meeting or at a different venue but the one Mr Fourie refers to here.  Was it before the visiting generals came or after they had left this meeting?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1180"><a name="pos1180"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No that was before their arrival.  Well we were actually still busy with the meeting when some of the persons arrived there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1181"><a name="pos1181"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> You see what ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1182"><a name="pos1182"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> I beg your pardon.  Some of the generals also spoke to Mr Barnard and I assume also with Mr Myburgh but I can't say precisely.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1183"><a name="pos1183"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> You see what interests me here is the "kwesie van die gooi van die pypbomme is bespreek", he says here.  Now was that when the generals were there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1184"><a name="pos1184"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1185"><a name="pos1185"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Was that before the generals arrived?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1186"><a name="pos1186"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1187"><a name="pos1187"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Was the decision that you then took about the pipe bombs communicated to the generals?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1188"><a name="pos1188"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes, always.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1189"><a name="pos1189"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> No, no, no, don't tell me about always.  The specific generals who were there on that day, I want to confine it to that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1190"><a name="pos1190"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1191"><a name="pos1191"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> And that's when you got your "goedkeuring", they approved?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1192"><a name="pos1192"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> Yes it was discussed with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1193"><a name="pos1193"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Did you obtain the approval or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1194"><a name="pos1194"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> We had the approval to continue.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1195"><a name="pos1195"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Now that approval, was this the first time they had heard of the pipe bombs plan, the plan to set these bombs off or had they known about these issues before they came to the farm?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1196"><a name="pos1196"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> No they had known about it for quite some time before because Mr Andre Smit, the explosives General, Andre Smit, made some of the explosives available.</p>

Mrs Ngwenya, is it correct that after consultation with myself and Mr ...[indistinct] we've prepared a statement which you read on - I think on Friday and attested and which I've now handed in to the Commission?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1213"><a name="pos1213"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NGWENYA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1214"><a name="pos1214"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> And the first three paragraphs thereof relate just to details of reference numbers for the purposes of Reparation Committee, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1215"><a name="pos1215"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NGWENYA:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1216"><a name="pos1216"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Could we just receive copies of the statement we did not receive yet?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1217"><a name="pos1217"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> Thank you Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1218"><a name="pos1218"></a>	Now you were present in Bree Street on the 24th April, I see there's a typing error, 1998.  Should be 1994 the day of the explosion in Bree Street, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1219"><a name="pos1219"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NGWENYA:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1220"><a name="pos1220"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> Please will you tell the Committee in your own words what you remember and what happened as a result of that explosion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1221"><a name="pos1221"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NGWENYA:</span> It was in the morning on Sunday on the 24th April 1994.  I left my home, I went to work in the corner Bree and King George Street.  Early in the morning at about past nine we were waiting there at the corner of Bree and Wanderers.  There were policemen there and they were searching people.  After that, it didn't take long, the bomb exploded in Bree Street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1222"><a name="pos1222"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> And what is the next thing you remember Mrs Ngwenya?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1223"><a name="pos1223"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NGWENYA:</span> After the explosion I was taken to hospital.  I couldn't see much.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1224"><a name="pos1224"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> And is it correct that as a result of this explosion you sustained injuries to your jaw and to your leg?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1225"><a name="pos1225"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NGWENYA:</span> Yes it's correct, I even have letters from hospital.  I can't eat nicely, I'm being injured, I can't even walk nicely, I can't work for my children.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1226"><a name="pos1226"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> And that you've had a series of operations all of which have been unsuccessful?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1227"><a name="pos1227"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NGWENYA:</span> Yes I had a series of operations and I also underwent an operation where a bone in my hip was removed and another bone was put in my jaw - it didn't work.  I have an iron and I'm going to die like this.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1228"><a name="pos1228"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> And ma'am on Monday of this hearing, you were unable to attend this hearing because you once again had to be admitted to hospital for treatment to your jaw.  Is that correct?  Yesterday?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1229"><a name="pos1229"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NGWENYA:</span> Yes that is correct.  There's a possibility that on Friday I'll be admitted in hospital because they're still trying.  There's part of my flesh which has been removed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1230"><a name="pos1230"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> Mrs Ngwenya, we've annexed for the Committee copies of a letter from the Department of Justice dated 1994 which is the time at which you began enquiring about opposing any applications for amnesty in this connection, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1231"><a name="pos1231"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NGWENYA:</span> Yes that is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1232"><a name="pos1232"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> Would you please tell the Committee in your own words why it is that you are opposing amnesty for these applicants?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1233"><a name="pos1233"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NGWENYA:</span> First of all they've realised that they've injured people in Bree Street.  They continued doing these acts, they don't have a conscience.  They liked doing this and they enjoyed seeing us suffering for being black.  They were fighting blacks, like they said they were targeting blacks at the taxi ranks.  There's no taxi rank in Bree Street, there's no taxi rank there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1234"><a name="pos1234"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> Mrs Ngwenya, finally - is there anything further you would like to tell or ask the Committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1235"><a name="pos1235"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NGWENYA:</span> Bree Street is far from ANC offices.  There's nothing that anyone can come and fight or politicians in Bree Street are very far.  They just looked for blacks and they were fighting blacks, that's all they were looking for.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1236"><a name="pos1236"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> Thank you Mr Chair, there's nothing further.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1248"><a name="pos1248"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS VAN DER WALT:</span> This statement of yours that was handed over to us - in paragraph 11 you say that you oppose this application and then you say "I do not believe the applicants have told the truth about who was involved in the bombing."  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1249"><a name="pos1249"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NGWENYA:</span> ...[inaudible]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1250"><a name="pos1250"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> In your statement you say that you oppose this application and then I'm going to read to you what it says there</p>

<p class="line" id="line1252"><a name="pos1252"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NGWENYA:</span> There is no truth about whatever they have said.  I can't tell their truth even if I'm trying to follow up their statements, I can't tell the truth there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1253"><a name="pos1253"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> I read from your statement.  You say that they do not tell the truth about who was involved in the bombing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1254"><a name="pos1254"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NGWENYA:</span> That's what I'm saying.  That's what I'm saying that they aren't telling the truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1255"><a name="pos1255"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> You said they do not know who was responsible for it or did your attorney insert that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1256"><a name="pos1256"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NGWENYA:</span> I'm hearing this on my own, I can tell it's not the truth.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1257"><a name="pos1257"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Why do you say that they are not talking the truth and that they are saying that they are not involved or not responsible?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1258"><a name="pos1258"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NGWENYA:</span> Because they said their targets were the taxi ranks and Bree is far from a taxi rank.  Bree Street is far from the taxi rank and it's not the centre of the city.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1259"><a name="pos1259"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Isn't the statement saying that she alleges that the applicants were not involved?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1260"><a name="pos1260"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> The way I see it is ...[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1261"><a name="pos1261"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> The word "all" does not have to be there but if you take the word "all" in the second line and you change it to "who" then it makes sense.  "Who all" were involved.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1262"><a name="pos1262"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> You oppose this application.  I understand that you were injured and I do sympathise with you but if I understand your evidence then you do not want to reconcile either.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1263"><a name="pos1263"></a><span class="speaker">MRS NGWENYA:</span> Yes that is correct.  I've suffered a lot and I'm going to go to my grave like this.  I also want them to suffer the same.  I will suffer like this until I die.  I want them to remain in prison.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1264"><a name="pos1264"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> You are not willing like the parents of Amy Biehl who also suffered and where Amy Biehl was killed because she was a white woman, you are not willing to, like those parents, reconcile yourself with what happened.  Is that true?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1283"><a name="pos1283"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> Please proceed.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1284"><a name="pos1284"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHUMALO:</span> I parked my car at Bree Street.  It was cold.  I went to Morkels.  I saw a car coming and there was smoke coming from this car.  I can't remember whether there were two people but they started waving their hands.  After that or after two minutes a bomb exploded.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1285"><a name="pos1285"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> Were you injured as a result of that explosion?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1286"><a name="pos1286"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHUMALO:</span> Yes, I had head injuries, my legs and my foot.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1289"><a name="pos1289"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> Mr Chair, I see in paragraph 8 the last two lines, that I've coined a new term which I apologise for - it's "reason."</p>
<p class="line" id="line1290"><a name="pos1290"></a>	Mr Khumalo, your instructions are that you oppose the applications of these applicants.  Is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1291"><a name="pos1291"></a><span class="speaker">MR KHUMALO:</span> Yes that's correct.  I can't forgive these people because even my car was not insured.  I don't have a car today.</p>

It is correct that your family member, the late Ms Fani, was killed in the bomb blast that took place in Bree Street.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1307"><a name="pos1307"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SEAKO:</span> That is correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1308"><a name="pos1308"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> And Mrs Seako, there was certain views that you have regarding the applications for amnesty, why you are opposing the applications.  Would you please tell the Committee what those are?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1309"><a name="pos1309"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SEAKO:</span> Yes I can.  One thing that makes me not so forgiving is that in whatever they have said so far there is no truth.  Thokosile, the one who died, caused her mother's death as well and General Hospital lost - she was a radiographer.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1310"><a name="pos1310"></a>	Secondly, they planted this bomb deliberately with hatred because they hate a black person.  The truth is that I would love to see the person who actually planted the bomb there and the reason that made him to hate people like this, to hate blacks and claim the land to be theirs as AWB members.  Why would they fight like the Russians?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1311"><a name="pos1311"></a>	Thirdly, what made them go to the hotel and ask them if they were open and whatever hatred they have even when two kids told him that "Mr, that car that you've parked outside there, it's burning"  - he answered them and said to them "that car is not burning but there's a bomb inside that car" and these kids have no one who can come here to talk on behalf of them because they were street kids.  At least some, we are here, to represent them but those kids were street kids, they died there and no one is here to speak on their behalf.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1312"><a name="pos1312"></a>	I lost my job.  Those kids were suffering and these kids asked them, in fact they were trying to help them.  They said "your car was burning" and he actually answered them back and said "it's not burning, but there's a bomb inside."  You ask yourself if such a person has a conscience.  You don't even know why those street kids are on the street.  They are not belonging in any party with the ANC or whatsoever.  I would ask for forgiveness from the Lord because I don't have forgiveness to give to these people because I still feel for those kids who died on those streets and they were not buried decently because they were street kids.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1313"><a name="pos1313"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> Mrs Seako, is it correct that you attended a large part of the criminal proceedings against these applicants?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1314"><a name="pos1314"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SEAKO:</span> Yes I was attending, it's true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1315"><a name="pos1315"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> And what - how did you find the attitude of the applicants at that trial?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1316"><a name="pos1316"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SEAKO:</span> They were feeling happy, they didn't show any remorse and it was like a joke to them.  I remember the first day I wanted to pray before the court.  They asked to pray before the court proceedings and I was amazed that people like them, people with no conscience, know how to pray.  We were a joke in the court.  I remember one nice gentleman.   He was tall and if I'm not mistaken, that guy his name is Koekemoer and I think that guy had a bit of a conscience.  The rest were very cold and they were very happy, they were laughing at us.  I remember one day I sat in one chair, I think the third or the second chair behind the magistrate.  They kicked me out, they said they didn't want to sit next to me until one policeman said "this is a court, it's not belonging to the AWB."  Even that made me feel that these people show no remorse and they are so cold.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1317"><a name="pos1317"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> And Mrs Seako, during the proceedings before this Committee was it your experience that they had a similar attitude?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1318"><a name="pos1318"></a><span class="speaker">MR PRINSLOO:</span> With respect, Mr Chairman, it's a leading question she's putting the answer in front of the witness.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1319"><a name="pos1319"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> Well, I at the time raised it, I place it on record that I had instructions from clients about attitude in this hall and that is why I put it that way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1320"><a name="pos1320"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well let's put it this way.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1321"><a name="pos1321"></a>	Mrs Seako, do you think their attitude has changed since?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1322"><a name="pos1322"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SEAKO:</span> Some of them according to my view have changed except the ones who are here, who are testifying here, I don't see any change.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1323"><a name="pos1323"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> Thank you Mrs Seako, is there anything finally that you would like to say to the Committee?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1324"><a name="pos1324"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SEAKO:</span> I would like to add that these men who are here they planned to bomb and whatever they are saying here it's not true.  The driver of the house was kicked out from the Shell House where he wanted to bomb and then he left there and he wasn't alone, there were two cars, one was escorting.  After you left the hotel you went to another car.  After you left the car with the bomb so there were two cars.  Shell House is the place where ANC people are.  You realised that you're failing to bomb Shell House and then you decided to bomb Bree Street and you've bombed or you had too many bombs in so many areas.  One lady came from Supreme Court and she told people that there was a bomb at Sanlam Building and this lady was looking for policemen to tell them.  Her name is Anna and Anna couldn't reach to any policemen but we showed her soldiers because we've already kicked policemen out of that area because we were suspecting that policemen were working with the AWB so that's why we kicked policemen.  We didn't want policemen to guard that area.  We realised that policemen themselves were stealing stocks from shops that's why I couldn't leave my shop, I was sleeping there.  I lost some of my stock and some was still there.   There were bombs in that area on that night.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1325"><a name="pos1325"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Ms Cambanis, how relevant is all this?  Is it relevant?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1326"><a name="pos1326"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> No, your worship, it's not.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1327"><a name="pos1327"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> I would like to ask one thing.  You're talking about the police.  You had a shop in Bree Street, were you there on that Sunday when the bomb exploded?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1328"><a name="pos1328"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SEAKO:</span> I came there.  My telephone numbers are kept by prostitutes, white prostitutes so whenever there's something near the shop they call me.  They called me on that specific day so I came down.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1329"><a name="pos1329"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> They called you?  When?  When exactly?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1330"><a name="pos1330"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SEAKO:</span> Immediately after the bomb exploded.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1331"><a name="pos1331"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> That's why I'm asking whether you were there when the bomb exploded?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1332"><a name="pos1332"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SEAKO:</span> No, I wasn't there, I was called.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1333"><a name="pos1333"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> When you arrived there what time was it?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1334"><a name="pos1334"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SEAKO:</span> We were not allowed to enter the place when I came there.  I went to Freda's shop first and I cleaned the place because Freda had died.  I cleaned her blood.  After I finished cleaning Freda's blood I went to my shop where I'm working, that's where I also discovered that Thokozile who was on her way to church.  Thokozile is my cousin, she was on her way to a Methodist Church.  She died on her way but when I arrived there she was no longer there, her body had been removed.  I went to the shop, I asked Yvonne the owner of the shop where the one that I was using and I also asked the prostitutes as to what happened so they explained to me.  I couldn't go back because my stock was already outside.  The shop had been damaged.  I slept there.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1335"><a name="pos1335"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> I would like to ask one thing here.  You also talked about Shell House, that they started at Shell House.  Where do you get this information?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1336"><a name="pos1336"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SEAKO:</span> One guy who was working at a hotel said so.  They came, these men came and asked the man what time do they open at the hotel.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1337"><a name="pos1337"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> And now you talked about street kids.  Where did you get this news as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1338"><a name="pos1338"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SEAKO:</span> These kids were sleeping outside the shop.  Two of them were working for a coloured lady, they were selling her stuff in corner Brooklyn and Bree.  These two kids were the ones who told the man who parked the car that his car was on fire and he answered them and said it wasn't it on fire but there was a bomb in that car.  When I arrived there they were there, they were injured, these boys.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1339"><a name="pos1339"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Did you talk to them?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1340"><a name="pos1340"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SEAKO:</span> Yes I did.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1341"><a name="pos1341"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Did they told you this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1342"><a name="pos1342"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SEAKO:</span> Yes they told me, they said the white man who parked the car was wearing a Russian uniform and they also told me that they've spoken to a guy who is working in a hotel, you can ask the guy as to what they've said to him.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1343"><a name="pos1343"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1344"><a name="pos1344"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Any other questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1345"><a name="pos1345"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> Thank you very much, none.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1346"><a name="pos1346"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS CAMBANIS</p>
<p class="line" id="line1347"><a name="pos1347"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Anybody else have questions?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1348"><a name="pos1348"></a><span class="speaker">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MS VAN DER WALT:</span> So therefore you say that these two children who gave you the version of what you have told us here that these persons were wearing Russian uniforms, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1349"><a name="pos1349"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SEAKO:</span> He was wearing a Russian hat, not uniform, not the full uniform.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1350"><a name="pos1350"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> But did these two street children that you have referred to tell you this?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1351"><a name="pos1351"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SEAKO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1352"><a name="pos1352"></a><span class="speaker">INTERPRETER:</span> Could the speaker please repeat what she said?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1353"><a name="pos1353"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> When did these two young boys pass away?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1354"><a name="pos1354"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SEAKO:</span> When they were in hospital.  I'm not talking about these other ones who were injured outside the shop, I'm talking about these two they died in hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1355"><a name="pos1355"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> But your evidence has been and I want to put it to you, Advocate Gcabashe did actually retrieve this from you, but I'm putting it to you that this is all based on hearsay and you told the Honourable Advocate that these two children who spoke to these people were the two that were injured, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1356"><a name="pos1356"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SEAKO:</span> Yes that is correct.  These two children who were selling at the corner are the ones who told me that a white man parked the car and they told the white man that your car was burning and he said that the car wasn't burning but there was a bomb in it.  Besides those two there were other two who were sleeping outside my shop.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1357"><a name="pos1357"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> And which ones passed away?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1358"><a name="pos1358"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SEAKO:</span> Four of them died.  When I arrived there two of them were injured and the other two had been taken to hospital.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1359"><a name="pos1359"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> There was no such evidence before the Supreme Court before Judge Flemming that street children had died or that had spoken to the people who had planted the bomb and who were told that the car was not on fire but that there was a bomb in the car.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1360"><a name="pos1360"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SEAKO:</span> That's why I find it very hard to forgive these men because the truth is not heard, not the whole truth has been heard about this matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1361"><a name="pos1361"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> Why didn't you make a statement to the police and tell the truth in that statement?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1362"><a name="pos1362"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SEAKO:</span> I personally, I don't have any trust on policemen.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1363"><a name="pos1363"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> No further questions thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1364"><a name="pos1364"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS VAN DER WALT</p>

<p class="line" id="line1366"><a name="pos1366"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Mrs Seako, may I just ask you, did you tell Ms Cambanis what you've told us now, earlier?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1367"><a name="pos1367"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SEAKO:</span> No I didn't tell her before, I only told her about Thokozile who is my cousin.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1368"><a name="pos1368"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> While you are talking her, in which way are you related?  How is she your cousin?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1369"><a name="pos1369"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SEAKO:</span> She's my cousin.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1370"><a name="pos1370"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Are your mothers sisters or are your fathers brothers or in which way is she your cousin?  How is she related to you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1371"><a name="pos1371"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SEAKO:</span> We are both Maduna.  Our last names are Maduna.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1372"><a name="pos1372"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Are her parents still alive?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1373"><a name="pos1373"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SEAKO:</span> Thokozile's mother died after the incident.  After we buried Thokozile, Thokozile's mother got ill and she died.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1374"><a name="pos1374"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And her father?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1375"><a name="pos1375"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SEAKO:</span> He died a long time ago.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1376"><a name="pos1376"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Was she married?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1377"><a name="pos1377"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SEAKO:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1378"><a name="pos1378"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Does she have children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1379"><a name="pos1379"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SEAKO:</span> Two.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1380"><a name="pos1380"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Can you help us with the addresses there.  Will you please just to one of our people give us the information as to exactly where her direct relatives could be traced.  But let me take you back to this other thing.  Why did you not tell your lawyer about the street children?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1381"><a name="pos1381"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SEAKO:</span> Like I said before that those were street kids and no one was taking care of them and no one actually came on their behalf even to the court, no one ever stood for them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1382"><a name="pos1382"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Why didn't you tell your lawyer that before today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1383"><a name="pos1383"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SEAKO:</span> I met this lawyer and I didn't have money, I didn't have money to pay for a lawyer, I don't even know even now who paid her.  So I didn't want to complicate my case, that's why I didn't say anything about the street kids.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1384"><a name="pos1384"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Did she not ask you about any - about your knowledge of this bombing, of this incident.  Were you not asked anything about your knowledge of the bombing?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1385"><a name="pos1385"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SEAKO:</span> She did ask me.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1386"><a name="pos1386"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> What did she ask you?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1387"><a name="pos1387"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SEAKO:</span> She asked me of the victims of Bree Street and if there were people that I know in Bree Street.  I only mentioned those who were alive and Thokozile was the only one who was late whom I've mentioned.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1388"><a name="pos1388"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> And the street kids, are they not late?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1389"><a name="pos1389"></a><span class="speaker">MRS SEAKO:</span> I didn't know who paid the lawyer and I didn't know if I was supposed to pay for the street kids as well so I was just representing Thokozile.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1390"><a name="pos1390"></a><span class="speaker">MR MALAN:</span> Thank you Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1391"><a name="pos1391"></a><span class="speaker">ADV BOSMAN:</span> Did you tell your lawyer about the fact that Ms Fani was married and that she has children?</p>

<p class="line" id="line1416"><a name="pos1416"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY ADV PRIOR:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1417"><a name="pos1417"></a>	Mrs Gumbi you are a victim of the bomb attack that occurred in Bree Street, Johannesburg, on the 24th April 1994, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1418"><a name="pos1418"></a><span class="speaker">MRS GUMBI:</span> Yes that is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1419"><a name="pos1419"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> At the time you were living in the vicinity of Bree Street.  Could you give the Committee the address where you were staying at that time?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1420"><a name="pos1420"></a><span class="speaker">MRS GUMBI:</span> I resided at Maxwell Hall, Flat No. 35, right next to the car where the bomb exploded.  There was store but today it's Joshua Doore furniture shop.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1421"><a name="pos1421"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> What floor were you on, your flat?  Was it the third floor?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1422"><a name="pos1422"></a><span class="speaker">MRS GUMBI:</span> Third floor yes, you're correct.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1423"><a name="pos1423"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> And was your flat facing the street, that is Bree Street?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1424"><a name="pos1424"></a><span class="speaker">MRS GUMBI:</span> It was facing the street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1425"><a name="pos1425"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Will you tell the Committee briefly about what happened during the morning of that day when the bomb exploded?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1426"><a name="pos1426"></a><span class="speaker">MRS GUMBI:</span> At the time we were preparing for the elections and that was exciting to us because it was the first time the blacks will be voting.  Myself and my son - when the bomb exploded I did not know as to what was happening.  My son by the name of Umfundo was in the living room and I was in the bathroom.  I got severely injured, my son as well.  He came to rescue me from the bathroom as I could not walk properly and he was injured as well.  Both doors - one could not open but they were blast open as a result of the bomb that exploded.  I had no clothes at all that I could wear and we had to leave the apartment.  It was dark, we left and we went outside.  I had a towel around me, in other words I wrapped a towel around me and I met others outside who were injured as well approaching from Small Street.  I was helped by people I did not know at all who enlisted some help to me and crossed the street and I met other women who gave me clothes to put on because I only had a towel around me.  I could not even think properly, my vision was failing me especially my right eye.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1427"><a name="pos1427"></a>	I was taken to the hospital and I did not get enough help.  When they dressed us, they dressed us on top of the wounds that already broken pieces of glasses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1428"><a name="pos1428"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Mrs Gumbi can you possibly tell the Committee the extent of your injuries and the injuries to your son?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1429"><a name="pos1429"></a><span class="speaker">MRS GUMBI:</span> I cannot use my right arm, this is far it can go up.  My eye as well, the vision is not clear.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1430"><a name="pos1430"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Your right - your arm, is it your left arm?  And was that cut, the glass or whatever penetrate your body?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1431"><a name="pos1431"></a><span class="speaker">MRS GUMBI:</span> It's my right arm - it's my left arm yes, it doesn't work properly and my left eye has well has been affected.  This is how I used to look.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1432"><a name="pos1432"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> You're referring to a photograph of you in the Star newspaper 25th April 1994 is that correct?  Mr Chairman, bundle A, page 16.  Under the title "Teacher grabs son and ran naked from her shattered flat" is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1433"><a name="pos1433"></a>	What injuries did your son have?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1434"><a name="pos1434"></a><span class="speaker">MRS GUMBI:</span> Umfundo was injured at the back and severely sore and they are still trying to extract the pieces of glass from his back and in 1994 it was not easy for him at school and 1995 had to repeat the same standard because the results were disastrous.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1435"><a name="pos1435"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Mrs Gumbi you have indicated that you have still problems with your eye and your arm, is that correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1436"><a name="pos1436"></a><span class="speaker">MRS GUMBI:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1437"><a name="pos1437"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Are you under any medical treatment or do you receive any medical treatment for that?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1438"><a name="pos1438"></a><span class="speaker">MRS GUMBI:</span> Yes I do but for the past three years I was not able - in other words I could not work.  I only started in 1997.  I was employed, I went to Saint Theresa at a Roman Catholic School, that's where I was working.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1439"><a name="pos1439"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Is it correct also that you have submitted a statement which has been referred to the Reparations Committee of the TRC, in other words your particulars have been obtained?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1440"><a name="pos1440"></a><span class="speaker">MRS GUMBI:</span> That is true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1441"><a name="pos1441"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Mrs Gumbi just a final aspect.  You've been present at the last set of hearings in June and you were here yesterday listening to the evidence.  What is your attitude regarding the amnesty applications of the various applicants?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1442"><a name="pos1442"></a><span class="speaker">MRS GUMBI:</span> I know my Government is sensitive, the Government is going to sympathise with them.  It is not within me to decide whether or not they will be granted amnesty but I know very well, they know themselves that today I'm a victim.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1443"><a name="pos1443"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Is that all you wish to say, Mrs Gumbi, about the applications?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1444"><a name="pos1444"></a><span class="speaker">MRS GUMBI:</span> Whatever they are saying they're telling a blatant lie, they are lying through their teeth.  There is nothing absolutely that they have said which is true.  I know they'll be granted amnesty but one thing I know for sure is that they are lying through their teeth.  That's a blatant lie, they refer this and that and that and you cannot find any correlation in their evidence and the prison is where they belong, must be their home.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1445"><a name="pos1445"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY ADV PRIOR</p>
<p class="line" id="line1446"><a name="pos1446"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are there any questions anybody?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1447"><a name="pos1447"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Mrs Gumbi I have a question for you.  Please explain to us that area, the vicinity of where you used to reside, was it an apartment flat type of residence or who were residing there?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1448"><a name="pos1448"></a><span class="speaker">MRS GUMBI:</span> Blacks were dominant in that area and it's quite a number of apartments in that area.  There is Bree Street - Bree Street alone there are apartments on the left side and on the right hand side starting from Eloff down and we were residing just a block away from Shell House.  I think they intended - the whole thing was designated for Shell House but we happened to be victims.  The impact of all this could have even touched the Shell House as well.  That's where the other car which was parked got effected.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1449"><a name="pos1449"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> On Sundays this place is quite busy?  Or how is this place especially on Sundays - is there any tranquillity at all or not?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1450"><a name="pos1450"></a><span class="speaker">MRS GUMBI:</span> No on Sunday it's quite calm, there is no traffic whatsoever, it's just quiet.  Everybody is at home, my son was at home as well.  Around ten on a Sunday, just imagine where could you wake up to be going to?  Fortunately I had not left for my shift at seven because if I had done that I would have died on the street.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1451"><a name="pos1451"></a><span class="speaker">ADV GCABASHE:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1452"><a name="pos1452"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mrs Gumbi, how do you feel about life in South Africa today?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1453"><a name="pos1453"></a><span class="speaker">MRS GUMBI:</span> Maybe I will put this badly, my lord, but I must say it - I must divulge and tell you whatever I feel.  Our Government of National Unity, the current Government, we are being taken as barbarians or people who are not at all literate.  As a teacher I will be teaching a white child and that white child would not be looking at you as a teacher, he will be looking at you as a maid and will even pose a question to you and say "are you really a teacher?" because all what we are known to be are thieves and domestic maids as well, our place is in the kitchen and they don't see us as blacks with proper state of mind.  It's not like we're in some kind of rivalry with them or competition with them, but that's how it's appearing that we're in competition, some kind of competition with them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1454"><a name="pos1454"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I've also been asked in the past whether I'm really a Judge.  Now how has this effected your life?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1455"><a name="pos1455"></a><span class="speaker">MRS GUMBI:</span> This coming Thursday, my advocate knows very well, I'll be teaching in another school.  I won't even hide that school - can I tell you, disclose the name of the school?  I was at Waverley Girls.  When they heard that I came and appeared, to this school, in June, they fired me and I know that is not proper in as far as labour law is concerned.  They spoke ill of me to other schools plus the former Roman School that I used to teach at.  Right now, I don't have any job, I'm not working but fortunately my God provided with me with some job but I'm afraid of telling them my former or my records because I'm afraid they will gather such information negative about me and fire me as well.  The state in which I am today is not appealing at all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1456"><a name="pos1456"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You seem to understand better than some others the processes with which we are busy with in this country, am I correct?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1457"><a name="pos1457"></a><span class="speaker">MRS GUMBI:</span> Yes that's very true.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1458"><a name="pos1458"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> And I can't ask you to forget but is it not possible with the passage of time for you to forgive?  I don't know if you can answer it today.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1459"><a name="pos1459"></a><span class="speaker">MRS GUMBI:</span> That's a very difficult question because when I recall the very first time we had this hearing on the 17th you were here and there was one who shot at our people in Pretoria, innocently, innocent people and Mandela forgave him with all his heart.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1460"><a name="pos1460"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I quite understand that.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1461"><a name="pos1461"></a><span class="speaker">MRS GUMBI:</span> He displayed a state of being unsatisfied but us who were victims we did nothing to them, we just looked at them.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1462"><a name="pos1462"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I can only hope that with time that that type of attitude towards our people will cease and that during that same period that we can go towards living with each other irrespective of the colour of our skin and I hope with time you are able to come to terms with your unfortunate experience.  I thank you for coming to give evidence.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1463"><a name="pos1463"></a><span class="speaker">MRS GUMBI:</span> Thank you.  I'm sorry to waste your time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1464"><a name="pos1464"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> You're not wasting my time.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1465"><a name="pos1465"></a><span class="speaker">MRS GUMBI:</span> Okay fine.  During that time when I was injured I was able to write three books that will be published.  It's a pity because some of them are in Zulu.  When I no problem to translate those books in English but I do have and I had even the latest poem that I have written in Zulu as well, a very painful one that goes "A person is a book that you cannot read" referring to the people who still continue fighting with us because you cannot summarise a person and think his abilities are up to this extent.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1466"><a name="pos1466"></a>WITNESS EXCUSED</p>
<p class="line" id="line1467"><a name="pos1467"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Prior, have you got any other witnesses?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1468"><a name="pos1468"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> I have no other witnesses.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1469"><a name="pos1469"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Yes Ms Cambanis?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1470"><a name="pos1470"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> Thank you Mr Chair.  I call Joan Keane who shall be accompanied by her husband.  They both - they each have a short statement they wish to submit.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1471"><a name="pos1471"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mrs Keane which language would you prefer to use?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1472"><a name="pos1472"></a><span class="speaker">JOAN KEANE:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1473"><a name="pos1473"></a><span class="speaker">EXAMINATION BY MS CAMBANIS:</span> Mrs Keane is it correct that your details have been submitted by myself to the TRC regarding the address and your whereabout for the purposes of reparation?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1474"><a name="pos1474"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KEANE:</span> Do I have to give my address in public?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1475"><a name="pos1475"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> No, I have already - it's been given.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1476"><a name="pos1476"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KEANE:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1477"><a name="pos1477"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I think it will be better, you will pick up what she says if you put the headphones on.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1478"><a name="pos1478"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> Now Mrs Keane, you have a statement you wish to read, this is in regard to your daughter Susan who was killed in a car in the Bree Street incident.  Would you please continue?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1479"><a name="pos1479"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KEANE:</span> Mr Chair, as a mother and victim and having considered all the facts, I consider it is only God that can forgive these people for their cowardly acts of terrorism and treason.  By their own admission they were prepared to put this country to flames with callous disregard for human life.  On the 24th April 1994 in Bree Street they murdered our only child, Susan Ann Keane who was in the prime of her life and had made the most of the privileges this country had given her which unfortunately so obviously others had wasted.  She had a B.Soc. Science degree, a higher diploma in Third World Development and Planning and a masters degree in Town Planning.  She had so much to offer her beloved South Africa.  Susan worked tirelessly in pursuit of justice and democracy for all and extended her hand of friendship to everyone regardless of race or religion.  Her warmth and kindness touched many lives.  We thank God for giving us such a wonderful and caring daughter and we return her to Him with love.  May she rest in peace knowing that she has made her contribution to the land God gave all South Africans to cherish and preserve.  Our deepest regret is that we never had time to say goodbye.  Although we tried to help others in Susan's memory, our lives have deteriorated to a mere existence and now in our retirement years we have to face a future of loneliness without her to comfort or care for us.  The atrocities they committed have caused untold misery and tragedy for the families who lost their loved ones and who are not able to be here to speak for themselves.  Their breadwinners, the children and for those who are maimed and injured, you had no right in the name of God to decide whose lives were expendable.  We actually pity you for having to beg for amnesty and live the rest of your lives with these deplorable deeds on your conscience as at the end, you will have to meet your Maker whose commandment was thou shalt not kill.  As self professed christians and adults, the final decision was yours and you chose to commit a barbaric criminal act, the murder of one human being by another.  Your attempts to equate your heinous act with other political acts is preposterous.  You had freedom and the vote which these people were denied during the 40 years of apartheid rule.  You knew you were free to negotiate right up to the last moment.  At this point I would like to say to you and I will look at you while I say this - love your children with all your heart and all your soul because God forbid they would be taken from you by murderers like yourselves.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1480"><a name="pos1480"></a>	Finally, if you were sincere in offering your sympathy, this Commission would not have had to ask if you were remorseful.  You were unmoved, you would have offered it of your own free will long before now.  God bless all the victims and comfort them.  God bless the new South Africa and it's leaders.  Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1481"><a name="pos1481"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> Mrs Keane, I would just like you to inform the Honourable Chairperson, you attended the criminal proceedings at which the applicants appeared and an incident took place regarding an apology.  If you could just please enlighten the Chairperson about the circumstances that happened at the criminal court?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1482"><a name="pos1482"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KEANE:</span> A member of the press approached me and said - some lady, I don't know who she was - had offered her apologies and I said does that include the blacks?  She went away and came back and said no.  I said then I don't accept her apology.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1483"><a name="pos1483"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> ...[inaudible] Mrs Keane?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1484"><a name="pos1484"></a><span class="speaker">MRS KEANE:</span> No, but I think my husband would like some statement, thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1485"><a name="pos1485"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> Thank you.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1486"><a name="pos1486"></a>NO FURTHER QUESTIONS BY MS CAMBANIS</p>

<p class="line" id="line1488"><a name="pos1488"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEANE:</span> Mr Chair, I have followed the trial I fail to understand why Koekemoer has not been summonsed to appear before this Commission?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1489"><a name="pos1489"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> Sorry Mr Keane?  He hasn't been sworn in Chairperson.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1490"><a name="pos1490"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Is he going to give evidence?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1491"><a name="pos1491"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> He has a statement that he wishes to submit to this Committee.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1492"><a name="pos1492"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Are you Mr Keane?  Is this Mr Keane?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1493"><a name="pos1493"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> Mr Keane, yes Mr Chair.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1494"><a name="pos1494"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Mr Keane do you prefer to use the English language as well?</p>
<p class="line" id="line1495"><a name="pos1495"></a><span class="speaker">MR KEANE:</span> English, yes.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1496"><a name="pos1496"></a><span class="speaker">JOHN KEANE:</span> (sworn states)</p>
<p class="line" id="line1497"><a name="pos1497"></a>	I will begin again.  I have followed the trial and the proceedings and fail to understand why Koekemoer has not been summonsed to appear before this Commission.  Apparently he has not been granted indemnity from prosecution, nor has he applied for amnesty.  I consider the Commission had a mandate to extract the whole truth and will fail in it's duty if he is not called.  I'm not entirely satisfied with the investigation and totally disillusioned that they failed to uplift Koekemoer's report back file which seems to me to be of the utmost importance and highly relevant to these proceedings.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1498"><a name="pos1498"></a>	Furthermore, they failed to point out that there were two policemen present who co-operated with the accused.  With regard to the Bree Street bomb, police complicity was apparent to many witnesses and having been informed that the car contained a bomb they failed in their duty to issue a warning while smoke was pouring from the car.  According to three newspaper reports, the police stopped a car with three blacks in it and spread-eagled them on the road and released them moments before the bomb exploded.  And something else I fail to see is why they placed the bomb in Bree Street, it didn't seem to come out in the evidence.  Why they selected that spot</p>
<p class="line" id="line1499"><a name="pos1499"></a>or why they put it there at all, there didn't seem to be any reason for it.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1500"><a name="pos1500"></a>	Our loss has been so great that we will never in our few remaining years be able to come to terms with my daughter's murder.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1501"><a name="pos1501"></a><span class="speaker">MS CAMBANIS:</span> Thank you very much Mr Keane.  Thank you Mr Chair.</p>

<p class="line" id="line1510"><a name="pos1510"></a><span class="speaker">MS VAN DER WALT:</span> There was a document which I forgot to hand in, I don't have copies for the other members of the panel but it is Mr Abie Fourie, Abraham Christoffel Fourie's affidavit which is aimed at rectifying his sentence of guilt.  If you will remember, Chairperson, he was under the impression that he was found guilty on all charges whilst he was actually only found guilty on the charges of the pipe bomb.  I thought that this should be placed in an affidavit form in order to place it on record correctly.  As it pleases you chair.  At a later stage it was put to him that he was found guilty only with regard to the pipe bombs.  I would appreciate if I would be allowed to submit this along with copies as an exhibit and that is all which I have left.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1511"><a name="pos1511"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> ...[inaudible] the Committee to an affidavit of Theunis Louis Pretorius which regards the Koekemoer matter and I think the affidavit is self-explanatory and possibly, I don't know if the Committee wishes to hear me on why Koekemoer wasn't called?  I could briefly, possibly in a few...</p>
<p class="line" id="line1512"><a name="pos1512"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Please.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1513"><a name="pos1513"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Mr Chairman, as evidence leader, the situation was assessed and Koekemoer who, it was common cause at the trial, was a police informer and common cause that he built or assisted in building the bombs that went off in the various places.  It was on record - he had not applied for amnesty, he was informed, as I understand, as an implicated person.  He chose not to appear at these proceedings.  The question of him or his activities in so far as his information to the police is concerned was raised by the applicants.  In as much as Koekemoer's activities with the police was unknown to the applicants, it could not have effected the facts upon which the applications are based.  The fact that Koekemoer may have been in complicity with the police or the police in complicity with Koekemoer would not have taken the applications any further.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1514"><a name="pos1514"></a>	Furthermore, I understood from the witness protection department of the TRC, Advocate McAdam, that Koekemoer had been relocated in terms of a justice witness programme, he received a new identity and there was also a very strong possibility that he was either assisting the Attorney General in other prosecutions and for that reason the Attorney General was not prepared in terms of Section, I think, 31 of the Act to allow or permit Koekemoer to give evidence, in other words to his prejudice.  That situation being the case, the likelihood that Koekemoer's legal representative would have then consented to him to have given evidence was regarded and viewed as being remote and all those facts taken together, I was satisfied that the matter not be pursued and for that reason Koekemoer - I did not insist that Koekemoer be brought.  I'm also - there's obviously Koekemoer ....[intervention]</p>
<p class="line" id="line1515"><a name="pos1515"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> I don't think even if you insisted you could have succeeded.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1516"><a name="pos1516"></a><span class="speaker">ADV PRIOR:</span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Chairman, obviously the intrigues behind and whoever was handling him is contained in the affidavit of Superintendent Pretorius and in particular paragraph 8, he indicates that the police were unaware that he in fact was manufacturing the bombs.  This only came out after his arrest.  Thank you Mr Chairman.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1517"><a name="pos1517"></a><span class="speaker">CHAIRPERSON:</span> Well that seems to be the end of the evidence.  The issue of making a decision falls into our lap.  It is customary for us to be favoured with argument by representatives before we do so.  It seems appropriate in this matter to allow the legal representatives, because it has been a longish hearing, until next Wednesday - what will be the date?  23rd of this month, September, to submit any heads of argument if they wish to do so to our head office in Cape Town.  In dealing with the issues the panel is particularly interested in the following and we ask all parties who choose to submit heads to deal with it</p>
<p class="line" id="line1518"><a name="pos1518"></a>	  To whatever extent the question of racism is relevant, whether the policy of the AWB was objectively racist or subjectively racist and how we should approach the matter.   To whatever extent the question of racism is relevant - whether the policy of the AWB was objectively racist or subjectively racist and how should we approach the matter.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1519"><a name="pos1519"></a>	Secondly whether whatever was committed was committed by a splinter group or whether it was committed by the AWB through it's various military organs.  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1520"><a name="pos1520"></a>	In each of the two issues, we would like the matter to be dealt with applicant by applicant.  If in the event of us finding that it was a racist activity, how would that fact impact of the applications in itself?  </p>
<p class="line" id="line1521"><a name="pos1521"></a>	Next - whether generally the applications complied with the act.  We wish you also to deal with the matter of credibility of each applicant and witness for the purpose of this application I don't think we include victims.  We don't need the victims evidence to be dealt with.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1522"><a name="pos1522"></a>	And lastly, we wish you to deal - no not lastly - the aspect of proportionality, that is a factor that is included in the Act and lastly, to what extent the rank of each of the applicants is relevant.  That's all.</p>
<p class="line" id="line1523"><a name="pos1523"></a>	Before I close this hearing, I wish to express our gratitude to all those who arranged for this hearing and all that goes with arranging the hearing, for the work of the security officials and also the interpreters.  I know the last two days they've input and stretched, I thank them for their work.  I thank also all the representatives for the patience and the way they conducted the hearing and in particular I wish to thank those victims or suffered or sustained injuries or suffered the loss of family members.  It must be an extremely difficult time to have to experience those events all over again and I am not in a position from where I sit to comfort you, neither am I in a position to say to you forgive and forget but within the context of this whole process and I think I speak on behalf of the Commission, one can only hope that the hurt and the emotional distress that you as victims experience will diminish with time and that one can only hope also that you come to terms with life in South Africa despite those grave losses.  Having said that I close the hearing.</p>
