But someone else said we cannot withdraw the nation and so the rumours spread through the children of Israel which said the country which we withdrew from, and the people we saw there, are great.  We saw giants there.  Children of the giant.\n\tVerse 30, let us withdraw and take occupation later, because we can surely overcome them.  It is wonderful for me that the media can have such an effect on people.  That is what the anti-Christian powers want, they want to influence the beliefs of the masses if we look at the press, the radio and the television, which has infiltrated our homes, and the masses have simply taken them up.\n\tMy fellow people, our security does not lay in what the world promises our people, because your and my security lies in the safety of God, of Jesus Christ who died on the cross for us.\n\tWe will not be those \"bywoners\" in South Africa, we will not be influenced by communism.  We do not have to make any apologies for our presence as white Boer Christians here in this southern tip of Africa.\n\tGod's hand of provision has brought us thus far.  God has given this country to our people by means of two covenants.  God's Word says today that the Lord your God, gave the country to you to earn as your parents and your parents before them, have told you.\n\tThe question is, are we prepared for this or are we getting cold feet?  The people must remember the promise that we will occupy the land.  The moment of glory has come.  We have been chosen to go and investigate the country and to report back.   We have investigated the country, it is a great country with rich cities and its occupants are giants, its cities are fortified.  We look like dwarfs in comparison.\n\tWe cannot occupy this land.  We do not have the proper weapons with which to arm our people.  It is very dangerous and we are walking into trouble with open eyes.  We will be destroyed.\n\tLet us turn around, we cannot risk it.  Then Joshua reported and said the country which we have investigated is a good and fruitful land, the milk and honey overflows.  Let us withdraw and then occupy, because we can certainly overwhelm it.  That which the Lord will give to us, is good.\n\tBut as usual, the report of the majority was accepted, and what a sad story.  A tragic story of a nation who had thrown ... (tape ends) ... Piet Retief, that the country had been explored.\n\tI want to ask you this, how are you and I in our attitudes, by means of our God given rights to this land?  How do we feel about our call as Afrikaners in this country as those who were chosen to take up this legacy given by God our Father?\n\tHow do we stand towards this country which was given to our people by God.   God's country is there, we must just occupy it, God gave us this country.  We cannot negotiate about this land.\n\tI wonder if our people realise the seriousness of this choice.  People who have the enormous responsibility of preserving God's property, that is our responsibility.  That is the responsibility of the Boer volk, to reserve, preserve and develop this country which was given to us by God.\n\tOur people have been misled, thousands have died.  That is our exact problem, everything is at our disposal.  The riches and the words of God which are full of promise, this country with its possibilities which God gave to the people by means of a vow, what are we doing with it?\t\n\tDo we take it up for ourselves or are we ruining our chances?  That is what Israel did.  They created a land of opportunity, but they lost it because they did not have faith.  Because they did not have faith, because they stood away, stood back from the cities and the giants, because they would rather chose the little that they had.\n\tBecause they stood in opposition to these powers, but thank the Lord, that Joshua and his partners, did not agree with this view.  They saw the Hand of God which would lead them into this country.  It is the Hand of God which made the promise that you will occupy this country.  You and I must remember that we got this country by means of the vow.\n\tThis is the country which our predecessors, our descendants left for us.  We must not fight and argue.  There are many women and children in this country, which was dipped in the blood of war.\n\tI want to say to you this morning that God has given us this country already.  You and I must occupy and conserve that which God has given us, even though the world says whatever it says.  We must remain thankful that I should never have to report to Mandela or De Klerk.  You and I will answer to God and we must answer to the question what did you do to the property that I gave you?\n\tWhat did you go with this country that I entrusted to you?  Did you cultivate it, did you create a legacy out of it for your descendants?  We must tell God today that we will fight for that which is ours.\n\tLet us fight then.  Let us fight for this country which God has given us and let us fight on the same side.  Let us take each other's hands.  Let us walk the path of faith.  Let our story never be the same as that of Israel.",

            "When we came to the Fatherland, we came to listen and talk and make a joint decision because Paul Kruger said that in the voice of my volk, I hear the voice of my God.  That is why it is important for us to participate in today's proceedings.  The volk must talk, because therein lies the task of our volk.\n\tThe volk is a faithful volk, which has committed itself to make this country wealthy through cultivation.  We have committed ourselves to this country in God's name and to give it down to our descendants. \n\tThe honour and the wealth of victory will always depend on God.  A house will be built in your name and we will tell our children to the furthest generations, that this is what our volk did.  We have always used you in the meetings of our volk, especially with regards to the annexation of Transvaal when the Boers felt the humiliation of the loss of their sovereignty, the volk gathered at Paardekraal and said what can we do?\n\tThe volk packed the stones and spoke to God.  That is when the volk decided that we cannot live in subjection, the volk was not prepared to give in and from there, the first freedom war emanated and twice thereafter the Boers stormed up Majuba mountain and took back the freedom of the volk, which was from the most powerful empire at that time, the British Empire.\n\tThose who determine the direction, those who are the natural leaders only 5 000 people from the Boer republic, went up Majuba mountain and took part in a battle which was the same as that of Blood River.\n\tMilitarily speaking we had the best base.  Earlier during the parade it was asked whether or not 80 percent of us sitting here, were in Bophuthatswana.  You know that when you were welcomed and blankets were given to you, this was after Rowan Cronje and I had an agreement with Bophuthatswana and the former Rhodesia that the AWB's presence would be felt there.\t\n\tIn an operation area while the Bophuthatswana Defence Force was in mutiny, while the Police were all in mutiny, Viljoen's Officer was sent to the AWB in spite of our agreements and he said the AWB must get out.  They are enough to handle the situation.\n\tWhen his body was ripped of the vehicle and the vehicle was shot down, and the convoy was stopped, all six wounded were taken up and taken to a place of safety and this was executed within a barrage of automatic gunfire and the blacks retreated despite the fact that our bullets could not penetrate their armoury.\n\tThe fire of the Boers who shot through the tiny hole which they could see, and that is how we saved the day.  Our casualties the following morning, was zero.  Not one single AWB member had died, five were wounded and on the other side, according to the SABC, 50 had died and 285 had been wounded.\n\tApparently they are still running.  I know of no military set-up and I am a militarist, I did patrol work for a long time, I was on the border of South West Africa where I fought for a year and 14 days.  I am a militarist, it is my interest and I know of no other battle in which ordinary vehicles with handguns and shotgun fire, fought against military vehicles and ammunition, which left no single Boer casualty during that incident.\n\tRegarding our friends who were taken out of the convoy, they were occupied by the Bophuthatswana government and shot dead.  There they were murdered in cold blood by the State.  This Honourable Chairperson General, the blood which flowed there, is blood which heralded the beginning of the freedom struggle with the participation of thousands of men and women and children.\n\tWe must now allow that our volk feels alone.  We must support our volk with sincere prayer so that the Comforter of grief and tears can be felt.\n\tI feel very proud as a leader in front of proud soldiers, men of courage and determination.  There was never any retreat, cowardice or lack of order.  There was always discipline.  I must tell you that I thought many times that I should also have left, but I did not because if I had turned around, there would have been people who said turn around and shoot, because some of our people might have died in that event.  That is why I thank my Corporals.  They led a convoy out of an ambush, which deserves the admiration of the world.\n\tI thank my staff, thank you very much.  When I listened to Mr Willem Olivier - indeed we are threatened and people are fighting against us, the powers of Hell are fighting against us.  We must remember that our Christian Creator would never expect anything from us which we cannot manage.  He would never expect of us to become a Jodi Scheckter all of a sudden and becomes the world's best driving champion.\n\tHe wouldn't expect of us to climb into the boxing ring tomorrow.  He would never give you a task which you cannot handle.  He would only show you what to do if it is possible for you to do it.  If you think about the handful of Voortrekkers in the ox wagon who braved the fever and the illness alone, the illness which killed them, if we think about that, it would never have occurred to us that the Boer could win at Majuba and they did, despite all of this they did.\n\tIf we think about the Battle of Blood River where we faced an enemy of 30 000, and even then we became famous in battles of the world which we won.  We were made strong by our God.  When it came to fighting against the Zulu's and the Xhosa's, we had to fight against obstacles, we still fight against obstacles such as communism.\n\tThese are our political enemies.  We must fight against the bombardment of communism from the Eastern countries.  We must sound the trumpet of the volk and announce that we are here today, we must say the country is good, let's take it.\n\tWe will look like locusts in comparison to our enemies, because they are giants, but this view is not entirely of application, because the group which is threatening us is not a group of giants, and we are not like locusts.\n\tThat is why I say that by means of our experiences and our intellectual abilities and our spirit and the spirit of God which runs through your veins, you can never see yourself as a locus then, because of that.  We are the giants then, we are the white giants.\n\tWe were mentioning figures during the last couple of meetings and we have seen that there are thousands of Permanent Defence Force members.  There are 250 000 Commando and active Civil members of which 180 000 at least are right-wingers.  The South African Police of which 80 percent are right-wingers, and if you add on the 180 000 of the Defence Force Commando members who are right-wingers to the South African Police, and the 65 000 AWB members, then we are more than prepared.\n\tWe have the minority of whites, but we have the majority of soldiers among us.  Umkhonto weSizwe which has 28 million people under its representation, only has about 7 000 members, not 15 000 members.\n\tWe have come out of the heart of the volk for the AWB.  Not only are we the right-wingers, but we have suffered humiliation, fraud and other hardships, but we have become the strongest right wing organisation in this country.\n\tI challenge you then as Officers and as believers that I have stood before audiences and called and begged and scolded until I have gathered 60 000 of you together.  Now fetch them and arrange them in your Commando's because there are very few choices.\n\tNext month this time, we will have become part of a new State and those three sixes will hover above our fatherland in the air, or will we have our Volkstaat, no matter how big or how small.  We want our own piece of land in which we can protect our 60 000 men, women and children.  These are our options.\n\tI have told you that I will never accept an ANC government.  Since then I have never changed my mind, and therefore I cannot say anything else.  I must say it once more.\n\tI am what you have made of me.  My task is fulfilled in the obtaining of the Volkstaat.  I just want to tell Viljoen and some of the others, that I refuse to place my Generals in command of people whom we cannot trust.\n\tWith the greatest possible level of co-operation and the Boere Krisis Aksie, the greatest level of co-operation with all our friends, and with the men and women and children who are prepared to take the oath of loyalty.  You will see that there are more than 60 000 of them.\n\tThere will be a time when we fill find our final resting place and that will be when we ultimately obtain a much bigger Volkstaat than what Mandela had ever planned for us.  I promise you that when we have won the war, Mandela will ask us for land and then we will decide whether or not we could do away with a centimetre or two.",
