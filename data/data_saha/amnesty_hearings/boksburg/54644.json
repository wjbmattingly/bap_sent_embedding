            "Pages 339 - 341.  And then I would like to make a submission, yes, I would like to make a submission in relation to Paragraph 6.1.3, and to submit that although we have taken the list and the knowledge of Mr and Mrs Derby-Lewis for it's purpose and dealt with it separately with the knowledge of the purpose for which the gun was to be used on both Mr Derby-Lewis' and Mrs Derby-Lewis' knowledge, what we would submit is that, if the Committee accepts that the list what was for the purposes of elimination then it becomes highly improbable that the showing of the gun was merely of the, for the purposes of showing that a start had been made in the accumulation of stock piling of guns for the future.\n\tWhat we submit is that these two should be taken together and evidence of the intention to use the list for the purposes of assassination is in fact strong evidence that the use of the gun was not for the supposedly lawful purpose of self defence in the future.  Mr Chairman I do not intend, with respect, reading out the passages.  They are there for the Committee's consideration and I do not want to burden the record, or to take up time unnecessarily.  \n\tI want to go to 6.2 on Page 11 where we submit that the Applicants' lied about the purpose of obtaining the firearm and the silencer and again we submit that they should be taken together with the list.  And 6.2.4 that we draw particular attention to the statement of Mr Derby-Lewis, the reference to which is given in 6.2.4.1 and we would refer to the fact that there it is stated that the question of procuring the gun was before February 1993, Mr Chairman.\n\tThen, I would like to go to Page 14 and this is the Applicants have lied about the scope of the conspiracy as to the number of people who were to be arrested.  I have already dealt with that in general terms and, but here are the references which are both to the Record and to their statements and we set out verbatim answers given to members of the Committee which clearly show what we submitted yesterday that their answers are so inherently improbable that their evidence should be rejected and that what is contained in their statements is true and what the overwhelming probabilities indicate that this was a murder list.\n\tThe untruthfulness of Mrs Derby-Lewis in the criminal court of course are of vital importance in relation to her credibility and on Page 18 we submit that the Applicants have lied about when the conspiracy to murder ANC SACP leaders was entered into and we submit in 6.4.1 on Page 18 that although Chris Hani was decided upon in February  1993 as the first target, the discussion as to what action should be taken started immediately after the referendum in March 1992 and intensified by the latter part of 1992 and we rely on that on the evidence of Mr Derby-Lewis which we give the reference to.\n\tThe names other than those identified as Revolutionaries were added to the list, to the hit list in order to cause confusion which may also be an excuse invented at the time of the criminal trial and we refer to the R4 statements in support of that submission.  Walus' statement that after the unbanning of the ANC, PAC and SACP in February 1992 when he became very concerned about the situation in the country, \"especially during the second part of 1992 when Clive and I discussed the worsening of the security situation and the high level of unrest which deteriorated day by day.  More and more policemen got shot on duty.  \n\tThat was unacceptable for us and Clive and I started to discuss in the direction of eliminating selective members of the ANC, PAC Alliance.  Clive asked if I was prepared to eliminate political opponents and I agreed to do so.  Towards the end of February 1993 during the visit to Clive at his home, he showed me a list with nine names.  We discussed the names on the list and I numbered them according to priority of elimination\", accords with the probabilities and should be accepted without reservation and we submit that that is quite inconsistent with the denial.",

            "That's really the ...[inaudible].  for that correction.  It was too broadly, a little too broadly stated in the statement but the validity of the statement that they were lying as to when the conspiracy was hatched is submitted on their statements and in the Record Mr Chairman.  The coincidence of what is contained in the statements and how much of it is in accordance with their evidence is of course an important factor as to whether the statements were taken freely and voluntarily or not.\n\tAnd then we say in 6.4.4., Walus admitted in his evidence that he had once driven past Mr Mandela's house during the summer of '92/'93.  Walus is deliberately evasive about exactly when he drove past Mr Mandela's house, after he admitted that he usually drove his brother's white bakkie which his brother had in 1991 and 1992.\n\tHe further tries to confuse the date by making reference to having known where Mr Mandela's house is by using the list of nine names as a source.  We submit that the Committee should accept the evidence of Mrs Beyers, that she saw Mr Walus watching the house of Mr Mandela in July 1992.  Mrs Beyers gave forthright evidence and had the opportunity to observe Walus when both their cars stopped next to each other at the traffic light.\n\tShe was a credible witness and the Committee should accept her reasons for not having come forward soon after seeing Mr Walus' picture in the newspapers in April 1993.  It is submitted that it would have been, could not have been necessary for her to come forward at the time as Mr Walus had already been arrested.  It is submitted that the Committee should find that the conspiracy to eliminate leaders of the ANC, SACP was entered into at least during the latter part of 1992 and not in February 1993.\n\tA point was made by Counsel for the Applicants that identification is a fallible process.  We agree with that but there are difficulties in the submission when you are asked to reject Mrs Beyers as evidence because here we have a person who admits that he drove a white bakkie at that time although he says that it didn't have bullet holes on it.  Well, he may be telling the truth about that or may not, or it may be that I'm told, that sometimes there are stickers with, resembling bullet holes on cars, it may be that there was one of them but be that as it may, he admits that at or about that time he had the use of such a motor car.\n\tHe admits that although a little later he did go to observe Mr Mandela's house, he is obviously being untruthful as to what the purpose was.  He says that he was selling crystal glass from his father's factory which had gone bankrupt a number of years before in Houghton and he happened to be passing by.  Challenged to point one shopkeeper or one resident to whom he sold the piece of glass, he was unable to tell us.  \n\tIf I remember correctly he said that he hadn't succeeded in selling anything to anybody in Houghton in order to justify the -.  Now why he should be in Houghton and by chance pass Mr Mandela's house which one can almost take cognisance of is on a, in a quiet suburb, a T intersection, off the corner at the time and why he should be seen there is inexplicable.  And this of course is further evidence that they were not truthful and forthcoming as to when the conspiracy was hatched, who were the victims to be and on that basis and the others we submit that amnesty should be refused.",

They have not disclosed the names of other people in the CP who discussed and decided with them that violence had become an option for the CP.\n\tChairperson, in the evidence of Mr Derby-Lewis himself, he states that many discussions were held by people on the right concerning actions to stop the Nationalist political cause and he further states that actions were being planned and put into operation and that evidence is to be found in FR Page 109.\n\tChairperson, the Applicants are expected to disclose all the people who were party to these discussions which we shall presume lead to their final decision that Chris Hani should be assassinated.  That actions were being planned and put into operation is also stated in bundle A and their references in paragraph 6.5.1.

That they were involved in negotiations at the time.\n\tAt Page 26 Chairperson, 7.5, Dr Hartzenberg was giving this interview on the 20th April 1993, the day after Chris Hani had been, the day after the funeral and he said that the CP was still involved in negotiations, the multi party conference negotiations which were being held and reference is at the paragraph itself.\n\tChairperson at Page 36 which is acting in the course and scope of duties and within the scope or express or implied authority, Chairperson if our submission is correct that the Applicants did not act on behalf of the CP, then this submission becomes superfluous but in their Heads they do contend that they were acting within the course and scope of their duties and Mr Bizos has already made a submission that in order for the Applicants to rely on course and scope they should be able to state what duties, what tasks had been given to them by the CP within which they claim to have assassinated Chris Hani.\n\tAnd it is our submission therefore that in as far as they tried to rely on this paragraph, they cannot succeed because they have failed to specify their duties within which they were acting.  In fact the CP has discounted having ever planned, commanded or ordered any of the activities in relation to violence and specifically in relation to the assassination of political leaders.

            "Chairperson, under Paragraph 11, Mr Walus contends that he was acting under orders and my learned friend Mr Bizos has already made submissions that Mr Walus essentially changed the manner in which he is going to conduct his evidence in his Application for Amnesty after he had seen the Max Du Preez TRC Special Report and decided that he would now consistently claim that he was acting under orders.\n\tChairperson at 11.1, if I may read this section out.  In his Application Mr Walus initially stated that,\n\"The Applicant acted alone in the planning and the commission of this deed.\"\n.2, when Walus made this statement he was fully aware of the facts surrounding the assassination of Chris Hani.  He was trying to minimise the role played by Derby-Lewis, also evidenced in Derby-Lewis' Application and his evidence on Record.  His preparedness to protect Mr Derby-Lewis is also recorded in R4, Page 306.\n\tHis answer under this paragraph was subsequently changed on 13 November 1996 to read as follows,\n\"In pursuance of the instructions of Clive John Derby-Lewis, a senior member of the Conservative Party, prior to 6 April 1993 we, Clive John Derby-Lewis and I jointly planned to assassinate Chris Hani.  On 6 April 1993 Clive John Derby-Lewis handed me an unlicensed firearm for the purpose of assassinating Chris Hani.\"\nChairperson, at 11.4, we make the submission that by the above statement Walus is trying to marry the suggestion that he was acting under instructions and that they acted jointly.  There obviously is a contradiction in these statements, especially in view of the fact that Derby-Lewis in his  amended response to Paragraph 9(a)(i) does not mention having given instructions to Walus.\n\tAnd Chairperson, in November both of them had access to legal representation and therefore if one looks at the body of the Application of Mr Derby-Lewis one will observe that even after the lawyers had come in to assist him, he consistently indicated in his Application that he was a co-conspirator, he was an equal to Clive Derby-Lewis and not a foot soldier acting under orders.\n\tAnd that submission is made at 11.5.  The Applicant was moved by his personal understanding of what was happening in the country and he \"vowed to do something to try and stop the handover to communist rule\", and there's a reference.  Under paragraph 10(b) of his Application, Walus clearly shows an understanding of the political developments in the country and clearly identifies himself with the political objective of the CP or that of Derby-Lewis, to hold the coming to power of the communists.\n\tThe reading of Paragraph 11(a) of his Application clearly shows an understanding of Conservative Party politics and his association therewith.  In his evidence he did not try to limit his knowledge of the Conservative Party politics but confirmed such understanding.  His understanding of these politics and the objectives of the CP are those of Mr Derby-Lewis is not that of a person whose interest is only to carry out orders or instructions of the leadership.\n\tMr Walus told the investigation officer that he and Clive planned the murder together.  To a question by Judge Ngoepe, Walus conceded or agreed that he participated in the killing of Hani because he was driven by his immense hatred of the communist regime and his previous terrible experiences under communism in Poland.\n\tAfter it had been put to Walus that he was tailoring his evidence to accord with that, that submission has already been made Chairperson.  At 11.12, when the evidence of Mr Derby-Lewis was read to Walus and there's a reference, he admitted the following:\n\"That he and Derby-Lewis were discussing as friends, they were discussing as like-minded persons in terms of politics that in February 1993 they jointly agreed on the assassination.  That they talked as colleagues, and as co-supporters in every aspect.  That they were talking privately between the two of them, that he, Walus volunteered to execute their joint decision.  That he, Walus was not under any pressure to do that and that Derby-Lewis had no control over him in terms of the execution.\"\n\tAnd at this point Chairperson, the evidence is that Mr Walus was alone when he executed this act and if he was under any compulsion it did not apply for a very long period he was conducting reconnaisances by himself.  Derby-Lewis was not standing by to see that he does execute his orders and therefore his claim that he was acting under orders should not be accepted.  He could have withdrawn from this plot at any stage.  He was not under pressure from Mr Derby-Lewis nor from the CP.\n\tIt is submitted that Walus' evidence at Page 899, 904 and 914 of the First Record that he acted under instructions is contradictory to that of Mr Derby-Lewis and to what he says in his own Application and has testified to at Pages 71 to 78 of the Second Record.\n\tMr Walus disputes that he could have quoted Langenhoven during the interrogation but what he admits in his evidence or what he states in his evidence it's that he knows that Langenhoven wrote Die Stem which tends to show that Mr Walus is a person who has deep knowledge of the Afrikaner history, the struggle of the CP and he was not an ordinary person acting under orders but was a person committed to the cause of the CP.",

            "The Act as a whole and particularly (d) and particularly (d), speaking for myself, I find it difficult to see a logical reason for the deletion of (a).  If I had had the time, I would have gone to Hansard in the hope of some, but it doesn't matter, but what we do ask, Mr Chairman is that on the question of fact, consideration should be given whether or not there were any reasonable grounds that either of the two Applicants had for believing that they were acting in the scope and course of their membership of the Conservative Party.\n\tTo consider it and come to a strong finding we would submit that there were no such reasonable grounds.  Because it was canvassed and may I recall to the Committee's memory that there were questions about why the leadership wasn't asked, why no steps were taken as to whether assassination would be tolerated or authorised or whether it was the business of the CP.  \n\tAnd what we want to submit on the facts in relation to that, that a position of a leader such as the Second Applicant, Mr Derby-Lewis, the position of reasonable grounds of belief, surely must be different where one has a cadre in the bush who has to make a decision, who is operating underground, that has no lines of communication with his leadership.  \n\tHe may say well, I was given an order to infiltrate into the country, a policeman stood in front of me and I decided that, in the furtherance of my liberation movements actions I had to shoot him otherwise I would be shot or I would be arrested and sentenced to a long term of imprisonment.\n\tThe test to be on the facts, it's not a different Law, it's the test to be applied on the state of mind of a person who is a member of an organisation that has, contrary to the CP's position, adopted violence as an option and where there are people on the ground who cannot communicate properly and take instructions in relation to specific events and they may sometimes go contrary to the policy of their organisation.\n\tBut if they reasonably believe that that was within their mandate, then they would be entitled to amnesty but they start off on a different premise.  They had a mandate to commit acts of violence by their organisations, given to them by their leaders who have taken responsibility, who had publicly stated that violence, there comes a time in the life of any nation where there is no option left but violence and then publicly declare that this is the policy of the organisation.\n\tNow, a person that commits that act, there may be an enquiry as to whether or not, even though it may have fallen outside the policy of the organisation whether he may reasonably have believed that it was within the scope, course and scope of his, the task that had been appointed to him or her.  Here we have no policy of violence by the CP, no task bestowed upon either of the Applicants to perform any act of violence and most certainly not assassination of a high profile political leader.\n\tAs we submitted yesterday, is a, makes a difference.  Let me not be misunderstood Mr Chairman, we are not saying that the life of a leader is less or more dear to the people involved than the most lowly and unlettered individual who finds himself in the struggle.  But what we do say is that the consequences of eliminating a high profile leader are so materially different to any other act and where we have a case where they say that they intended to create chaos when we have the leader of their party saying to Mr Venter that they had a policy of non violence, we submit that that is a different situation all together.\n\tNow in relation to the question put to me by the Judge presiding sir, what I want to say is that clearly, Sub Paragraph 3 of Section 20 must be cumulatively read.  In our submission what it means is this, that even if an Applicant might satisfy one of the requirements, that does not entitle him to amnesty is he or she does not satisfy the other requirements.  And it can be illustrated in a very simple way.  That there was full disclosure.\n\tIf you come here and you say, to take the extreme case, I did it with others, but out of loyalty to them I refuse to identify them or I refuse to tell you who gave me the order from above because he is my political leader and I don't want to implicate him, he hasn't applied for amnesty, therefore I am not speaking.\n\tWell, even though his act may be proportional or it may have been with an objective within the ambit of the act, that person must be refused amnesty in our respectful submission because he has not complied with one of the essential elements.  Similarly, if he does not show that he did not have authority, we believe that that is the end of the matter, even though he may have satisfied other requirements.  \n\tSimilarly even if all other criteria are satisfied, if it is so grossly inappropriate and disproportional to their act that it was a reaction to and if it was to create chaos in which hundreds, if not thousands of people were to be killed and which on their own admission was going to lead up to a race war.  Let us just examine their own evidence, we don't have to speculate in this case.  Their own evidence killing Hani would have induced black people in the country to turn and kill whites. \n\tThe whites would have been so disgusted with F W De Klerk's Government that they would appeal to the Security Forces to take over and hand over the staff of office to the right.  Now that is an act which most certainly doesn't fall into any of the Sub Sections of Sub Section 3 and particularly the relationship between the act and the political objective pursued and in particular, the directness and proximity of the relationship of proportionality of the act, omission or offence to the objectives pursued.\n\tIf we go to (A), the motive, can one in a country which has so many hues of colour, so many religious denominations, so many cultural and linguistic groups, think of anything worse that any human being could commit in order to induce a race war in South Africa.  That black people must first kill white people and white people must go out and kill lots of black people so that law and order is not there and a crises is created.\n\tMr Chairman, you have heard the evidence of Mr Jeremy Cronin, that had it not been for the leadership of Mr Nelson Mandela, Mr ...[inaudible] and others to calm the incensed majority of the people of South Africa.  We were on the brink of a race war but it was avoided, no fault to the two Applicants.  So that those are the submissions that we make on the facts and the proportionality of the act, of the objective to be pursued, I am merely, Mr Chairman, I don't want to read it out, I have given the main submissions, they are set out on paper, could I ask you to turn to Page 46 and add the, where we say, [Clause 10 (a) and (b)] and not only (b) Mr Chairman on Page 46, the third line - Bundle, at the end of that paragraph, Mr Chairman, at the end of 12.2, at the end of 12.1, just before 12.2, would you please add, Bundle A which are the Applications, Page 7, second last paragraph, Bundle A, Page 8, third paragraph.

            "Mr Chairman, I now want to turn to the question of the admissibility of the R4 statements.  The submissions are set out in full.  Their references to the statements and to the evidence that has been given and the responses of the witnesses that gave evidence and whose statements were put to them.\n\tThe net result of it Mr Chairman is, that between Pages 50 and 68 of the Heads of Argument we set this out.  Counsel for the Applicants had these Heads of Argument from Wednesday morning, certainly their Attorney by Wednesday morning, they say that they got it on Thursday.  Be that as it may, we have heard no argument or submission in relation to the Law or the correctness of the fact that we have set out on these pages.\n\tUnless the members of the Committee have any questions to put to us in relation to this, I do not propose dealing with it on the basis that no issue has been joined on it and above all there was a ruling in relation to the admissibility when the matter was argued which we quote in the Heads of Argument for the convenience of the Committee and the effect of the ruling was that it's not a question of admissibility but a question of weight.\n\tNow, what we submit, that on the matters upon which we rely on these statements, there have been answers from Mr and Mrs Derby-Lewis and Mr Walus to the effect, and the references are there, that they did not tell any, they were not forced to tell any untruths, either as a result of violence, threats or trickery.  On the contrary, most of the evidence relates to how sympathetic the police were to them, how, if they were bluffed, they say that they were bluffed, they said that they actually have sympathy for them and for the Afrikaner cause and that one of them at least had some contact with someone else and that he was an agent for an organisation.  But all that means nothing more than this, that if they did get their confidence it was because of how good they were to them.  There has been, and we deal with each one of the original complaints, which are negative by other evidence, for instance that the police who treated Mr Derby-Lewis, but he wrote a letter thanking them, how wonderful they are, they were and how wonderful they had treated them.\n\tMrs Derby-Lewis expressing a desire that when she comes out and she would want to join the police on the basis that there would of course not be substantial changes.  Now, and Mr Walus, when asked, before the adjournment you will recall Mr Chairman, what was his real complaint about the conduct of the police and did they force him to make any of the statements, he said he never made any statements, they were just friendly chats that he had with the police.\n\tWell these friendly chats have been reduced into an Affidavit by Mr Deetliefs, they have been, tapes have been made available.  There were 21 of them, they have been in the possession of the legal representatives of the Applicant for a very long time.  You heard Mr Chairman the complaints, the complaints relate as to who mentioned Langenhoven and one or two other comparatively minor matters.\n\tThere has been no attempt to dispel the suggestions coming from their own clients that they spoke the truth in their statements, that they did so because they trusted the police.  It is perhaps unfortunate from their point of view that the docket was made available to us in order to expose their lack of honesty and their full disclosure in this.  But that's no ground for excluding the evidence.\n\tMr Chairman, we have not had an opportunity of viewing the snippets of the tapes that were mentioned by Counsel for the First Applicant.  We would like, we didn't want to ask for adjournments and to add to the troubles of the Committee and ourselves in relation to this Application.  We would like leave Mr Chairman, upon adjournment to view those three matters because it may be nothing more than what happened in relation to Mrs Derby-Lewis' statements, that they did not appear in the correct section of the tape but we found them somewhere else.  So we would like to do that.\n\tIn relation to Mrs Derby-Lewis, the matter is much more strengthened in favour of our contention that her statements are admissible, that they were freely and voluntarily made and we ask the Committee to accept, unreservedly the evidence of Mr  De Waal who angrily denied any suggestion that he had  used any undue influence.  The evidence admitted by Mrs Derby-Lewis, that arrangements were made to get her own doctor in, every one of her requests was complied with, including going to get money for her son and clothes and magazines and everything else.\n\tWe know that detention without trial, with a great amount of justification has a very bad name in this country and many of us spent the better part of their lives condemning it.  But the other factor to be taken into consideration is that by the time Mr and Mrs Derby-Lewis were put under Section 29 of the Security Act, it was a completely sanitised Act, which provided for judicial intervention before, after the period of ten days in which, at a time when fundamental human rights were being promoted in the country by the large political parties and liberation movements and that it was a completely different atmosphere.\n\tThe fact that they could not point to a single untruth, that they have told because of being held under interrogation.  Of course, sleep deprivation, lengthy interrogation are matters upon which Judges and those involved with the Human Rights culture cannot approve of or condone and the country has set it's face against that sort of practise.\n\tBut, the treatment metered out to these three persons was salutary in the circumstances.  Having regard to what they were suspected of at the time, of committing an act which almost brought the country to the brink of war.\n\tIn conclusion, on Page 68, Mr Chairman, is that, we submit that the version by Mr and Mrs Derby-Lewis in evidence is both contradictory and improbable in material respects and should not be accepted.  This is irrespective of the admissibility of their statements to the police.  Derby-Lewis who did not give evidence in his trial, perjured himself in an Application to re-open the trial to prove his innocence.  He relies on the support expressed to him when he was falsely holding out, that he was innocent and claimed that his arrest was a pretext to embarrass the Conservative Party.  Without any apology to anyone, he now admits that he lied in that Application and he was indeed guilty of the murder that he committed.\n\tHis wife admits that she lied at the trial about how Walus obtained the list.  She says that she did it to protect her husband.  I don't have to remind you that she said it must have been taken by mistake with piles of Die Patriot on their coffee table.  If she was prepared to be deliberately untruthful on one of the main issues at the trial to protect her husband, why should she not lie to get him out of prison.\n\tThe improbability that the list was compiled for journalistic purposes could not be sustained during cross examination.  She could not sustain the fanciful story in many respects.  The contradictions between the two Applicants that were serious and too near the main issue to be ignored as suggested by their Counsel.  \n\tThe attempt to make out a case  of implied authority on the numerous articles and editorials in Die Patriot to which Mrs Derby-Lewis regularly contributed is a last ditch effort by those responsible for disseminating McCarthy-like propaganda, asking to be believed when they say they were influenced by that propaganda.\n\tDerby-Lewis reducing his role to a minimum, that he still wanted to think it over and Walus belatedly saying that he was ordered when elsewhere they state that they acted as co-conspirators makes their evidence suspect and not worthy of belief.  The criteria of their act are clear, they have not made full disclosure, they were not authorised, their object was to bring about a savage civil war of black against white for their poorly articulated purposes.  \n\tThey were guided partly by religious bigotry, they make reference, the two of them and Mr Clark of Mr Hani being the anti Christ, hatred for blacks and democracy and in the case of Walus, hatred for Communism as a result of what happened in Poland, where he did nothing to put right but murdered in South Africa to cause chaos, to bring the right into power.\n\tThe life of a charismatic leader was cut short Mr Chairman, we do not contend that his life was more precious than any unlettered peasant nor worker in a factory nor indeed any other human being, whatever his or her position in the community.  But as was pointed out by ...[inaudible] of JP in his Judgment on sentence, the accused performed an act of assassination on a person who had attained prominence in public affairs in South Africa, whose killing was likely to the knowledge of the accused, to cause far reaching, highly emotive reactions with very damaging serious consequences and extremely harmful effects for the entire society of South Africa.\n\tThe accused was a mature person with experience in public affairs, who must have realised what widespread reactions would follow on the assassination.  We are here concerned with a case of assassination of a person prominent in public life by reason of the ideologies which he endorsed and because of the perception that his track record was unacceptable.  \n\tThat sort of perception should be sought, I suppose Mr Chairman, might be entertained by thousands of people in this country for a variety of reasons, of many personages who have obtained prominence in public life.  If assassination of that sort is perceived to be an acceptable option in this country the consequences may well be disastrous, chaos, anarchy, widespread bloodshed and damage to property is likely to result.  The political consequences may also be fundamental.\n\tI have given careful thought to the experiences of the Accused No. 1 in relation to Communism and the perception of both the accused in the role of the deceased.  This factor may render the act of all accused understandable if it were not the killing, would have been utterly senseless.\n\tMr Chairman, I want to pause here for a moment.  You are asked to let loose the two Applicants.  You have seen and heard Mr Clark, one of the close disciples of Mr Derby-Lewis, completely lacking in judgment, a fanaticism which our country can do without.  Having regard to the gravity of their offence, having regard to the fact that they wanted to create chaos in South Africa, having regard to the fact that neither of them expressly and by clear implication has shown that they have no respect for the provisions of the Constitution, that Mr Clark very clearly stated that he will never accept a unitary state in South Africa, which is a rejection of the Constitution.\n\tWe do not have before you Mr Chairman and members of the Committee people who have in the words of the preamble of the Act, that calls for democracy and peaceful co-existence for all South Africans irrespective of colour, race, class, belief or sex.  Mr Derby-Lewis tells us, yes, let the blacks go to their homelands and they can exercise those rights, it would give us the better part of South Africa as our own Volkstad.  \n\tThey do not believe in national unity or the reconstruction of a common society.  The overall purpose of the Act is to reconcile the people of South Africa and for people to come and make full disclosure and although they are not obliged to say sorry, they must at least show that they have come to terms with the sort of society that the vast majority of the people in South Africa want.\n\tThe release of these two men will probably lead to another little clique and cabal being established somewhere in Krugersdorp and elsewhere, where the freedom of expression, freedom of movement and freedom of association given to even them, in terms of the Constitution will probably be abused in order to pursue their irrational and fanatical ideas that lead them to the assassination.  \n\tFor all these reasons Mr Chairman we ask that the Committee refuse the Applications for Amnesty.
