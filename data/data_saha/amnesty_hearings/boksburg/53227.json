And I was at work on that very day, and when I came back from work I went straight to my shack.\n\tAnd as I was sitting in my shack one IFP member came to me, his name is Joseph Mkhize.  He did not knock, he just pushed the door and entered.  And when I enquired as to what was happening he just pushed the door and came in, and before he could respond I noticed that he was wearing his jersey right inside my shack.  And when I enquired as to what was happening, he informed me, he said to me, that I am sitting here whilst people are dying outside.  And when I enquired as to who were fighting, he informed me that the IFP and the ANC were fighting.  And I wanted to know the reason thereof, and he said, \"...man there's no time for explanation, I am here, I wanted to put my jersey on, I am fleeing, I'm going to sleep across the Jukskei River.\"  And I then said to him, \"...I am not staying behind, I am accompanying you to your girlfriend where you are going to spend your night.\"  I then put on my jacket and locked the door.  We then left.\n\tAnd a distance from my shack, at a distance from my shack I saw people, women who were carrying their babies on their backs, hurrying, and I could see where these women were going, and this group of women accumulated as the singing was going on.  And as I looked around there is one very big street that was the entry point into our area, and as I cast my eyes towards that point I saw a group of amabuto on that very same street.  These people were carrying knopkierries as well as spears.  They were chanting, and they were not standing still but they were moving downwards.  That is when I got a fright, because I, it now occurred to me that what he was saying is the truth.  And we swiftly took the downward direction with the intention of crossing the Jukskei River.  We could not cross the river became it was overflowing.\n\tWe then went back and on our going back we could see the IFP members or group moving upwards.  We joined them and they had gone upwards at the time.  And after a while we arrived at Brown's shack, if I'm not mistaken.",

And the attorneys themselves, namely Messrs Nel Kotze and van Dyk, never had sight of those applications, but they were informed of them and that's why they filed this affidavit as an addendum.  \n\tWhen it appeared that the earlier application hadn't been received, they completed the ones which are now in the docket, so it would seem the prospects of us tracing and finding those earlier applications are almost zero. \n\tIs there anything you would like to add Ms Lockhat?",

Before we arrived at Sithole's house, we, Sithole actually came in the company of Zwane and Mpongosi and Sithole's boy, as well as another boy called Mbuso.  He was a leader of the Inkatha youth brigade.  And when we met them these other people stood behind Sithole and Sithole came to the fore and asked, or should I say my brother asked Sithole as to whether he had heard that Mpongosi had attacked people at Maloesi's shebeen.  Sithole denied knowledge of that.\nAt that time Mpongosi was present.  Zwane and Mbuso, as well  as Sithole's son, had firearms.  Sithole did not have a firearm.  Mpongosi did not have a firearm.  All of these had these handguns.  When Sithole arrived denying knowledge of that my brother said, \"...Yes, that is exactly the reason why we are here, we wanted us to inform you about the fact that they had threatened people, saying they are coming back and they will shoot them when they get back.  And they threatened to shoot any ANC member within the area.\"  Sithole then said to Dastile, \"...Go and talk to the ANC people, I, Sithole, will go and talk to IFP members.\"  He was saying that because my brother said, \"...Sithole let us please stop this.  Let it not continue, because many places are faced with violence and should this start it will never stop.\"  That is why it was agreed that he should talk to the ANC and the other one to the IFP.  \nAnd when we went to the ANC, and at that time I must point out that people had gathered at the ANC office, worrying about the threats. We came to address the people about that.  My brother actually was the one who was to address them on that matter.  And as he was addressing them people said, \"...This is not an empty threat.  It looks like Inkatha are intent on doing something today.\"  My brother said Sithole will not allow that to happen.  And after Dastile had addressed the people, the people seemed to understand and he had to go back to Sithole to report back, because he was, Sithole that is, was going to talk to the IFP and they had to report back to each other.  And Dastile was again delegated, together with his deputy Caswell Tchala, they were delegated to go and talk to Sithole and establish as to how this can be resolved.  I volunteered to accompany them so that I could be the third person.  I wanted to hear this myself.\n\tAnd on our way, or just before we left, many people said, \"...You cannot go there alone, we will rather accompany you to hear everything ourselves.\"  And my brother said, \"...That is not a good idea, it will look like we are fighting.\"  And people were running, carrying their weapons, and it was indicated that if that is the case let us leave our weapons behind.  Indeed people agreed, and we started walking.  We were, there was a distance of about 20 metres between ourselves and the group that was following us.

            "And when this throng of people approached, they were walking swiftly, and when they were closer we started hearing a gunshot.  And we all left the street where we were standing and we went towards Brown's shack behind which we hid.  They also came and they hid behind the other side of the very same shack, and one person would peep and try to aim at the target with an intention of shooting, and we started throwing stones.  \tI think 10 minutes could have elapsed, the same thing was happening, trying to aim, shooting, hiding.  Zwane came, I don't know his name, I just know his surname, that's how we used to relate to each other.  When Zwane came he positioned himself such that we the ANC could see him, and he shot towards the ANC group.  The one first person who fell was Qolile Present, I'm not sure whether the pronunciation is correct here.  He, Qolile fell just in front of me, I was standing behind her.  And I also fell after I was struck by a bullet around the neck, and when I tried to rise I could not, because as I was trying to rise I could see a ball of  fire crossing through my eyes, or in front of me.\nAt that very same moment I heard my brother calling out to me saying, \"...These people have hurt me.\"  I went to my brother and held his hand, at that moment I realised that he was losing his strength.  There is one other person who came and assisted me.  There were two of these ANC members and we, they carried him on the shoulders, suggesting that I should leave him because I was injured as well.  And they carried Qolile too.  \nWe went up towards the TPA office and some of us at the time were throwing stones at these people, trying to distract them, and as our group was retreating backwards, that is when Mr Sithole climbed onto the rooftop of Mr Brown's shack and he knelt and started aiming at us.  He started shooting.  That is when I identified him as Mr Sithole because I knew him very well, he was always with us.  \n\tAnd once we were at the TPA they turned back half-way from Brown's place.  They too were also pelting us with stones.  They returned and they went down a street that is now named Dastile Street.  They took that street and went further down.  I don't know where they ended up.  And at that time we were injured and we were at the TPA offices waiting for an ambulance.",
